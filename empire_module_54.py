Sure, building an advanced Python module with intelligent recursion is an exciting challenge. Let's create a Python module that specializes in solving complex mathematical problems using recursive techniques. We'll include features such as memoization to optimize the recursive calls and intelligent decision-making to handle different types of inputs strategically.

Hereâ€™s an example module called `intelligent_recursion.py` that demonstrates these concepts:

```python
"""
intelligent_recursion.py

This module provides advanced recursive functions with intelligent optimization
and decision-making capabilities, designed for complex problem-solving.

from functools import lru_cache

class FactorialSolver:
    """Class to compute factorial using intelligent recursion."""

    @staticmethod
    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def factorial(n):
        """Calculate factorial with memoization to enhance performance."""
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Negative inputs are not allowed")
        elif n == 0 or n == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            return n * FactorialSolver.factorial(n - 1)


class FibonacciSolver:
    """Class to compute Fibonacci numbers using intelligent recursion."""

    @staticmethod
    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def fibonacci(n):
        """Calculate nth Fibonacci number with memoization."""
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Negative inputs are not allowed")
        elif n == 0:
            return 0
        elif n == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            return FibonacciSolver.fibonacci(n - 1) + FibonacciSolver.fibonacci(n - 2)


class GCDSolver:
    """Class to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) using recursion."""

    @staticmethod
    def gcd(a, b):
        """Calculate GCD using Euclidean algorithm."""
        if b == 0:
            return a
        else:
            return GCDSolver.gcd(b, a % b)


def intelligent_recursion(func):
    """Decorator to intelligently decide whether to use recursion."""
    def wrapper(*args):
        if len(args) == 1 and isinstance(args[0], int):
            return func(args[0])
        elif len(args) == 2:
            return func(*args)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Function not suitable for provided arguments")
    return wrapper


@intelligent_recursion
def power(base, exp):
    """Compute base^exp using recursion."""
    if exp < 0:
        raise ValueError("Negative exponent not supported")
    elif exp == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return base * power(base, exp - 1)


# Example test case application within this module
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Factorial of 5:", FactorialSolver.factorial(5))
    print("10th Fibonacci number:", FibonacciSolver.fibonacci(10))
    print("GCD of 48 and 18:", GCDSolver.gcd(48, 18))
    print("2^10:", power(2, 10))
```

In this module:

1. **FactorialSolver** and **FibonacciSolver** classes use memoization via `functools.lru_cache` to store previously computed results, eliminating redundant calculations and boosting performance.

2. **GCDSolver** employs a recursive method to find the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.

3. `intelligent_recursion` is a decorator designed to choose when to apply recursive computation intelligently based on input type and number of arguments.

4. The `power` function demonstrates how recursion can be applied to different kinds of numerical computations, with error handling for inappropriate inputs. 

You can expand this module further by adding more recursive algorithms and utilizing different optimization techniques, enhancing its applicability for various complex problem-solving tasks.
