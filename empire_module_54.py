Creating an advanced Python module with intelligent recursion for the PTM empire would involve designing a module that demonstrates robust recursive techniques tailored for complex problem-solving scenarios. Below is a conceptual start to such a module with a focus on recursion, memoization, and handling deep recursive calls in a manageable way. For demonstration purposes, let's consider creating a module for computing advanced recursive formulas, such as those found in computational mathematics or complex algorithms.

Here is a sample implementation of an advanced recursion module designed to handle complex recursive processes efficiently:

```python
# ptm_recursion.py

class PTMRecursion:
    def __init__(self):
        # Use a dictionary for memoization
        self.memo = {}

    def intelligent_recurse(self, function, *args):
        """
        Recursively call a provided function with intelligent features
        including memoization to store previously computed results.
        
        Args:
            function: Function to be recursively called.
            *args: Arguments to pass to the function.
        
        Returns:
            The result of the recursive function call.
        """
        # Create a unique key based on the function name and arguments
        key = (function.__name__, args)

        # Check if the result is already computed
        if key in self.memo:
            print(f"Retrieving memoized result for {key}")
            return self.memo[key]

        # Call the function and store the result in the memo dictionary
        result = function(*args)
        self.memo[key] = result

        return result

    @staticmethod
    def fibonacci(n):
        """
        Compute the nth Fibonacci number using standard recursion.

        Args:
            n (int): The position in the Fibonacci sequence.
        
        Returns:
            The nth Fibonacci number.
        """
        if n <= 1:
            return n
        else:
            return PTMRecursion.fibonacci(n - 1) + PTMRecursion.fibonacci(n - 2)

    def fib_with_memo(self, n):
        """
        Compute the nth Fibonacci number using intelligent recursion
        with memoization.

        Args:
            n (int): The position in the Fibonacci sequence.

        Returns:
            The nth Fibonacci number.
        """
        return self.intelligent_recurse(self._fibonacci_helper, n)

    def _fibonacci_helper(self, n):
        if n <= 1:
            return n
        else:
            return self.intelligent_recurse(self._fibonacci_helper, n - 1) + \
                   self.intelligent_recurse(self._fibonacci_helper, n - 2)

    def clear_memo(self):
        """Clear the memo dictionary."""
        self.memo.clear()

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ptm_recursion = PTMRecursion()

    n = 35  # Adjust to a value that shows difference between memoized and non-memoized
    print(f"Computing Fibonacci number without memoization: {n}")
    print(f"Result: {PTMRecursion.fibonacci(n)}")

    print(f"\nComputing Fibonacci number with intelligent recursion: {n}")
    fib_n = ptm_recursion.fib_with_memo(n)
    print(f"Result: {fib_n}")

    # Clear memoization cache
    ptm_recursion.clear_memo()
```

The module `ptm_recursion.py` introduces:
- A base class `PTMRecursion` for handling recursive functions with intelligent features like memoization.
- An `intelligent_recurse` method which takes another function as an argument and manages recursion with memoization, reducing redundant calculations.
- A standard recursive Fibonacci function and a version with intelligent recursion to demonstrate the performance gains through memoization.
- The ability to clear memoized results, providing a way to manage memory and state within the recursive process.

You can extend this module by adding more intelligent recursion functionalities or more complex mathematical recursion problems that benefit from such intelligent management.
