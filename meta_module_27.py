Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional entity) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack involves several critical components, particularly focusing on flexibility, adaptability, and recursive strategies. Below is an outline and sample implementation for a Python module named `ptm_autonomy`. This module will focus on recursive learning, dynamic decision-making, and self-improvement. 

### Key Components:

1. **Recursive Learning Framework**: Implement a recursive approach to machine learning where models can continuously refine their predictions by learning from new data and their own past mistakes.

2. **Dynamic Decision Engine**: A system that adapts decisions based on real-time data and historical context, utilizing reinforcement learning to optimize outcomes.

3. **Self-Improvement Protocol**: Mechanisms for the system to assess and improve its performance iteratively through feedback loops.

4. **Modular and Extensible Architecture**: Ensure the design is modular for future expansion and integration with other technologies.

### Implementation Outline:

import numpy as np
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, RegressorMixin
from typing import Any, List, Tuple

class RecursiveLearningModel(BaseEstimator, RegressorMixin):
    def __init__(self, model: Any = None):
        self.model = model  # Placeholder for a machine learning model
    
    def fit(self, X, y):
        # Fitting the model (should be recursively updated)
        self.model.fit(X, y)
    
    def predict(self, X):
        # Predict using the fitted model
        return self.model.predict(X)
    
    def recursive_train(self, X, y, epochs: int = 10):
        for epoch in range(epochs):
            self.fit(X, y)
            predictions = self.predict(X)
            residuals = y - predictions
            # Update model with residuals
            X = self._enhance_features(X, residuals)
    
    def _enhance_features(self, X, residuals):
        # Example feature enhancement by adding residuals to the dataset
        return np.hstack((X, residuals.reshape(-1, 1)))

class DynamicDecisionEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = {}
    
    def update_state(self, new_data: dict):
        self.state.update(new_data)
    
    def decide():> str:
        # Placeholder for decision-making logic
        # Use state and contextual data to make decisions
        # Example: return 'action'
        return "Implement Logic"
    
    def reinforce(self, reward: float):
        # Update decision engine based on reward feedback
        pass

class SelfImprovementProtocol:
    def __init__(self):
        self.progress_log: List[Tuple[str, float]] = []

    def assess_and_improve(self, feedback: float):
        # Record performance and apply improvements
        self.progress_log.append((self.current_state(), feedback))
    
    def current_state():> str:
        # Example current state description
        return "State"
    
    def iterate_improvements(self):
        # Iterate through self-improvement protocols
        pass

# Example usage
def main():
    # Initialize components
    recursive_model = RecursiveLearningModel(model=SomeSklearnModel())
    decision_engine = DynamicDecisionEngine()
    improvement_protocol = SelfImprovementProtocol()
    
    # Recursive training
    X, y = load_data()  # Example data loading function
    recursive_model.recursive_train(X, y)

    # Dynamic decision making
    new_data = {"sensor1": 1.0}
    decision_engine.update_state(new_data)
    action = decision_engine.decide(new_data)

    # Self-improvement
    feedback = get_feedback()  # Example feedback function
    improvement_protocol.assess_and_improve(feedback)
    improvement_protocol.iterate_improvements()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Considerations:

- **Scalability**: Design with scalability in mind, ensuring the ability to process large amounts of data and incorporate new learning algorithms.
- **Modularity**: Use a modular design to allow parts of the module to be updated or extended independently.
- **Security**: Consider data security and integrity when designing the module.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to track performance and make adjustments as needed.

### Future Extensions:

- Integration with real-time data sources.
- Expansion to incorporate more complex machine learning models.
- Continuous reinforcement learning and online learning capabilities.
- Automated hyperparameter tuning for recursive models.

This serves as an abstract framework for expanding the PTM empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack with a focus on adaptability and advanced decision-making capabilities. Each component can be refined and extended to match specific requirements and constraints.
