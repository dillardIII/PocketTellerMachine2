Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can adapt, learn, and evolve its capabilities over time using recursive strategies. The module should facilitate decision-making processes, optimize performance, and improve autonomously.

Here's a conceptual overview of how you might design this module:

### Module Name: `autonomy_stack`

#### Key Features:

1. **Recursive Learning Algorithm**:
   - Implement a self-learning algorithm that recursively improves its understanding of the environment through continuous feedback loops. This can be done using reinforcement learning (RL) and evolutionary algorithms.

2. **Hierarchical Task Decomposition**:
   - Employ recursive decomposition of complex tasks into simpler subtasks, facilitating efficient management and parallel execution.

3. **Adaptive Neural Networks**:
   - Incorporate neural networks capable of dynamically adjusting their architectureâ€”adding, pruning, or modifying nodes and layers based on performance metrics and environmental feedback.

4. **Contextual Understanding**:
   - Develop a mechanism for recursive contextual analysis, enhancing the module's situational awareness and decision-making by continuously refining its perception of current conditions.

5. **Evolutionary Strategy**:
   - Use recursive strategies inspired by natural evolution to autonomously test and refine algorithms, optimizing for both individual tasks and overall system performance.

6. **Robust Communication Protocols**:
   - Implement protocols that allow autonomous agents within the system to recursively share knowledge and strategies, promoting a collaborative learning environment.

7. **Self-Monitoring and Self-Repair**:
   - Enable functionalities for self-diagnosis and repair, using recursive checks to identify anomalies and rectify issues without human intervention.

#### Code Structure:

```python
# autonomy_stack/__init__.py
__all__ = ['RecursiveLearner', 'TaskDecomposition', 'AdaptiveNeuralNet', 'ContextAnalyzer', 'EvolutionaryManager', 'CommunicationProtocol', 'SelfRepairSystem']

# autonomy_stack/recursive_learner.py
class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize learning parameters
        self.model = None

    def learn(self, environment_state):
        # Implement the learning strategy
        pass

# autonomy_stack/task_decomposition.py
class TaskDecomposition:
    def __init__(self):
        # Setup task decomposition parameters
        pass

    def decompose(self, task):
        # Recursively break down the task
        pass

# autonomy_stack/adaptive_neural_net.py
class AdaptiveNeuralNet:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize neural network
        self.network = []

    def adjust(self, feedback):
        # Dynamically modify the network
        pass

# autonomy_stack/context_analyzer.py
class ContextAnalyzer:
    def analyze(self, data):
        # Perform recursive contextual analysis
        pass

# autonomy_stack/evolutionary_manager.py
class EvolutionaryManager:
    def evolve(self, strategies):
        # Implement evolutionary optimization
        pass

# autonomy_stack/communication_protocol.py
class CommunicationProtocol:
    def __init__(self):
        # Setup communication parameters
        pass

    def share_knowledge(self, agents):
        # Recursive communication strategy
        pass

# autonomy_stack/self_repair_system.py
class SelfRepairSystem:
    def monitor(self):
        # Recursive monitoring for system health
        pass

    def repair(self):
        # Implement self-repair routines
        pass
```

### Key Considerations:

- **Scalability**: The system should function seamlessly as the complexity and volume of tasks increase.
- **Modularity**: Modules should be interchangeable and independently evolve over time.
- **Integration**: Ensure compatibility with pre-existing components of the PTM empire's autonomy stack.
- **Security**: Implement robust measures to protect against malicious exploits and data breaches.

This module design emphasizes recursive strategies to foster adaptive, autonomous systems capable of self-improvement and efficient task execution, contributing to the growth and robustness of the PTM empire's autonomy stack.
