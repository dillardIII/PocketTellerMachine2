To design a new Python module that expands the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack, a focus on recursive strategies is critical. We aim to build an adaptive, intelligent system that can evolve over time by self-assessing and incorporating new data and strategies. The following outlines a conceptual framework and code for such a module:

### Conceptual Framework

1. **Core Components:**
   - **Data Acquisition**: Continuous streaming and collection of real-time data.
   - **Recursive Learning**: Using recursive algorithms to refine models iteratively.
   - **Decision Making**: Autonomous decision-making based on learned models.
   - **Self-Evaluation**: Regular assessment of performance metrics and adjustments.
   - **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Integrating genetic algorithms to evolve solutions.

2. **Recursive Strategies:**
   - Employ recursive neural networks (RNN) or long short-term memory networks (LSTM) for learning and prediction.
   - Implement recursive decision tree pruning to optimize and refine decision paths.
   - Use recursive reinforcement learning for iterative policy improvement.

3. **Adaptive Mechanisms:**
   - Enable dynamic model updates using incoming data streams.
   - Develop mechanisms for the system to autonomously identify, evaluate, and integrate new data features.

### Sample Python Module

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from deap import base, creator, tools, algorithms

class PTMEmpireAutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = None
        self.history = []
    
    def data_acquisition(self):
        # Placeholder for data gathering logic
        # E.g., self.data = stream_data_from_source()
        pass
    
    def recursive_neural_learning(self, input_data):
        model = tf.keras.Sequential([
            tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(input_data.shape[1], input_data.shape[2]), return_sequences=True),
            tf.keras.layers.LSTM(32),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='softmax')
        ])
        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
        self.model = model
    
    def recursive_decision_tree(self):
        # Example of recursive tree pruning strategy
        dtree = DecisionTreeClassifier()
        dtree.fit(X_train, y_train)
        self.prune_tree(dtree)
    
    def prune_tree(self, tree):
        # Implementing pruning logic
        # Recursively prune nodes to avoid overfitting
        for node in tree.tree_.__getstate__()['nodes']:
            if node['impurity'] < 0.1:  # Example condition:
                node['left_child'] = node['right_child'] = -1
    
    def reinforcement_learning(self, environment):
        # Recursive Q-learning example
        q_table = np.zeros([environment.observation_space.n, environment.action_space.n])
        alpha, gamma, epsilon = 0.1, 0.6, 0.1
        
        def q_learning(state, action, reward, next_state):
            best_next_action = np.argmax(q_table[next_state])
            td_target = reward + gamma * q_table[next_state, best_next_action]
            q_table[state, action] += alpha * (td_target - q_table[state, action])
        
        self.q_learning_algorithm = q_learning
    
    def evolutionary_algorithm(self):
        creator.create("FitnessMax", base.Fitness, weights=(1.0,))
        creator.create("Individual", list, fitness=creator.FitnessMax)
        
        def evalOneMax(individual):
            return sum(individual),
        
        toolbox = base.Toolbox()
        toolbox.register("attr_bool", np.random.randint, 2)
        toolbox.register("individual", tools.initRepeat, creator.Individual, toolbox.attr_bool, 100)
        toolbox.register("population", tools.initRepeat, list, toolbox.individual)
        toolbox.register("evaluate", evalOneMax)
        toolbox.register("mate", tools.cxTwoPoint)
        toolbox.register("mutate", tools.mutFlipBit, indpb=0.05)
        toolbox.register("select", tools.selTournament, tournsize=3)
        
        self.evolution_algorithm = toolbox
    
    def self_evaluation(self):
        # Evaluate model performances
        accuracy = self.model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
        self.history.append(accuracy)
        if accuracy < self.desired_accuracy:
            self.retrain_model()
    
    def retrain_model(self):
        # Logic to retrain or adjust model based on evaluations
        pass

# Example usage
autonomy_stack = PTMEmpireAutonomyStack()
autonomy_stack.recursive_neural_learning(data_input)
autonomy_stack.recursive_decision_tree()
```

### Explanation

- **Data Acquisition and Recursive Neural Learning**: The data acquisition placeholder will interface with the real world or simulated environment to fetch data. A recursive neural network (LSTM) is then designed to process time-series data for pattern recognition and prediction.

- **Recursive Decision Tree and Pruning**: Utilizes decision tree classifiers and implements a custom pruning method to remove branches that do not improve model performance significantly.

- **Reinforcement Learning**: A simplified recursive Q-learning setup for autonomous decision-making with an incremental learning approach.

- **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Incorporates DEAP library tools to apply genetic algorithms for evolving solutions.

- **Self-Evaluation and Adaptive Learning**: The system evaluates its own performance over time and has mechanisms to initiate retraining or adjustments to the model structure if necessary.:

This module is designed to be modular, allowing for the integration of additional strategies and improvements as the system evolves. The sample code serves as a framework and can be further expanded to meet specific demands of the PTM empire's autonomy stack.
