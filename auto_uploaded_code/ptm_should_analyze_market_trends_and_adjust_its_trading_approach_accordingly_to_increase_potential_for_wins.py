Here is a basic example of how you could implement a Python trading bot that analyzes market trends and adjusts its trading approach accordingly. This example uses the `yfinance` library to get stock data, `pandas` to analyze the data, and `numpy` for calculations. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading bots are much more complex. This bot only considers the moving average of the stock price to make decisions, but you could add more indicators like RSI, MACD, etc.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, ticker, period='1d', interval='1m'):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.period = period
        self.interval = interval
        self.data = self.get_data()

    def get_data(self):
        return yf.download(self.ticker, period=self.period, interval=self.interval)

    def calculate_moving_average(self, window_size=10):
        return self.data['Close'].rolling(window=window_size).mean()

    def analyze_trends(self):
        ma = self.calculate_moving_average()
        price = self.data['Close'].iloc[-1]
        if price > ma.iloc[-1]:
            return 'uptrend'
        elif price < ma.iloc[-1]:
            return 'downtrend'
        else:
            return 'sideways'

    def adjust_trading_approach(self):
        trend = self.analyze_trends()
        if trend == 'uptrend':
            return 'buy'
        elif trend == 'downtrend':
            return 'sell'
        else:
            return 'hold'

ptm = PTM('AAPL')
print(ptm.adjust_trading_approach())
```

This script creates a class `PTM` for a trading bot. The bot fetches data for a given stock ticker using the `yfinance` library, calculates the moving average of the closing prices, and analyzes the trend based on the moving average. Depending on the trend, the bot adjusts its trading approach: if the trend is upwards, it decides to buy; if the trend is downwards, it decides to sell; if the trend is sideways, it decides to hold.

Please note that this is a very simplistic trading bot and is not suitable for real-world trading. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider many more factors, use more sophisticated algorithms, and also implement risk management strategies.
