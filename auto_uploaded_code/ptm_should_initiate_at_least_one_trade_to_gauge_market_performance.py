Sure, to initiate a trade, you would need to use an API provided by your broker. Here is an example of how you might do this using the Alpaca API, which is a popular API for trading stocks:

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

Please replace `'APCA-API-KEY-ID'` and `'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY'` with your actual API key ID and secret key.

This code will submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock. You can change the symbol to trade a different stock, change the qty to buy a different number of shares, or change 'buy' to 'sell' to sell shares instead of buying them.

Please note that this is a very basic example. In a real-world application, you would want to handle potential errors, and you might want to add more complex logic to decide when and what to trade.

Also, keep in mind that this code will not actually execute any trades unless you have a funded Alpaca account and you are using your real API keys. The URL 'https://paper-api.alpaca.markets' is for Alpaca's paper trading environment, which is a simulated environment for testing.
