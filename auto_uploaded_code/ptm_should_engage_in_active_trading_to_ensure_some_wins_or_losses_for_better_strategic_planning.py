Sure, I can certainly help with that. However, please note that trading involves a lot of complex factors and the code below is a simple simulation of trading strategy and does not necessarily guarantee success in real-life trading.

Assuming we are trading in stock market, I will use a simple Moving Average Crossover strategy for the purpose of demonstration. This strategy involves the use of two moving averages (a slow and a fast one), and trading decisions are based on the points where these moving averages intersect each other.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

# Fetching historical data
def fetch_data(stock, start, end):
    return pdr.get_data_yahoo(stock, start, end)

# Calculating moving averages
def calculate_moving_averages(df, short_window, long_window):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0
    signals['short_mavg'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
    signals['long_mavg'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()
    return signals

# Placing trades (buy/sell)
def place_trades(stock, signals):
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111,  ylabel='Price in $')
    stock['Close'].plot(ax=ax1, lw=2.)
    signals[['short_mavg', 'long_mavg']].plot(ax=ax1, lw=2.)
    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == 1.0].index, signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == 1.0], '^', markersize=10, color='m')
    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == -1.0].index, signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == -1.0], 'v', markersize=10, color='k')
    plt.show()

# main
if __name__ == "__main__":
    stock = fetch_data('AAPL', '2020-01-01', '2022-05-31')
    signals = calculate_moving_averages(stock, 40, 100)
    place_trades(stock, signals)
```
This script fetches historical data for a chosen stock ('AAPL' in this case) and calculates short term and long term moving averages based on the closing prices. When the short term moving average goes above the long term one (this point is called 'crossing'), it indicates a good time to buy and vice versa. The script then visualizes these trades on a graph.
