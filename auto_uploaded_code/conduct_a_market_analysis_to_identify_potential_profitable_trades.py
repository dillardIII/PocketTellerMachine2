To conduct a market analysis, we can use Python libraries like pandas, yfinance, and matplotlib. Here's a simple example of how we could analyze stock data to identify potential profitable trades. In this example, we'll use the Moving Average Crossover Strategy, which is a common strategy used in stock trading.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = "AAPL"
ticker_data = yf.download(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

# Calculate moving averages
short_window = 40
long_window = 100

signals = pd.DataFrame(index=ticker_data.index)
signals['signal'] = 0.0

# Short moving average
signals['short_mavg'] = ticker_data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

# Long moving average
signals['long_mavg'] = ticker_data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

# Create signals
signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                            > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   

# Generate trading orders
signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

# Print DataFrame
print(signals)

# Plotting
fig = plt.figure()
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111, ylabel='Price in $')
ticker_data["Close"].plot(ax=ax1, color='r', lw=2.)
signals[['short_mavg', 'long_mavg']].plot(ax=ax1, lw=2.)

# Plot the buy signals
ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == 1.0].index, 
         signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == 1.0],
         '^', markersize=10, color='m')

# Plot the sell signals
ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == -1.0].index, 
         signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == -1.0],
         'v', markersize=10, color='k')

plt.show()
```

This script will download the historical data for the Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, calculate the short and long moving averages, generate trading signals and plot the results. The buy signals are represented by magenta up-triangles, and the sell signals are represented by black down-triangles.

Please note that this is a very simple example and real trading strategies should consider many other factors. Always do your own research before making trading decisions.
