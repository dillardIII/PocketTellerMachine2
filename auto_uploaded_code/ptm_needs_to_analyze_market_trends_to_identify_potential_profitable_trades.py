Sure, here's a simple example of how you might use Python to analyze market trends. This example uses the pandas library to analyze data, and yfinance to download stock price data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical market data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2021-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['MA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Identify potential trades
# Buy signal: When MA_50 crosses above MA_200
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['MA_50'] > data['MA_200'])

# Sell signal: When MA_50 crosses below MA_200
data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['MA_50'] < data['MA_200'])

print(data)
```

This script downloads the historical market data for Apple (AAPL) from 2020 to 2021. It then calculates two moving averages: a 50-day moving average (MA_50) and a 200-day moving average (MA_200). 

The script generates a buy signal when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average, and a sell signal when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. These signals are based on a common trading strategy known as a moving average crossover.

Please note that this is a very simplistic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take many more factors into account. Also, this script does not take into account trading fees or other costs, and it does not guarantee profitability. Always do your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making trading decisions.
