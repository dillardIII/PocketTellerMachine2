To analyze market trends and opportunities for potential trades, we would need to use some kind of financial data. Here is a simple example of how you might do this using Python, pandas, and yfinance libraries. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take many more factors into consideration.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

# Download historical market data
yf.pdr_override()
data = pdr.get_data_yahoo("AAPL", start="2020-01-01", end="2021-12-31")

# Calculate moving averages
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Define a signal
data['Signal'] = 0.0
data['Signal'][50:] = np.where(data['SMA_50'][50:] > data['SMA_200'][50:], 1.0, 0.0)

# Generate trading orders
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Print data
print(data)

# Find potential trades
buy_signals = data[data['Position'] == 1.0]
sell_signals = data[data['Position'] == -1.0]

print("Potential Buy Signals:")
print(buy_signals)

print("Potential Sell Signals:")
print(sell_signals)
```

This script downloads historical data for the Apple stock, calculates two moving averages (50 days and 200 days), and generates a trading signal based on these averages. When the 50-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average, this could be interpreted as a buy signal, and vice versa.

Please note that this is a very simplistic strategy and should not be used for real trading without further refinement and understanding of the financial markets.
