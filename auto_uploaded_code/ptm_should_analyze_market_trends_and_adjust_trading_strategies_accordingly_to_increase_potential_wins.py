Sure, here is a simple example of how you might start building a Python trading bot that uses market trends to adjust its trading strategy. This bot uses the pandas library to analyze market data and the yfinance library to fetch real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading bots require a lot more complexity and safeguards to be effective and safe to use.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

class TradingBot:
    def __init__(self, symbol):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.data = self.get_data()

    def get_data(self):
        data = yf.download(self.symbol, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')
        return data

    def analyze_trends(self):
        # Calculate moving averages
        self.data['MA10'] = self.data['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
        self.data['MA50'] = self.data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

        # Create a column 'Shares' where we will store our trading strategy
        self.data['Shares'] = [1 if self.data.loc[ei, 'MA10']>self.data.loc[ei, 'MA50'] else 0 for ei in self.data.index]

    def implement_strategy(self):
        # The strategy is to buy when the 10-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average
        self.data['Close1'] = self.data['Close'].shift(-1)
        self.data['Profit'] = [self.data.loc[ei, 'Close1'] - self.data.loc[ei, 'Close'] if self.data.loc[ei, 'Shares']==1 else 0 for ei in self.data.index]
        self.data['Profit'].plot()
        plt.axhline(y=0, color='red')

bot = TradingBot('AAPL')
bot.analyze_trends()
bot.implement_strategy()
```

This bot fetches historical data for a given stock symbol, calculates 10-day and 50-day moving averages, and buys the stock whenever the 10-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average. It then calculates the profit from this strategy and plots it.

Again, please note that this is a very basic example and real trading bots require a lot more complexity and safeguards to be effective and safe to use.
