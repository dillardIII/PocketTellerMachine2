Sure, I can provide a simple Python code to simulate a trade. However, please note that this is a very basic example and real trading involves much more complexity and risk.

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, symbol, volume):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.volume = volume

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # Starting balance
        self.portfolio = {}  # Dictionary to hold symbol: volume pairs

    def initiate_trade(self, trade):
        price = random.uniform(10, 100)  # Simulating price with random number
        cost = price * trade.volume

        if cost > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient balance for this trade.")
            return

        self.balance -= cost
        self.portfolio[trade.symbol] = self.portfolio.get(trade.symbol, 0) + trade.volume

        print(f"Trade executed. Bought {trade.volume} of {trade.symbol} at {price}. Current balance: {self.balance}")

# Create PTM and initiate a trade
ptm = PTM()
trade = Trade("AAPL", 10)
ptm.initiate_trade(trade)
```

In this code, we create a `PTM` class to represent the trading system. It has a `balance` to represent the available funds and a `portfolio` to represent the owned stocks. The `initiate_trade` method simulates a trade by generating a random price for the stock, checking if the balance is sufficient, and then updating the balance and portfolio.

The `Trade` class represents a trade, with a `symbol` for the stock symbol and a `volume` for the number of shares to buy.

Finally, we create a `PTM` instance and initiate a trade for 10 shares of AAPL.
