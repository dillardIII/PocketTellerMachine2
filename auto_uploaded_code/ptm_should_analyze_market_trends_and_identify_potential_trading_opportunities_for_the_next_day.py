To complete this task, we would need to use a combination of data analysis and machine learning techniques. Here's a simple example of how we might approach this using Python. We'll use the `pandas` library for data analysis and `yfinance` to download stock data.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms can be extremely complex. Also, this script doesn't actually predict anything, it just analyzes the data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA10'] = data['Close'].rolling(10).mean()
data['MA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(50).mean()

# Create a "signals" dataframe to store potential trading opportunities
signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
signals['signal'] = 0.0

# Generate trading signal based on moving averages
signals['signal'][10:] = np.where(data['MA10'][10:] > data['MA50'][10:], 1.0, 0.0)

# Generate trading orders
signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

# Print potential trading opportunities for the next day
print(signals.tail(1))
```

In this script, we're downloading historical data for a specific ticker symbol (in this case, `AAPL` for Apple Inc.). We then calculate 10-day and 50-day moving averages for the closing prices. 

We generate a trading signal whenever the 10-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average (indicating a potential upward trend). We then generate trading orders based on changes in this signal.

Finally, we print out the potential trading opportunities for the next day. If the `positions` value is `1.0`, this indicates a potential buy order. If it's `-1.0`, this indicates a potential sell order. If it's `0.0`, this indicates no change. 

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and may not be profitable in real-world trading. Always do your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making trading decisions.
