Here is a simple Python code that simulates a basic trading strategy. This strategy is based on moving averages. When the short term average is higher than the long term average, it's a signal to buy. Conversely, when the short term average is lower than the long term average, it's a signal to sell.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    sma = data.rolling(window=window).mean()
    return sma

def calculate_lma(data, window):
    lma = data.rolling(window=window).mean()
    return lma

def implement_strategy(data):
    Buy_Signal, Sell_Signal = [], []

    for i in range(len(data)):
        if sma[i] > lma[i]:
            Buy_Signal.append(data[i])
            Sell_Signal.append(np.nan)
        elif sma[i] < lma[i]:
            Sell_Signal.append(data[i])
            Buy_Signal.append(np.nan)
        else:
            Buy_Signal.append(np.nan)
            Sell_Signal.append(np.nan)

    return Buy_Signal, Sell_Signal

# Fetch the data
df = web.DataReader('AAPL', data_source='yahoo', start='01-01-2020')

# Calculate short term and long term averages
sma = calculate_sma(df['Close'], window=20)
lma = calculate_lma(df['Close'], window=50)

# Implement the strategy
df['Buy_Signal_Price'] = implement_strategy(df['Close'])[0]
df['Sell_Signal_Price'] = implement_strategy(df['Close'])[1]
```

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and doesn't take into account many factors that could influence trading decisions. It's always recommended to use more sophisticated strategies and/or seek advice from financial advisors. Also, this code assumes that you have the `pandas`, `numpy` and `pandas_datareader` libraries installed in your Python environment.
