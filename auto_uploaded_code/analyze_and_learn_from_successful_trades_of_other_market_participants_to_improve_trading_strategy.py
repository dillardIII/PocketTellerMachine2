This task involves machine learning and data analysis, which is a complex process and requires a large amount of data. Here is a simplified example of how you might approach this using Python, pandas for data manipulation, and scikit-learn for machine learning.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load data
# The data should include features like 'volume', 'price' etc. and a target variable 'successful_trade'
# 'successful_trade' should be 1 if the trade was successful and 0 otherwise
data = pd.read_csv('trades.csv')

# Preprocess data
# This step will depend on your data
# You might want to handle missing values, convert categorical variables to numbers, etc.

# Split data into features and target variable
X = data.drop('successful_trade', axis=1)
y = data['successful_trade']

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print('Accuracy:', accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

# Now you can use this model to predict whether a trade will be successful based on its features
# For example:
new_trade = pd.DataFrame({'volume': [1000], 'price': [10]})
print('Prediction for new trade:', model.predict(new_trade))
```

This is a very basic example and might not work well in practice. In reality, predicting market trades is a very complex task and requires sophisticated models, feature engineering, and possibly deep learning.
