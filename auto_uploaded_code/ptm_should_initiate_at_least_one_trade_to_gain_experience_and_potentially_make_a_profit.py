Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade using a fictional stock market API. Please note that this is a simulation and does not represent real trading. 

```python
import requests

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance

    def initiate_trade(self, stock, quantity):
        # Fetch the current price of the stock
        response = requests.get(f"https://fake-stock-market-api.com/{stock}")
        stock_price = response.json()['price']

        # Calculate the total cost of the trade
        total_cost = stock_price * quantity

        # Check if we have enough balance to make the trade
        if total_cost > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient balance to make the trade.")
            return

        # Deduct the cost of the trade from our balance
        self.balance -= total_cost

        print(f"Successfully purchased {quantity} shares of {stock} for {total_cost}. Remaining balance: {self.balance}")

# Create a PTM with a balance of 10000
ptm = PTM(10000)

# Initiate a trade
ptm.initiate_trade('AAPL', 10)
```

In this code, we first create a PTM (which stands for Python Trading Machine) with a balance of 10000. We then call the `initiate_trade` method to purchase 10 shares of 'AAPL'. The `initiate_trade` method fetches the current price of the stock, calculates the total cost of the trade, checks if we have enough balance to make the trade, and if so, deducts the cost of the trade from our balance.
