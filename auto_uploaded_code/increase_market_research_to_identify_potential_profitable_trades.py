To increase market research for identifying potential profitable trades, we can use Python libraries like pandas, yfinance, and matplotlib to fetch stock data, analyze it, and visualize it. Here is a simple Python code snippet that fetches historical data for a specific stock (e.g., Apple Inc.) and calculates its moving averages to identify potential trading opportunities.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading involves much more complex analysis and factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL','2020-01-01','2022-12-31')

# Calculate short-term and long-term moving averages
data['Short_SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['Long_SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Plot closing price and moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='AAPL')
plt.plot(data['Short_SMA'], label='20 Day SMA')
plt.plot(data['Long_SMA'], label='100 Day SMA')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()

# Identify potential trades
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['Short_SMA'] > data['Long_SMA']).astype(int)
changes = data['Buy_Signal'].diff()

trades = data.loc[changes != 0, ['Short_SMA', 'Long_SMA']]
trades['Buy'] = data['Short_SMA'] > data['Long_SMA']

print(trades)
```

This script downloads historical data for Apple Inc. from 2020 to 2022, calculates 20-day and 100-day moving averages, and plots them along with the closing prices. It then identifies potential trades based on the crossover of the short-term and long-term moving averages (a basic trading strategy). When the short-term average is above the long-term average, it's a buy signal, and vice versa.

Please note that this script is a very basic example and does not take into account many factors that should be considered in real trading, such as transaction costs, slippage, risk management, etc. Always do thorough research and consider seeking advice from financial advisors before making trading decisions.
