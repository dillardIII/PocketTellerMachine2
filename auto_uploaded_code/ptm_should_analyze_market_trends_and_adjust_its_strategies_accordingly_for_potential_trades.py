To create a Python program that analyzes market trends and adjusts its strategies accordingly for potential trades, we would need to use a combination of data analysis libraries like pandas for handling data, numpy for numerical computations, and matplotlib for visualizations. We would also need to use an API to fetch market data.

Please note that this is a simplified version of what you're asking for. In reality, trading algorithms are much more complex and require a deep understanding of both programming and financial markets.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from alpha_vantage.timeseries import TimeSeries

# Alpha Vantage API key
API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# Function to get market data
def get_market_data(symbol):
    ts = TimeSeries(key=API_KEY, output_format='pandas')
    data, meta_data = ts.get_intraday(symbol=symbol, interval='1min', outputsize='full')
    return data

# Function to calculate moving average
def calculate_moving_average(data, window):
    return data['4. close'].rolling(window=window).mean()

# Function to create trading strategy
def create_strategy(data):
    # Calculate short and long moving averages
    short_mavg = calculate_moving_average(data, window=20)
    long_mavg = calculate_moving_average(data, window=100)

    # Create signals
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0
    signals['short_mavg'] = short_mavg
    signals['long_mavg'] = long_mavg

    # Create signal
    signals['signal'][short_mavg > long_mavg] = 1.0

    # Generate trading orders
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Get market data
data = get_market_data('GOOGL')

# Create strategy
signals = create_strategy(data)

# Plot strategy
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 10))
plt.plot(data['4. close'], label='Close Price')
plt.plot(signals['short_mavg'], label='Short Moving Average')
plt.plot(signals['long_mavg'], label='Long Moving Average')
plt.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == 1.0].index, signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == 1.0], '^', markersize=10, color='g', label='buy')
plt.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == -1.0].index, signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == -1.0], 'v', markersize=10, color='r', label='sell')
plt.title('Google Stock Price with Trading Strategy')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

This script fetches the market data for Google (GOOGL) using the Alpha Vantage API, calculates the short and long moving averages, generates trading signals based on these moving averages, and plots the results. The green arrows represent buy signals and the red arrows represent sell signals.

Please replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key from Alpha Vantage. If you don't have one, you can get it for free on the Alpha Vantage website.

Remember, this is a very basic trading strategy and should not be used for actual trading without further improvements and testing.
