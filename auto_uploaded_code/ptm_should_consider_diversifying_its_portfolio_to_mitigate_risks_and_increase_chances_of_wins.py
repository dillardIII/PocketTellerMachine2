Sure, I can help with that. However, it's important to note that Python code can't make investment decisions. It can only help in analyzing data and providing insights. Here's an example of how you can analyze the diversification of a portfolio using Python.

First, you need to install the necessary libraries. You can do this by running the following commands in your Python environment:

```python
pip install pandas
pip install yfinance
pip install matplotlib
```

Then, you can use the following code to analyze the diversification of a portfolio:

```python

import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the stocks in the portfolio
stocks = ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'FB']

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download(stocks, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')['Adj Close']

# Calculate daily returns
returns = data.pct_change()

# Calculate mean daily return and covariance of daily returns
mean_daily_returns = returns.mean()
cov_matrix = returns.cov()

# Set array holding portfolio weights of each stock
weights = np.asarray([0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2])

# Calculate the expected portfolio performance
portfolio_return = round(np.sum(mean_daily_returns * weights) * 252,2)
portfolio_std_dev = round(np.sqrt(np.dot(weights.T,np.dot(cov_matrix, weights))) * np.sqrt(252),2)

print('Portfolio expected annualised return is {} and volatility is {}'.format(portfolio_return, portfolio_std_dev))

# Plotting the data
returns.plot(title='Daily Returns of Stocks in Portfolio')
plt.show()
```

This code will download the historical data for the stocks in the portfolio, calculate the daily returns, and then calculate the expected portfolio performance based on the weights of each stock in the portfolio. It will also plot the daily returns of the stocks in the portfolio.

Please replace the stock symbols and weights according to your portfolio. This is a simple example and does not take into account many factors that could influence investment decisions, such as transaction costs, tax considerations, or the specific financial situation and risk tolerance of the investor. Always consult with a qualified professional or your own independent financial advisor before making personal investment decisions.
