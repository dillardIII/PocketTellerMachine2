Improving risk management strategies involves various factors such as setting stop losses, diversifying the portfolio, and using only a certain percentage of capital per trade. Here is a simple Python code that could help in managing risk:

```python
class RiskManagement:

    def __init__(self, capital, risk_per_trade):
        self.capital = capital
        self.risk_per_trade = risk_per_trade

    def calculate_position_size(self, entry_price, stop_loss):
        risk_amount = self.capital * self.risk_per_trade
        position_size = risk_amount / abs(entry_price - stop_loss)
        return position_size

    def diversify_portfolio(self, num_of_stocks):
        amount_per_stock = self.capital / num_of_stocks
        return amount_per_stock

    def set_stop_loss(self, entry_price, risk_per_trade):
        stop_loss = entry_price - (entry_price * risk_per_trade)
        return stop_loss

# Initialize risk management with a capital of 10000 and risk per trade of 0.01 (1%)
risk_management = RiskManagement(10000, 0.01)

# Calculate position size
entry_price = 100
stop_loss = 95
print("Position Size: ", risk_management.calculate_position_size(entry_price, stop_loss))

# Diversify portfolio
num_of_stocks = 10
print("Amount per Stock: ", risk_management.diversify_portfolio(num_of_stocks))

# Set stop loss
print("Stop Loss: ", risk_management.set_stop_loss(entry_price, risk_management.risk_per_trade))
```

This code provides a simple risk management strategy. The `calculate_position_size` method calculates the number of shares to buy based on the amount of capital you're willing to risk and the difference between the entry price and stop loss. The `diversify_portfolio` method calculates how much capital to allocate to each stock in a portfolio. The `set_stop_loss` method calculates the stop loss price based on the entry price and risk per trade.

Please note that this is a very basic risk management strategy and may not be suitable for all trading scenarios. It's always recommended to consult with a financial advisor or do thorough research before making any trading decisions.
