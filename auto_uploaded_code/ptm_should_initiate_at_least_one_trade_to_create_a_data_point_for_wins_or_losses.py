Here's a simple Python code that simulates a trade. This code doesn't connect to any real trading platform, it's just a simulation. 

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []
        self.wins = 0
        self.losses = 0

    def initiate_trade(self, trade):
        self.trades.append(trade)

        # Simulate win or loss
        if random.choice([True, False]):
            self.wins += 1
            print(f"Trade {trade.name} won!")
        else:
            self.losses += 1
            print(f"Trade {trade.name} lost!")

    def get_stats(self):
        return {"wins": self.wins, "losses": self.losses}

# Create PTM
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
trade = Trade("Trade1", 100)
ptm.initiate_trade(trade)

# Print stats
print(ptm.get_stats())
```

In this code, we first define a `Trade` class that represents a trade. Then, we define a `PTM` class that represents the trading system. The `PTM` class has a method `initiate_trade` that initiates a trade and randomly determines whether the trade is a win or a loss. The `get_stats` method returns the number of wins and losses.

Please note that in a real trading system, the outcome of a trade would not be determined randomly, but based on the performance of the traded asset. This code is a simplified simulation and does not represent a real trading system.
