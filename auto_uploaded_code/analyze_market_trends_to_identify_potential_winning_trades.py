To analyze market trends, we can use Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download the stock price data, matplotlib for plotting graphs, and numpy for numerical calculations. Here's a simple example of how to analyze market trends for a single stock. 

Please note that this is a basic example and real trading algorithms are much more complex and take many more factors into account.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'
tickerData = yf.Ticker(ticker)
df = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2020-1-1', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
short_rolling = df.rolling(window=20).mean()
long_rolling = df.rolling(window=100).mean()

# Plot closing price, short-term and long-term moving averages 
plt.figure(figsize=(16,9))
plt.plot(df.index, df['Close'])
plt.plot(short_rolling.index, short_rolling['Close'], label='20 days rolling')
plt.plot(long_rolling.index, long_rolling['Close'], label='100 days rolling')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Create signals
signals = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index)
signals['signal'] = 0.0
signals['short_mavg'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=20, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
signals['long_mavg'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=100, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
signals['signal'][20:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][20:] > signals['long_mavg'][20:], 1.0, 0.0)   
signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

# Print potential trades
print(signals[signals['positions'] != 0])
```

In this code, we are downloading the historical price data for Apple's stock. We then calculate the short-term (20 days) and long-term (100 days) moving averages and plot them along with the closing price. 

The trading signals are generated based on the crossover of these moving averages. If the short-term average is above the long-term average, it's a signal to buy, and if it's below, it's a signal to sell. The potential trades are printed at the end.

Please note that this is a very simplistic trading strategy and should not be used for real trading without proper backtesting and risk management.
