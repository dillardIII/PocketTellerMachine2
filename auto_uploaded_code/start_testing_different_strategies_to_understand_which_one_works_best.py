Without knowing the specific trading field you are referring to, it's hard to create accurate Python code for testing different strategies. However, I can provide an example how you would set up a backtesting framework to test different stock trading strategies with Python:

For testing strategies, we will use a library called `bt`. This library is very effective for backtesting trading strategies. 

Example below:

```python
import bt
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as web

# Define the name of the stocks we want to backtest
stocks = ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'TSLA']

# Get the stock data
data = web.DataReader(stocks, data_source='yahoo', start='01-01-2010')['Adj Close']

# Write your strategies here
def first_strategy(data):
    # In this strategy, we simply buy and hold
    s = bt.Strategy('Buy and Hold', [bt.algos.RunOnce(),
                                     bt.algos.SelectAll(),
                                     bt.algos.WeighEqually(),
                                     bt.algos.Rebalance()])
    return s

def second_strategy(data):
    # In this strategy, we sell when the stock price is going down
    s = bt.Strategy('Sell on Down', [bt.algos.WeighTarget(bt.algos.SmaRollDown(5)),
                                     bt.algos.Rebalance()])
    return s

# Create the backtests
test1 = bt.Backtest(first_strategy(data), data)
test2 = bt.Backtest(second_strategy(data), data)

# Run the backtests
results = bt.run(test1, test2)

# Display the results
print(results.display())
```

The above example uses the buy and hold strategy and the moving average strategy to backtest three stocks. It generates a summary of the performances of the strategies.

Note: You would need to install bt by running `pip install bt` in your terminal. Also, the effectiveness of the strategy may vary depending on market conditions and the stocks you are analyzing. Always use real-time trading to confirm if a strategy really works.  

Before running the code, make sure you install the required libraries with:

```shell
pip install pandas pandas-datareader bt
```
