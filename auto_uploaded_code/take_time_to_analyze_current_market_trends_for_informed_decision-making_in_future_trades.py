Since we cannot directly write Python code to analyze market trends (as it requires APIs and huge databases to get the data and analyze it), here we are providing a general structure of how the code should be. Also, the analysis of market trends is subjective and might require knowledge of Machine Learning and Data Analysis.

Here, we use Pandas library for data handling and manipulation, yfinance library to fetch historical market data, and matplotlib library for chart plotting.

Remember to install the necessary libraries by using pip:

pip install yfinance
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib

Detailed Python code:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def analyze_trends(ticker_symbol, period='1y'):
  # Download historical data as dataframe
  data = yf.download(ticker_symbol, period=period)

  # Calculate moving averages
  data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
  data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

  # Plot closing price along with moving averages
  plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
  plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Closing Price', color='blue')
  plt.plot(data['SMA_50'], label='50-Day SMA', color='red')
  plt.plot(data['SMA_200'], label='200-Day SMA', color='green')
  plt.title(f"{ticker_symbol} Trends")
  plt.xlabel("Date")
  plt.ylabel("Price")
  plt.legend()
  plt.grid(True)
  plt.show()

# Analyze trends for the desired ticker symbol (e.g., 'AAPL' for Apple Inc.)
analyze_trends('AAPL')
```

This Python code fetches historical data for the specified ticker symbol, calculates 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (commonly used in trend analysis), and plots the closing prices along with the moving averages. With these plots, one can see the price trends and potentially make better trading decisions. Be aware that this is a very basic form of analysis, and actual trading should incorporate much more sophisticated statistics and strategies.
