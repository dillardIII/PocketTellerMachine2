Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. This code is a basic example and doesn't interact with real markets. In real scenarios, you would need to use a trading API to connect with a broker or exchange.

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, symbol, quantity, trade_type):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.trade_type = trade_type

    def execute_trade(self):
        print(f"Executing {self.trade_type} trade for {self.quantity} of {self.symbol}")

# Create a trade
ptm_trade = Trade("AAPL", 10, "BUY")

# Execute the trade
ptm_trade.execute_trade()
```

In this code, we define a `Trade` class with `symbol` (the stock symbol), `quantity` (the number of shares to trade), and `trade_type` (either "BUY" or "SELL") as attributes. The `execute_trade` method simulates the execution of the trade.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading involves more complexities like price, order types, handling trade responses, error handling, etc. Also, remember that trading involves risks and should be done with caution.
