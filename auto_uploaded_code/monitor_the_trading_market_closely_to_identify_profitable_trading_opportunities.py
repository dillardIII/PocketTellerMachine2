To fulfill this task demands five main steps to it:

1. Connect to the API. Depending on the platform Cole is trading on, you should have the API documentation for this step.
2. Retrieve market data. APIs usually provide methods to fetch historical, live data, or both. This step depends heavily on what type of trading strategy you're running (Long term, short term, etc).
3. Analyze the data. This part involves creating indicators to identify trading opportunities, this could range from simple mathematical operations to complex statistical models.
4. Define your strategy. Here you lay down the conditions that should be met for a buy or a sell action.
5. Execute Trades. Implement a functionality that trades on behalf of you based on the strategy.

Please note that many trading platforms provide Sandbox environments to test your bot, do not start live trading before testing.

Here's a very basic example using the Alpaca API to a fictional moving average crossover strategy (The bot buys when the fast moving average crosses over the slow moving average):

``` python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi
import pandas as pd

api = tradeapi.REST('<your API key>', '<your secret key>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets')

symbol = 'AAPL'
df = api.get_barset(symbol, 'day', limit=50).df[symbol]

df['MA20'] = df['close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
df['MA50'] = df['close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

latest_close = df['close'][-1]
ma20_latest = df['MA20'][-1]
ma50_latest = df['MA50'][-1]

if ma20_latest > ma50_latest:
    api.submit_order(
        symbol=symbol,
        qty=1,
        side='buy',
        type='market',
        time_in_force='gtc'
    )

elif ma20_latest < ma50_latest:
    api.submit_order(
        symbol=symbol,
        qty=1,
        side='sell',
        type='market',
        time_in_force='gtc'
    )
```

This script retrieves the last 50 days of trading data and calculates the 20- and 50-day moving averages. If the 20-day moving average is greater than the 50-day moving average, the script places a market order to buy a share of the stock. If the 50-day moving average is greater, the script places an order to sell.

Remember that this is a very basic example and a real trading bot requires much more logic and safeguards to prevent losses.
