Sure, I can help you with that. However, please note that the actual trading part involves real money and should be done with caution. Here is a simple Python code using a hypothetical trading API:

```python
import random
import trading_api  # This is a hypothetical trading API

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.api = trading_api.connect()  # Connect to the trading API

    def initiate_trade(self):
        # Select a random stock
        stock = random.choice(self.api.get_all_stocks())

        # Buy 1 share of the stock
        self.api.buy(stock, 1)

        print(f"PTM initiated a trade: Bought 1 share of {stock}")

ptm = PTM()
ptm.initiate_trade()
```

This code creates a class `PTM` that connects to the trading API when instantiated. The `initiate_trade` method selects a random stock from all available stocks and buys 1 share of it.

Please replace `trading_api` with the actual trading API you're using. Also, this is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you'd need to handle exceptions, make sure you have enough balance before buying, etc.
