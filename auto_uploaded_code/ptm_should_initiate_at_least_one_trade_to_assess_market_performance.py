Sure, I can provide you with a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. However, please note that in a real-world scenario, trading involves complex systems and requires interaction with a trading API or platform. 

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, ticker, volume):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.volume = volume

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []

    def initiate_trade(self, trade):
        self.trades.append(trade)
        print(f"Trade initiated for {trade.volume} units of {trade.ticker}")

# Create a PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
trade = Trade("AAPL", 100)
ptm.initiate_trade(trade)
```

In this code, we have a `Trade` class that represents a trade with a ticker symbol and volume. The `PTM` class represents a portfolio trading model, which can initiate trades. The `initiate_trade` method of the `PTM` class initiates a trade by adding it to the list of trades and printing a message.

Please replace the "AAPL" and 100 with the stock you want to trade and the volume you want to trade respectively.
