Sure, here is a simple Python code using the `alpaca-trade-api` package to initiate a trade. Please replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your actual Alpaca API key and secret.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Authenticate with Alpaca API
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Define the trade parameters
symbol = 'AAPL'  # Apple Inc.
qty = 1  # Number of shares to buy
side = 'buy'  # 'buy' or 'sell'
type = 'market'  # 'market', 'limit', 'stop', 'stop_limit' or 'trailing_stop'
time_in_force = 'gtc'  # 'day', 'gtc', 'opg' or 'ioc'

# Initiate the trade
order = api.submit_order(
    symbol=symbol,
    qty=qty,
    side=side,
    type=type,
    time_in_force=time_in_force
)

print(f"Submitted {side} order for {qty} shares of {symbol}.")
```

This code initiates a trade to buy 1 share of Apple Inc. at the current market price. The order is a "good till cancelled" (gtc) order, which means it will remain open until it is filled or manually cancelled.

After the trade is initiated, you can gather data and assess the market's response by analyzing the order execution details and subsequent price movements.

Please note that this is a very basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would likely need to implement more sophisticated trading strategies and risk management rules. Also, you should handle potential exceptions that might occur during the trading process.
