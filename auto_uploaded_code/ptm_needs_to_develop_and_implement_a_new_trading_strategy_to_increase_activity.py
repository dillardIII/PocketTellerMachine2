Sure, I can provide a basic example of a Python code that could be used to implement a simple trading strategy. This strategy will be based on a simple moving average (SMA) crossover, which is a common trading strategy. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading strategies would require a lot more complexity, including risk management, position sizing, handling of transaction costs, etc.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    sma = data.rolling(window=window).mean()
    return sma

def trading_strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    # Calculate the short and long window simple moving averages
    data['short_sma'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], short_window)
    data['long_sma'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], long_window)

    # Create signals based on SMA crossover
    data['signal'] = 0.0
    data['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(data['short_sma'][short_window:] > data['long_sma'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

    # Generate trading orders based on signals
    data['positions'] = data['signal'].diff()

    return data

# Define the stock symbol and the data range
symbol = 'AAPL'
start_date = '2010-01-01'
end_date = '2020-12-31'

# Get the stock data
data = web.DataReader(symbol, 'yahoo', start_date, end_date)

# Define the short and long window SMA periods
short_window = 40
long_window = 100

# Apply the trading strategy
trading_data = trading_strategy(data, short_window, long_window)

# Print the trading data
print(trading_data)
```

This script fetches historical data for a specific stock symbol (in this case, Apple Inc. represented by 'AAPL') from Yahoo Finance. It then calculates the short and long window simple moving averages (SMA) and generates trading signals based on the SMA crossover. When the short SMA is above the long SMA, it generates a buy signal (represented by 1.0), and when the short SMA is below the long SMA, it generates a sell signal (represented by 0.0). The 'positions' column represents the trading orders based on these signals.
