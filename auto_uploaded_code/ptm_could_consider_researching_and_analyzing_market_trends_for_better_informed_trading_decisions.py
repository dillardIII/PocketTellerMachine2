Sure, I can provide a simple Python code that uses pandas library to analyze market trends. However, please note that this is a very basic example and real-world financial analysis requires more complex algorithms and data sources.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as web
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'PTM'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = web.get_data_yahoo(tickerSymbol, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# See the data
print(tickerData)

# Visualize the closing price history
plt.figure(figsize=(16,8))
plt.title('Close Price History')
plt.plot(tickerData['Close'])
plt.xlabel('Date', fontsize=18)
plt.ylabel('Close Price USD ($)', fontsize=18)
plt.show()
```

This code will download PTM's stock data from Yahoo Finance, print it, and plot the closing price history. You can replace 'PTM' with any other ticker symbol to analyze different stocks.

For more sophisticated analysis, you might want to consider using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow to predict future prices, or libraries like statsmodels for statistical analysis. You might also want to use APIs like Alpha Vantage or Quandl to get more comprehensive and accurate financial data.
