Sure, I can help you with that. However, please note that in order to initiate trades, we need to interact with a trading API. Here's a simple example of how you might do this using the Alpaca API, which is a popular choice for algorithmic trading. 

First, you need to install the Alpaca API by running the command `pip install alpaca-trade-api`.

Here is a simple Python script that initiates a few trades:

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up API connection
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Define a list of stocks to trade
stocks_to_trade = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL']

# Initiate a trade for each stock
for stock in stocks_to_trade:
    api.submit_order(
        symbol=stock,
        qty=1,
        side='buy',
        type='market',
        time_in_force='gtc'
    )
```

Please replace `'<APCA-API-KEY-ID>'` and `'<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>'` with your actual Alpaca API key ID and secret key. This script will initiate a market order to buy one share of each stock in the `stocks_to_trade` list.

Please note that this is a very basic example and does not include any error handling or strategy for choosing stocks or order quantities. Also, this example uses Alpaca's paper trading API, which simulates trades but does not actually execute them in the real market. 

Before running this script, make sure you understand how the Alpaca API works and are comfortable with the potential risks of algorithmic trading.
