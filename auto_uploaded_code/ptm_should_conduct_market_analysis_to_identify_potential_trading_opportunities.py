To conduct market analysis, we would need access to market data. For this task, we will use the `yfinance` library in Python which allows us to download stock data from Yahoo Finance. We will analyze the data using the `pandas` library.

Here is a simple Python script that downloads the historical market data for a specific stock, calculates its moving averages, and identifies potential trading opportunities based on the crossover strategy.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'  # Apple Inc.

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# Calculate the short-term/simple moving average
tickerDf['SMA_20'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-term/simple moving average
tickerDf['SMA_50'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a column to hold the trade signals
tickerDf['Signal'] = 0.0

# Generate trading signals based on the crossover strategy
tickerDf['Signal'][20:] = np.where(tickerDf['SMA_20'][20:] > tickerDf['SMA_50'][20:], 1.0, 0.0)

# Generate trading orders based on the signals
tickerDf['Positions'] = tickerDf['Signal'].diff()

# Print the DataFrame
print(tickerDf)
```

This script identifies potential trading opportunities based on the crossover strategy. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it generates a buy signal. Conversely, when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, it generates a sell signal.

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and does not take into account other important factors such as transaction costs, slippage, risk management, etc. Always do your own research before making any trading decisions. 

Also, replace 'AAPL' with the ticker symbol of the stock you want to analyze. The start and end dates can also be adjusted according to your needs.
