To analyze market trends and make informed trading decisions, we would need a lot of data and a complex model. Here is a simplified example of how you might start to approach this problem using Python. This example uses the pandas library to analyze stock data and make trading decisions based on simple moving average (SMA).

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as web
import datetime as dt

# Define the stock to be analyzed
stock = 'AAPL'

# Define the period for which the data will be obtained
start = dt.datetime(2020,1,1)
end = dt.datetime.now()

# Obtain stock data
data = web.DataReader(stock, 'yahoo', start, end)

# Calculate the short-term simple moving average
short_sma = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-term simple moving average
long_sma = data['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create a column to hold the trading signals
data['signal'] = 0.0

# Generate trading signals based on the crossover of the short-term and long-term SMAs
data['signal'][short_sma > long_sma] = 1.0

# Create a column to hold the trading positions
data['position'] = data['signal'].diff()

# Print the data
print(data)
```

This script calculates the short-term (20 days) and long-term (100 days) simple moving averages of the closing prices of a stock. It then generates trading signals based on the crossover of these two SMAs. A buy signal is generated when the short-term SMA crosses above the long-term SMA, and a sell signal is generated when the short-term SMA crosses below the long-term SMA.

Please note that this is a very simple strategy and may not be profitable in real trading. A real trading model would need to consider many other factors and might use more sophisticated machine learning techniques. Also, this script does not actually execute any trades, it just generates trading signals based on historical data. To execute trades, you would need to integrate with a trading platform API.
