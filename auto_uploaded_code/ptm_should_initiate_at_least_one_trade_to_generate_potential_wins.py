Sure, here is a simple example of a Python code that uses a hypothetical trading API to initiate a trade. Please note that this is a very simplified version and real trading algorithms would be much more complex and would take into account various factors like market trends, risk management, etc.

```python
import trading_api  # hypothetical trading API

def initiate_trade():
    # Define the trading parameters
    symbol = 'AAPL'  # Apple Inc.
    quantity = 10  # Buy 10 shares
    action = 'BUY'  # Action is to buy

    # Initiate the trade
    trade = trading_api.place_order(symbol=symbol, quantity=quantity, action=action)

    # Check if the trade was successful
    if trade.status == 'FILLED':
        print(f"Successfully bought {quantity} shares of {symbol}")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to buy shares of {symbol}. Status: {trade.status}")

# Call the function to initiate the trade
initiate_trade()
```
Please replace `trading_api` with the actual trading API you are using. The `place_order` function is also hypothetical and should be replaced with the actual function provided by your trading API. The trading parameters (symbol, quantity, action) are also just examples and should be replaced with the actual parameters you want to use.
