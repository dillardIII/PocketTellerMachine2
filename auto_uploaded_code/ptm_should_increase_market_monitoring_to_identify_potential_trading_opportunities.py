To increase market monitoring, we can use Python libraries such as pandas, yfinance, and matplotlib to fetch real-time market data, analyze it, and visualize it. However, please note that this is a basic example and real-world trading systems are much more complex and require sophisticated algorithms and risk management strategies.

Here is a simple Python script that fetches the latest data for a specific stock (e.g., 'AAPL') and identifies if there is an increase in the closing price compared to the previous day. If there is, it prints a message indicating a potential trading opportunity.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def identify_trading_opportunity(symbol):
    # Download historical market data
    data = yf.download(symbol, period='1d', interval='1m')

    # Calculate the difference in closing prices
    data['PriceDiff'] = data['Close'].shift(-1) - data['Close']

    # If the closing price of the next minute is higher, then it's a potential trading opportunity
    data['Opportunity'] = [1 if x > 0 else 0 for x in data['PriceDiff']]

    # Print potential trading opportunities
    opportunities = data[data['Opportunity'] == 1]
    if not opportunities.empty:
        print(f"Potential trading opportunities for {symbol}:")
        print(opportunities)

# Test the function
identify_trading_opportunity('AAPL')
```

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading opportunities are identified using much more complex strategies and algorithms. Also, trading involves risk and this should not be considered as trading advice.
