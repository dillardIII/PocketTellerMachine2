This task requires a significant amount of data and a complex algorithm to analyze market trends and adjust trading parameters. Here is a simplified example of how you might start to approach this task using Python. 

In this example, we will use the pandas library to analyze data and the yfinance library to get stock market data. We will analyze the trend of a specific stock and adjust a simple trading parameter (buy if the stock has been going up for the past 5 days).

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_trend(data, lookback):
    trend = (data['Close'].shift(-lookback) - data['Close']) / data['Close']
    return trend

def adjust_trading_parameters(data, lookback):
    data['Trend'] = calculate_trend(data, lookback)
    data['Buy'] = data['Trend'] > 0
    return data

# Download historical market data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Adjust trading parameters based on market trend
lookback = 5 # lookback period to calculate trend
adjusted_data = adjust_trading_parameters(data, lookback)

print(adjusted_data)
```

In this code, we first download the historical market data for the Apple stock (AAPL) from 2020 to 2022. We then calculate the trend for each day based on the closing price of the stock for the past 5 days. If the trend is positive (the stock price has been going up), we set the 'Buy' column to True.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors. Also, this code doesn't actually execute any trades, it just analyzes the data and adjusts the trading parameters. You would need to integrate this with a trading platform API to actually execute trades.
