To analyze market trends and identify potential winning trades, we can use Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download the stock price data, and ta to calculate technical indicators which are commonly used to analyze market trends.

Here is a simple Python script that uses the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator to identify potential winning trades. The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms should consider many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import ta

# Download historical data for required stocks
ticker = "AAPL"
tickerData = yf.Ticker(ticker)
df = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# Calculate MACD
df['MACD'], df['signal'], df['histogram'] = ta.trend.macd(df['Close'])

# Create a column 'Buy_Signal' where if MACD > Signal Line then True else False
df['Buy_Signal'] = df['MACD'] > df['signal']

# Print data
print(df)
```

This script will print a data frame where each row represents one trading day for the AAPL stock. The 'Buy_Signal' column will be True on the days where the MACD line is above the signal line, which is commonly considered as a potential buying opportunity.

Please note that this is a very simplified trading strategy and should not be used for real trading without further improvements. The financial market is influenced by many factors and it's impossible to predict its movements with 100% accuracy. Always do your own research before making any investment decisions.
