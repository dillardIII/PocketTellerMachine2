As an AI, I can't conduct a real-time review of current market conditions or adjust trading plans. However, I can provide you with a Python code template that you can use to fetch market data and adjust your trading plan accordingly. You can use APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, etc., to get the market data.

Here's a simple Python code using Alpha Vantage API:

```python
import requests
import json

def get_market_data(symbol):
    api_key = 'YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY'
    base_url = 'https://www.alphavantage.co/query?'
    function = 'TIME_SERIES_DAILY'
    datatype = 'json'

    final_url = f'{base_url}function={function}&symbol={symbol}&apikey={api_key}&datatype={datatype}'

    response = requests.get(final_url)
    data = response.json()

    return data

def adjust_trading_plan(data):
    # Here you can add your logic to adjust your trading plan based on the fetched market data
    pass

symbol = 'MSFT'  # Microsoft stock
data = get_market_data(symbol)
adjust_trading_plan(data)
```

Please replace `'YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY'` with your actual Alpha Vantage API key. Also, note that the `adjust_trading_plan` function is a placeholder where you can add your logic to adjust your trading plan based on the fetched market data.

Remember, trading in the stock market involves risk, and you should make your decisions carefully.
