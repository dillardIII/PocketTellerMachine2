In order to analyze market trends and adjust trading strategies, we would need historical market data and a way to predict future trends. Here is a very simple example of how you might start to approach this problem using Python, pandas for data manipulation, and sklearn for simple linear regression.

Please note that this is a simplified example and actual market prediction would require a much more complex model, possibly involving machine learning algorithms, time series analysis, and a lot more data preprocessing.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Assuming you have market data in a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Let's assume 'Close' column is our target variable
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df.Date,format='%Y-%m-%d')
df.index = df['Date']

data = df.sort_index(ascending=True, axis=0)
new_data = pd.DataFrame(index=range(0,len(df)),columns=['Date', 'Close'])

for i in range(0,len(data)):
    new_data['Date'][i] = data['Date'][i]
    new_data['Close'][i] = data['Close'][i]

# Split the data into training set and test set
train, test = train_test_split(new_data, test_size=0.2)

x_train = train.drop('Close', axis=1)
y_train = train['Close']
x_test = test.drop('Close', axis=1)
y_test = test['Close']

# Use linear regression for trend analysis
regressor = LinearRegression()  
regressor.fit(x_train, y_train) # Training the algorithm

# To retrieve the intercept and slope:
print(regressor.intercept_)
print(regressor.coef_)

# Now we have a model that can predict the 'Close' value of our market data
y_pred = regressor.predict(x_test)

# Compare actual output values with predicted values
df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test, 'Predicted': y_pred})
print(df)

# If 'Predicted' is higher than 'Actual', it might be a good idea to buy. 
# If 'Predicted' is lower than 'Actual', it might be a good idea to sell.
```

Remember, this is a very simple example and the stock market is influenced by a huge number of factors, so a real trading algorithm would be much more complex and would need to consider many more factors.
