Sure, I can give a basic Python script, however please note few points:
- Actual trading requires interfacing with a brokerage or an exchange, which is more complex and often uses proprietary APIs, which I cannot provide.
- These sample might only be useful for educational purposes.
- Executing actual trades requires careful analysis and risk management.
- You should never execute trades without understanding the protocols and potential risks.

Here's a simple simulation of a trading strategy:

```python
# Dependencies
import random

# Trading Strategies
def random_trading_strategy():
    """Example of a purely random trading strategy; for illustrative purposes DON'T ACTUALLY USE"""
    return random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])

def trade(asset, action, portfolio):
    """Simulates a trade: buying decreases cash reserves, selling increases them; for illustrative purposes DON'T ACTUALLY USE"""
    if action == 'buy':
        portfolio['cash'] -= asset['price']
        portfolio['assets'].append(asset)
    elif action == 'sell':
        portfolio['cash'] += asset['price']
        portfolio['assets'].remove(asset)
    return portfolio

# Assets
stocks = [{'name': 'stock_'+str(i), 'price': random.randint(50, 200)} for i in range(10)]

# Individual portfolio
portfolio = {'cash': 10000, 'assets': []}

# Start trading
for stock in stocks:
    action = random_trading_strategy() 
    if action == 'buy' and portfolio['cash'] >= stock['price']:
        portfolio = trade(stock, action, portfolio)
    elif action == 'sell' and stock in portfolio['assets']:
        portfolio = trade(stock, action, portfolio)
        
print(f"Portfolio at end of trading day: {portfolio}")
```
This Python script (for simulation purposes only) generates random buys or sells for a list of stocks and keeps track of a hypothetical portfolio's changes throughout the trading day.

Trading decisions based on non-random strategy will require market data, a trading strategy algorithm and possibly machine learning models. Real word trading platforms make trades using a broker's APIs rather than using a script like this, internet latency can dramatically impact trading performance.
