Sure, I can provide a simple example of how you might analyze market trends using Python. In this case, I'm going to use the pandas library to analyze data, and yfinance to download stock price data.

Please note that this is a very basic example. Real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take many more factors into account.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical market data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2021-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['MA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Define a signal (buy when the 50-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average)
data['Buy_Signal'] = data['MA_50'] > data['MA_200']

# Print data
print(data)

# Adjust trading parameters
trading_parameters = {
    'buy_threshold': 0.05,  # Buy when the 50-day MA is 5% above the 200-day MA
    'sell_threshold': 0.05  # Sell when the 50-day MA is 5% below the 200-day MA
}

data['Adjusted_Buy_Signal'] = (data['MA_50'] - data['MA_200']) / data['MA_200'] > trading_parameters['buy_threshold']
data['Adjusted_Sell_Signal'] = (data['MA_50'] - data['MA_200']) / data['MA_200'] < -trading_parameters['sell_threshold']

# Print adjusted signals
print(data[['Adjusted_Buy_Signal', 'Adjusted_Sell_Signal']])
```

This script downloads historical price data for Apple (AAPL), calculates 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and generates buy signals when the 50-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average. It then adjusts these signals based on a threshold. If the 50-day moving average is more than 5% above the 200-day moving average, it generates a buy signal. If it's more than 5% below, it generates a sell signal.

Please note that this is a very simplistic trading strategy and is unlikely to be profitable in the real world. It's just an example of how you might begin to analyze market trends and adjust trading parameters accordingly.
