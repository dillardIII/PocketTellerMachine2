Sure, I can help you write a Python code to track the progress of PTM's wins and losses. However, I need more specific details about the data structure and what exactly you want to track. Here's a simple example of how you might set up a class to track wins and losses:

```python
class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.wins = 0
        self.losses = 0
        self.goal_wins = 10
        self.goal_losses = 5

    def add_win(self):
        self.wins += 1
        self.check_goal()

    def add_loss(self):
        self.losses += 1
        self.check_goal()

    def check_goal(self):
        if self.wins >= self.goal_wins:
            print("Goal achieved for wins!")
        if self.losses >= self.goal_losses:
            print("Goal achieved for losses!")

    def set_goal_wins(self, goal):
        self.goal_wins = goal

    def set_goal_losses(self, goal):
        self.goal_losses = goal

    def get_progress(self):
        return {"wins": self.wins, "losses": self.losses}

# Usage
ptm = PTM()
ptm.add_win()
ptm.add_loss()
print(ptm.get_progress())
```

In this code, PTM is a class that has methods to add wins and losses, check if the goals for wins and losses have been achieved, set new goals, and get the current progress. The goals are initially set to 10 wins and 5 losses, but they can be changed with the `set_goal_wins` and `set_goal_losses` methods. The `get_progress` method returns a dictionary with the current number of wins and losses. 

Please provide more details if you want a more specific solution.
