To complete this task, we would need to use a Machine Learning model to analyze market trends and adjust trading algorithms. Here is a simplified example using Python and a library called pandas for data manipulation and sklearn for machine learning.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load market data into a pandas DataFrame
# This data should include features that you believe affect market trends
# For instance, it could include past prices, volumes, etc.
# For this example, let's assume we have a CSV file with this data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# We'll use all columns except 'price' as features
features = data.drop('price', axis=1)

# 'price' column will be our target
target = data['price']

# Split data into training set and test set
features_train, features_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2)

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(features_train, target_train)

# Now we can use this model to predict future prices
# For instance, let's predict the price for the data in our test set
predictions = model.predict(features_test)

# We can also measure the accuracy of our model
accuracy = model.score(features_test, target_test)
print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy * 100}%')

# Now, we can use this model to adjust our trading algorithms
# For instance, if the predicted price is higher than the current price, we might want to buy
# If the predicted price is lower than the current price, we might want to sell
```

This is a very basic example and doesn't take into account many factors that could influence trading decisions. In a real-world scenario, you would likely use a much more complex model and take into account more factors. Also, trading involves significant risk and this code should not be used for real trading without proper knowledge and understanding.
