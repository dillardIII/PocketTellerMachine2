Sure, here's a simple Python code that uses pandas to analyze market trends. In this example, we will use historical stock data from Yahoo Finance. Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and involve additional factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters
register_matplotlib_converters()

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-1-25')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Calculate the moving average
tickerDf['MA_50'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(50).mean()
tickerDf['MA_200'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(200).mean()

# Plot the closing price and moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.grid(True)
plt.plot(tickerDf['Close'],label='Close Price')
plt.plot(tickerDf['MA_50'], label='MA 50 days')
plt.plot(tickerDf['MA_200'], label='MA 200 days')
plt.legend(loc=2)
plt.show()
```

This script will download the historical data for the Apple stock, calculate the 50 and 200 days moving averages and plot them along with the closing price. 

Please note that you need to install yfinance and pandas library to run this script. You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install yfinance pandas matplotlib
```

Also, please be aware that this is a very simple trend analysis and should not be used for real trading decisions. More sophisticated methods take into account many other factors.
