Your request is a bit vague, but I'll assume you want to simulate some trading activity for PTM. Here's a simple Python script that simulates buying and selling stocks using random values:

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stocks_owned = {}
        self.cash = 10000  # starting cash

    def buy_stock(self, stock_name, quantity, price):
        cost = quantity * price
        if cost > self.cash:
            print("Not enough cash to buy", quantity, "of", stock_name)
            return
        self.cash -= cost
        self.stocks_owned[stock_name] = self.stocks_owned.get(stock_name, 0) + quantity
        print("Bought", quantity, "of", stock_name)

    def sell_stock(self, stock_name, quantity, price):
        if quantity > self.stocks_owned.get(stock_name, 0):
            print("Not enough stocks to sell", quantity, "of", stock_name)
            return
        self.stocks_owned[stock_name] -= quantity
        self.cash += quantity * price
        print("Sold", quantity, "of", stock_name)

    def print_status(self):
        print("Cash:", self.cash)
        print("Stocks owned:", self.stocks_owned)


ptm = PTM()

# Simulate trading activity
for _ in range(100):
    stock_name = "Stock" + str(random.randint(1, 10))
    quantity = random.randint(1, 10)
    price = random.randint(1, 100)
    if random.random() < 0.5:
        ptm.buy_stock(stock_name, quantity, price)
    else:
        ptm.sell_stock(stock_name, quantity, price)

ptm.print_status()
```

This script creates a PTM object with some starting cash. It then simulates buying and selling random stocks at random prices. The `buy_stock` and `sell_stock` methods check if the transaction is possible before proceeding. After 100 transactions, it prints the remaining cash and the owned stocks.

Please note that this is a very simple simulation and doesn't take into account many factors that would be present in real trading, such as stock availability, market prices, trading fees, etc.
