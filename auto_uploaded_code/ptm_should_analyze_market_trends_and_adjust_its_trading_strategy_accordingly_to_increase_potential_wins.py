To complete this task, we would need to use machine learning algorithms to analyze market trends and adjust the trading strategy. Here is a simplified example of how we could do this with Python. This example uses a simple moving average strategy and adjusts it based on market trends.

Please note that this is a simplified example and actual trading algorithms can be very complex and require a deep understanding of financial markets.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load market data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Calculate moving averages
data['SMA_20'] = data['price'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['SMA_50'] = data['price'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a column to hold our trading signals
data['signal'] = 0.0

# Generate trading signals based on moving averages
data['signal'][50:] = np.where(data['SMA_20'][50:] > data['SMA_50'][50:], 1.0, 0.0)

# Create a column to hold our positions
data['position'] = data['signal'].diff()

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model with the last 100 data points
model.fit(data['price'].values[-100:].reshape(-1,1), data['position'].values[-100:].reshape(-1,1))

# Predict the position for the next data point
data['predicted_position'] = model.predict(data['price'].values.reshape(-1,1))

# Adjust the trading strategy based on the predicted position
data['adjusted_signal'] = np.where(data['predicted_position'] > 0, 1.0, 0.0)
data['adjusted_position'] = data['adjusted_signal'].diff()

# Save the data
data.to_csv('adjusted_market_data.csv', index=False)
```

This code loads market data from a CSV file, calculates moving averages, generates trading signals based on these moving averages, and then adjusts these signals based on a linear regression model trained on the last 100 data points. The adjusted signals and positions are then saved to a new CSV file.

Please note that this code assumes that the market data is in a CSV file with a column named 'price' that contains the price data. You would need to adjust the code to match the format of your actual data.
