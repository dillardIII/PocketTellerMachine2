To analyze market trends and adjust strategies accordingly, we would need to use machine learning and data analysis libraries in Python such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn. Here is a basic example of how you might set up a simple predictive model using these libraries. 

Please note that this is a simplified example and actual trading algorithms can be extremely complex and require a deep understanding of both programming and financial markets.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load market data
# This is just a placeholder, replace it with your actual data
market_data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Preprocess data
# This will depend on your specific data
# In this example, we assume the data has 'Trend' and 'Value' columns
X = market_data['Trend'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = market_data['Value'].values

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict market trends
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Plot the results
plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color='blue')
plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, color='red')
plt.show()

# Adjust strategy based on predictions
# This is a placeholder, replace it with your actual strategy
if y_pred.mean() > 0:
    print("Market is trending upwards, consider buying")
else:
    print("Market is trending downwards, consider selling")
```

This code loads market data, preprocesses it, splits it into a training set and a testing set, trains a linear regression model on the training set, uses the model to predict market trends on the testing set, and adjusts the trading strategy based on the predictions.
