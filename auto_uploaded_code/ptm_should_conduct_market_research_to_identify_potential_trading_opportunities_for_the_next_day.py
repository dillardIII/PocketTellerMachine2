In order to conduct market research to identify potential trading opportunities, we would need access to a financial market data API. Here is an example of how you might use the Alpha Vantage API to fetch stock data and analyze it for potential trading opportunities.

First, you would need to install the necessary Python library by running the following command:

```python
pip install alpha_vantage
```

Then, you can use the following Python code:

```python
from alpha_vantage.timeseries import TimeSeries
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define your API Key
API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# Initialize the TimeSeries class with your API Key
ts = TimeSeries(key=API_KEY, output_format='pandas')

# Get daily adjusted stock data for a specific company
data, meta_data = ts.get_daily_adjusted(symbol='MSFT', outputsize='full')

# Calculate the difference between the high and low prices for each day
data['difference'] = data['2. high'] - data['3. low']

# Identify days where the difference between the high and low was greater than 5% of the low price
potential_trading_opportunities = data[data['difference'] > (0.05 * data['3. low'])]

print(potential_trading_opportunities)
```

This script fetches daily adjusted stock data for Microsoft (MSFT) and calculates the difference between the high and low prices for each day. It then identifies days where the difference between the high and low was greater than 5% of the low price, which could indicate potential trading opportunities.

Please replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key from Alpha Vantage. If you don't have one, you can get it for free by signing up on their website.

Note: This is a very basic example and real trading algorithms should consider many more factors. Always consult with a financial advisor before making trading decisions.
