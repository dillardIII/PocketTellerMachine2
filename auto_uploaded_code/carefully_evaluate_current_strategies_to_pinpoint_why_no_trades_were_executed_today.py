As your assistant, I don't have access to the APIs or data sources that Cole's trading algorithm uses. However, I can provide some general Python code that might help troubleshooting.

For example, it would include checking the trading conditions, the status of the trading system, and the current market conditions.

Here is an illustrative example. Keep in mind that your actual code would be more complex and specific to your trading strategies and your trading system.

```Python
# this is a mockup example and assuming these defined functions exist

def check_trading_conditions():
    # This function analyzes whether the trading conditions 
    # specified in the strategy were met
    return True

def check_system_status():
    # This function checks whether the trading system is working 
    # properly
    return True

def check_market_conditions():
    # This function checks whether the market condition is 
    # suitable for trading
    return True

def analyze_strategy():
    # Check if the trading conditions were met 
    if not check_trading_conditions():
        return "Trading conditions were not met today."
    
    # Check if the trading system is functioning well
    if not check_system_status():
        return "There might be an issue with the trading system."

    # Check the current market conditions
    if not check_market_conditions():
        return "The market conditions might not be favorable for trading."

    return "Everything seems fine. Need to check the trading strategy."

# Analyze the strategy and print out the potential issue
print(analyze_strategy())
```

This code provides a simple diagnostic for some reasons trades might not have been executed, but in a real-life scenario, this issue could potentially stem from more complex conditions. If you are unable to find the issue with the overview provided, you might need to further dig into each of these functions or consult with the strategy's designer for a deeper understanding.
