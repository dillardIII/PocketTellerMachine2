Analyzing market trends and opportunities to identify potential profitable trades involves complex algorithms and requires real-time data which is usually obtained from APIs provided by trading platforms. Here is a simple example of how you might use Python to analyze historical stock data using the pandas library and Yahoo Finance.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms can be extremely complex. Also, this code will not actually execute any trades.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

yf.pdr_override()

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Collect data on this ticker
tickerData = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickerSymbol, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate simple moving average
tickerData['SMA'] = tickerData['Close'].rolling(window=14).mean()

# Calculate the standard deviation
tickerData['STD'] = tickerData['Close'].rolling(window=14).std()

# Calculate the upper Bollinger Band
tickerData['Upper'] = tickerData['SMA'] + (tickerData['STD'] * 2)

# Calculate the lower Bollinger Band
tickerData['Lower'] = tickerData['SMA'] - (tickerData['STD'] * 2)

# Create a function to signal when to buy and sell an asset
def buy_sell(signal):
    Buy = []
    Sell = []
    flag = -1

    for i in range(0, len(signal)):
        if signal['Close'][i] < signal['Lower'][i]:
            Sell.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 1:
                Buy.append(signal['Close'][i])
                flag = 1
            else:
                Buy.append(np.nan)
        elif signal['Close'][i] > signal['Upper'][i]:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 0:
                Sell.append(signal['Close'][i])
                flag = 0
            else:
                Sell.append(np.nan)
        else:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            Sell.append(np.nan)

    return (Buy, Sell)

# Create buy and sell column
tickerData['Buy_Signal_Price'] = buy_sell(tickerData)[0]
tickerData['Sell_Signal_Price'] = buy_sell(tickerData)[1]

# Print the data
print(tickerData)
```

This script uses Bollinger Bands to identify potential trading opportunities. When the price crosses the lower Bollinger Band, it may be a good time to buy. When the price crosses the upper Bollinger Band, it may be a good time to sell.

Remember, this is a very simple strategy and should not be used for real trading without further refinement and testing.
