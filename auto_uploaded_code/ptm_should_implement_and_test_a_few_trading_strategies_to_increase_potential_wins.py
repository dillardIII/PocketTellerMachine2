Sure, I can provide you with a simple example of a trading strategy implemented in Python. We'll use the Moving Average Crossover strategy for this example. This strategy is one of the most commonly used strategies in trading. It's based on the principle that if a short-term moving average of a stock price crosses above a long-term moving average, it's a buy signal, and vice versa.

Here's a simple Python code for this strategy using pandas library:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as web

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
df = web.DataReader(tickerSymbol, 'yahoo', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# Calculate the short-term simple moving average (SMA)
Short_SMA = df.Close.rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-term SMA
Long_SMA = df.Close.rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create a new column in our dataframe to hold the trading signals
df['signal'] = 0.0

# Generate trading signals based on the crossover strategy
df['signal'][20:] = np.where(Short_SMA[20:] > Long_SMA[20:], 1.0, 0.0)

# Create a new column in our dataframe to hold the trading positions
df['position'] = df['signal'].diff()

print(df)
```

This code will print the dataframe with the trading signals and positions. A position of 1.0 means a buy signal, and a position of -1.0 means a sell signal.

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and doesn't take into account transaction costs, slippage, or risk management. It's always recommended to backtest any trading strategy before live trading.

Also, you need to install pandas_datareader library if it's not already installed. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install pandas-datareader
```

Please replace 'AAPL' with the ticker symbol of the stock you want to trade.
