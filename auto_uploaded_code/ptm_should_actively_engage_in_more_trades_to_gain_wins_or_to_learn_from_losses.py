To engage PTM (Python Trading Machine) in more trades, you'll need a Python script that uses a financial library, like yfinance for pulling historical stock data, and a predictive model library, such as sklearn for the prediction. Here is a simplified example of a trading bot:

**Please Note:**
The following example is a simplified and illustrative one. Developing a real-world trading bot requires a deep understanding of financial markets and various trading strategies, as well as ensuring compliance with legal requirements.

```python
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Initialize and train a predictive model
def create_model(data):
    model = RandomForestRegressor()
    model.fit(data[:-1,1:], data[:-1,0])
    return model

# Download historical data
def get_data(stock_name, days=100):
    data = yf.download(stock_name, period=f"{days}d")
    return data

# Make trades based on predicted prices
def trade(stock_name, model):
    data = get_data(stock_name)
    predicted_price = model.predict([data[-1,1:]])
    current_price = data[-1,0]
    if predicted_price > current_price:
        print(f"Buy {stock_name}")
    else:
        print(f"Sell {stock_name}")

# Main function
def main(stocks, model):
    for stock in stocks:
        trade(stock, model)

# Assuming we have data for Apple Stocks
stock_data = get_data('AAPL')

# Create a model using the data
model = create_model(stock_data)

# List of stocks our bot will track
stocks = ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN']

# Engage in trades
main(stocks, model)
```

Remember that stock market is extremely volatile and this simple program must not be used in a real trading environment. Please use it for educational purposes only. Most importantly, it doesn't take into account transaction fees or tax considerations. 

Consider learning more about various indicators like Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and others. Production-ready trading bots also need to account for risk management. 

Lastly, always keep in mind the ethical implications of algorithmic trading and comply with appropriate market regulations.
