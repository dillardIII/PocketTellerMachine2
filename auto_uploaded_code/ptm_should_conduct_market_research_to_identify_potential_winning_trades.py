Sure, here's a simple example of how you might use Python to conduct market research. This example uses the yfinance library to download stock data and pandas to analyze it. 

Please note that identifying potential winning trades involves complex algorithms and deep understanding of the market. This is a very basic example and should not be used for actual trading.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Define the ticker list
tickers_list = ['AAPL', 'WMT', 'IBM', 'MU', 'BA', 'AXP']

# Fetch the data
data = yf.download(tickers_list,'2020-1-1')['Adj Close']

# Print first 5 rows of the data
print(data.head())

# Calculate daily returns
returns = data.pct_change()

# Identify potential winning trades
# Here we're naively assuming that a "winning" trade is simply a stock with a positive return
winning_trades = returns[returns > 0]

# Print first 5 rows of winning trades
print(winning_trades.head())
```

This code will print out the adjusted close prices for each stock in the ticker list, calculate the daily returns, and then print out the returns for days where the return was positive (i.e., the stock price increased).

This is a very simple example and real trading algorithms would be much more complex, taking into account many other factors.
