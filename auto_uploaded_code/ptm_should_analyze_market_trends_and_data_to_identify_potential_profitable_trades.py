To analyze market trends and data to identify potential profitable trades, we can use Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computations, and sklearn for machine learning. Here's a simple example of how you might start building a predictive model. This example uses a linear regression model to predict future prices based on past data.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Assuming you have market data in a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Let's assume 'Close' is the target variable we want to predict
# And 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume' are the features we will use to predict 'Close'
features = ['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume']
target = ['Close']

X = df[features]
y = df[target]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()  
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions using the testing set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Compare actual output values with predicted values
df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test.flatten(), 'Predicted': y_pred.flatten()})
print(df)
```

This is a simple example and might not give the best results. For more accurate predictions, you would need to use more sophisticated models and techniques like time series analysis, ARIMA models, LSTM networks etc. Also, feature engineering plays a crucial role in improving the model performance. 

Please note that trading based on model predictions has its own risks and should be done cautiously.
