Sure, I can provide a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading systems are much more complex and require a lot more information and calculations.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 1000  # initial balance
        self.trades = 0  # number of trades initiated

    def initiate_trade(self):
        # let's assume each trade costs 100
        trade_cost = 100

        if self.balance >= trade_cost:
            self.balance -= trade_cost
            self.trades += 1
            print(f"Trade initiated. Remaining balance: {self.balance}")

            # simulate win or loss
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                # win, get twice the trade cost
                self.balance += trade_cost * 2
                print(f"Trade won. New balance: {self.balance}")
            else:
                print("Trade lost.")

        else:
            print("Not enough balance to initiate trade.")

# create a PTM and initiate a trade
ptm = PTM()
ptm.initiate_trade()
```

This code creates a PTM (which stands for "Proprietary Trading Model") with an initial balance of 1000. It can initiate a trade, which costs 100. After the trade, it randomly decides whether the trade was a win or a loss. If it was a win, the PTM gets twice the trade cost added to its balance. If it was a loss, nothing happens. The PTM can't initiate a trade if it doesn't have enough balance.
