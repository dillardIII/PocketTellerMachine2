As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I can't conduct a review of trading algorithms directly. However, I can provide you with a Python code example that simulates a review process of a simple trading algorithm. You can modify this example to suit your specific needs.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Assuming we have a dataset 'trading_data.csv'
data = pd.read_csv('trading_data.csv')

# Let's say we have features 'Feature1', 'Feature2', ..., 'FeatureN' and target 'Target'
features = ['Feature1', 'Feature2', 'FeatureN']
target = 'Target'

X = data[features]
y = data[target]

# Split data into training and validation data
train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=1)

# Define the model
trading_model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=1)

# Fit the model
trading_model.fit(train_X, train_y)

# Make validation predictions
val_predictions = trading_model.predict(val_X)

# Calculate MAE
mae = mean_absolute_error(val_predictions, val_y)

print("Validation MAE: {:,.0f}".format(mae))

# If MAE is high, the trading algorithm might not be functioning as expected.
```

This script loads a dataset, splits it into training and validation sets, trains a Random Forest model on the training data, makes predictions on the validation data, and then calculates the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the predictions. If the MAE is high, it suggests that the trading algorithm might not be functioning as expected.

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In reality, trading algorithms are complex and may involve multiple models, real-time data, and other factors. The review process would likely involve a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance, as well as a review of the underlying code.
