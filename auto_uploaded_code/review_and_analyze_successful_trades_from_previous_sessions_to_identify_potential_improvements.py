Assuming the historical trade data is stored in a file called "trade_data.csv", here's a simple Python code to load and analyze this data using pandas library.

```python
import pandas as pd

def analyze_successful_trades():

    # Load the trade data into a pandas DataFrame
    df = pd.read_csv('trade_data.csv')

    # Filter for successful trades
    successful_trades = df[df['Status'] == 'Successful']

    # Analyze successful trades
    avg_profit = successful_trades['Profit'].mean()
    max_profit = successful_trades['Profit'].max()
    min_profit = successful_trades['Profit'].min()

    # Identify potential improvements by comparing with overall trades
    overall_avg_profit = df['Profit'].mean()
    improvement = avg_profit - overall_avg_profit
    
    print(f'Average profit of successful trades: {avg_profit}')
    print(f'Maximum profit of successful trades: {max_profit}')
    print(f'Minimum profit of successful trades: {min_profit}')
    print(f'Potential improvements: {improvement}')

analyze_successful_trades()
```

This code assumes that your CSV file has a column 'Status' to indicate whether a trade was successful or not, and a 'Profit' column that indicates the benefit obtained from the trade. If your CSV file structure is different, you would need to adjust the code accordingly. 

The function 'analyze_successful_trades' loads the CSV data, filters for successful trades, and calculates the average, maximum, and minimum profit achieved. It then calculates potential improvements by comparing the average profit from successful trades with the overall average profit. 

Please install pandas library using the command 'pip install pandas' before running the code.
