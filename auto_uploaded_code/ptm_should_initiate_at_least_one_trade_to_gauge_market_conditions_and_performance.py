Sure, here is a simple Python code to initiate a trade using a hypothetical trading API. Please note that this is a simplified example and actual trading involves more complexities like authentication, error handling, real-time data etc.

```python
import requests

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, base_url):
        self.base_url = base_url

    def initiate_trade(self, symbol, quantity, action):
        # Construct the API endpoint
        endpoint = f"{self.base_url}/trade"

        # Construct the data payload
        data = {
            "symbol": symbol,
            "quantity": quantity,
            "action": action
        }

        # Send a POST request to the API endpoint
        response = requests.post(endpoint, json=data)

        # Return the response
        return response.json()

# Initialize PTM with the base URL of the trading API
ptm = PTM("http://example.com/api")

# Initiate a trade
response = ptm.initiate_trade("AAPL", 1, "buy")

# Print the response
print(response)
```

This code creates a `PTM` class that has a method `initiate_trade` which sends a POST request to a hypothetical trading API to initiate a trade. The `initiate_trade` method takes three parameters: `symbol` (the symbol of the stock to trade), `quantity` (the number of shares to trade), and `action` (either "buy" or "sell").

Please replace `"http://example.com/api"` with the actual base URL of your trading API and `"AAPL"` with the actual symbol of the stock you want to trade. Also, you might need to provide authentication details depending on the API you are using.
