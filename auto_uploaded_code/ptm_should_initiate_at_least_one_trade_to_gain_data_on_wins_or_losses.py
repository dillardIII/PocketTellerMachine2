Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade. This code doesn't connect to any real trading platform, it's just a simulation.

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self):
        self.win = 0
        self.loss = 0

    def initiate_trade(self):
        # Simulate a trade, outcome is random
        outcome = random.choice(['win', 'loss'])
        if outcome == 'win':
            self.win += 1
        else:
            self.loss += 1
        return outcome

# Create a PTM (Portfolio Trade Manager)
ptm = Trade()

# Initiate at least one trade
trade_outcome = ptm.initiate_trade()

# Print the outcome
print(f'Trade outcome: {trade_outcome}')
print(f'Wins: {ptm.win}, Losses: {ptm.loss}')
```

This code creates a `Trade` class with methods to initiate a trade and track wins and losses. When a trade is initiated, the outcome is randomly chosen to be either a win or a loss. The `initiate_trade` method updates the win or loss count accordingly. The `Trade` class could be part of a larger Portfolio Trade Manager (PTM) system.

Please note that in a real trading scenario, the trade outcome would be determined by complex factors such as market conditions, trading strategy, etc., not by a random choice. This code is a simplification for illustrative purposes.
