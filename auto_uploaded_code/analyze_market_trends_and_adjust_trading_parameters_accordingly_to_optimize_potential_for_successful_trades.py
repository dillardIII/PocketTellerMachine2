Analyzing market trends and adjusting trading parameters is a complex task that involves machine learning and data analysis. Here's a simplified example of how you might approach this using Python. This example uses a simple moving average strategy and adjusts the lookback period based on market volatility.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world trading systems are much more complex.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load market data
# Assuming 'Close' is the closing price and 'Volume' is the trading volume
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Calculate market volatility
data['Return'] = data['Close'].pct_change()
data['Volatility'] = data['Return'].rolling(window=21).std() * np.sqrt(21)

# Use linear regression to find relationship between volatility and optimal lookback period
X = data['Volatility'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = data['Return'].values.reshape(-1,1)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict optimal lookback period based on current volatility
current_volatility = data['Volatility'].iloc[-1]
predicted_lookback = model.predict(np.array([[current_volatility]]))

# Round to nearest integer and clip at 1
predicted_lookback = int(np.round(predicted_lookback[0][0]))
predicted_lookback = max(predicted_lookback, 1)

# Calculate moving average with predicted lookback period
data['SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=predicted_lookback).mean()

# Generate trading signals based on moving average
data['Signal'] = 0
data.loc[data['Close'] > data['SMA'], 'Signal'] = 1
data.loc[data['Close'] < data['SMA'], 'Signal'] = -1

# Print trading signals
print(data['Signal'])
```

This script loads market data, calculates market volatility, uses linear regression to find the relationship between volatility and the optimal lookback period for a moving average, predicts the optimal lookback period based on current volatility, calculates a moving average with the predicted lookback period, and generates trading signals based on the moving average.

Please note that this script assumes that the market data is stored in a CSV file with 'Close' and 'Volume' columns. You would need to replace 'market_data.csv' with the path to your actual market data file.
