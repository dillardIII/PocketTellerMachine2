Sure, I can provide you with a simple Python code that implements a basic trading strategy. This strategy is called "Moving Average Crossover Strategy". It's a simple strategy where we buy an asset when its short term moving average crosses above its long term moving average, and sell when its short term moving average crosses below its long term moving average.

Here's the Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Collect data on this ticker
df = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickerSymbol, start="2020-01-01", end="2021-12-31")

# Calculate the short-term exponential moving average (EMA)
ShortEMA = df.Close.ewm(span=12, adjust=False).mean()

# Calculate the long-term EMA
LongEMA = df.Close.ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()

# Create signals based on crossover
df['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(ShortEMA > LongEMA, 1, 0)
df['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(ShortEMA < LongEMA, -1, 0)

# Generate trading orders
df['Trade_Orders'] = df['Buy_Signal'] + df['Sell_Signal']

print(df)
```

This code uses Yahoo Finance to fetch historical data for a specific ticker symbol (in this case, 'AAPL' for Apple Inc.). It calculates the short-term and long-term exponential moving averages (EMA) of the closing prices. When the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA, it generates a buy signal (1), and when it crosses below, it generates a sell signal (-1). The 'Trade_Orders' column represents the trading orders based on these signals.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and should not be used for actual trading without proper backtesting and risk management. Also, the choice of ticker symbol, start and end dates, and EMA spans can be modified as per your requirements.
