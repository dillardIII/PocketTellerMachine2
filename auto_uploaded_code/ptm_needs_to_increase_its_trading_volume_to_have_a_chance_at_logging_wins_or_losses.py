To increase the trading volume, we can create a Python function that increases the number of trades made by PTM. However, please note that increasing trading volume doesn't necessarily guarantee wins or losses. It only increases the number of trades, which could result in either wins or losses depending on the market situation and the trading strategy.

Here is a simple Python code snippet that can be used to increase the trading volume:

```python
class PTM:
    def __init__(self, initial_volume):
        self.trading_volume = initial_volume

    def increase_trading_volume(self, increment):
        self.trading_volume += increment
        return self.trading_volume

# Create an instance of PTM with initial trading volume of 100
ptm = PTM(100)

# Increase the trading volume by 50
new_volume = ptm.increase_trading_volume(50)
print(f"New trading volume: {new_volume}")
```

In this code, we define a class `PTM` with an attribute `trading_volume` that represents the current trading volume. The method `increase_trading_volume` increases the trading volume by a given increment.

Please replace the initial volume and increment with the actual values you want to use. Also, this is a very simplified model. In a real-world application, you would need to consider many other factors and probably use more complex algorithms to manage your trades.
