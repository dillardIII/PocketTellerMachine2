To analyze market trends and adjust trading parameters, you would likely need to use some form of machine learning or data analysis. Here's a simple example of how you might start doing this using Python and the pandas library. This example assumes you have a CSV file with market data that includes a 'Close' column for the closing price.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the market data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Use the 'Close' column as the target variable
y = data['Close']

# Use the rest of the data as the features
X = data.drop('Close', axis=1)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the model to make predictions on the testing set
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Print the predictions
print(predictions)
```

This is a very basic example and might not be suitable for your specific needs. For a real-world application, you would likely need to use more advanced techniques and consider more factors. You might also need to adjust the trading parameters based on the predictions made by the model. This could involve setting thresholds for buying and selling based on the predicted market trends.
