In order to improve risk management strategies, we can implement a few techniques such as stop-loss orders, diversification, position sizing, etc. Here is a simple Python code that uses the concept of stop-loss orders. A stop-loss order is designed to limit an investor's loss on a security position.

```python
class RiskManagement:
    def __init__(self, initial_investment, stop_loss_limit):
        self.investment = initial_investment
        self.stop_loss_limit = stop_loss_limit
        self.current_value = initial_investment

    def update_value(self, new_value):
        self.current_value = new_value
        self.check_stop_loss()

    def check_stop_loss(self):
        if self.current_value < self.investment * self.stop_loss_limit:
            self.sell_all()

    def sell_all(self):
        print("Stop loss limit reached. Sell all stocks.")
        self.investment = 0

# Example usage:
risk_management = RiskManagement(initial_investment=10000, stop_loss_limit=0.9)
risk_management.update_value(8500)  # This will trigger the stop loss
```

In this example, if the value of the investment drops to 90% (or less) of the initial investment, all stocks are sold to prevent further losses. This is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms would be much more complex, taking into account many more factors and using more sophisticated risk management strategies.

Please note that this code is a simple demonstration and does not actually perform any real trading. It's important to thoroughly backtest any trading strategy before live trading.
