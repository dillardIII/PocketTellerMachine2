To analyze market trends and opportunities, we would need to use some kind of market data. For this example, let's use Yahoo Finance data. We'll use the `yfinance` library to download the data and `pandas` to analyze it. We'll also use `matplotlib` to visualize the data.

Here's a simple example of how you might identify potential trades based on moving averages:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = "AAPL"
tickerData = yf.Ticker(ticker)
df = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
short_rolling = df.Close.rolling(window=20).mean()
long_rolling = df.Close.rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create signals
signals = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index)
signals['signal'] = 0.0
signals['short_mavg'] = short_rolling
signals['long_mavg'] = long_rolling
signals['signal'][short_rolling > long_rolling] = 1.0

# Generate trading orders
signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

# Plot data
fig = plt.figure()
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111, ylabel='Price in $')
df.Close.plot(ax=ax1, color='r', lw=2.)
signals[['short_mavg', 'long_mavg']].plot(ax=ax1, lw=2.)

# Plot the buy signals
ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == 1.0].index, 
         signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == 1.0],
         '^', markersize=10, color='m')

# Plot the sell signals
ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == -1.0].index, 
         signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == -1.0],
         'v', markersize=10, color='k')

plt.show()
```

This code downloads historical data for Apple (AAPL), calculates 20-day and 100-day moving averages, and generates trading signals based on when the short moving average crosses the long moving average. It then plots the price, moving averages, and trading signals.

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and is unlikely to be profitable without additional filters and risk management. Also, you need to install the necessary libraries by using pip install command. 

```python
pip install yfinance pandas matplotlib
```
