In order to analyze market trends and indicators, we need to have access to a source of market data. There are several APIs available for this purpose, such as Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Google Finance. Here is a simple example of how you might use the Alpha Vantage API to analyze market trends for a particular stock.

Please note that this is a simplified example and real trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
from alpha_vantage.timeseries import TimeSeries

ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'  # replace with your own API key

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    return data['close'].rolling(window).mean()

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data['close'].ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def analyze_trends(symbol):
    ts = TimeSeries(key=ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY, output_format='pandas')
    data, _ = ts.get_daily(symbol=symbol, outputsize='full')

    # calculate simple moving average and exponential moving average
    data['sma'] = calculate_sma(data, 14)
    data['ema'] = calculate_ema(data, 14)

    # identify potential trading opportunities
    # buy signal: when the EMA crosses above the SMA
    # sell signal: when the EMA crosses below the SMA
    buy_signals = (data['ema'] > data['sma']) & (data['ema'].shift() < data['sma'].shift())
    sell_signals = (data['ema'] < data['sma']) & (data['ema'].shift() > data['sma'].shift())

    return {
        'buy_signals': data[buy_signals],
        'sell_signals': data[sell_signals],
    }

# analyze trends for Apple stock
trends = analyze_trends('AAPL')

print('Buy signals:')
print(trends['buy_signals'])
print('Sell signals:')
print(trends['sell_signals'])
```

This script uses the Alpha Vantage API to fetch daily price data for a given stock symbol. It then calculates the simple moving average (SMA) and exponential moving average (EMA) for the stock. 

The script identifies potential trading opportunities based on these two indicators. A buy signal is generated when the EMA crosses above the SMA, and a sell signal is generated when the EMA crosses below the SMA. 

This is a very basic trading strategy and should not be used for real trading without further enhancements.
