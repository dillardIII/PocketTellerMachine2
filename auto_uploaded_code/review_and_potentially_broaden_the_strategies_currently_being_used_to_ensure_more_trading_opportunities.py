As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I can provide you with a general idea of how you can improve your trading strategies using Python. However, I don't have access to your current strategies, so I can't review them. Here is an example of how you can broaden your strategies using Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('trading_data.csv')

# Select the target
y = data.Profit

# To keep things simple, we'll use only numerical predictors
X = data.drop(['Profit'], axis=1).select_dtypes(exclude=['object'])

# Divide data into training and validation subsets
X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.8, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Define the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)

# Fit the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get predictions
preds = model.predict(X_valid)

# Calculate MAE
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_valid, preds)
print("Mean Absolute Error: " + str(mae))
```

This is a simple example of a machine learning model that uses a Random Forest to predict profits based on historical trading data. You can add more features to your data and use more complex models to potentially increase the accuracy of your predictions and thus broaden your trading strategies.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world trading models are much more complex and take many more factors into account. Always consult with a financial advisor or a professional before making trading decisions.
