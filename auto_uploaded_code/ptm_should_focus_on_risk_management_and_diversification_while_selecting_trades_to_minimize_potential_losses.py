To integrate risk management and diversification into a trading strategy would be a complex task. You could create a Python program that verifies diversification and quantifies risk, but without a detailed understanding of Cole's trading strategy and the specific metrics he uses to evaluate trades, it wouldn't be meaningful. The strategy applied will heavily depend on the type of assets being traded.

A simple example I can provide below is for a stock portfolio. This Python code runs a basic risk management program that diversifies the portfolio across five assets and calculates the overall portfolio risk.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# List of stocks in portfolio
stocks = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'TSLA']

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download(stocks, start="2022-01-01", end="2023-12-31")['Adj Close']

# Check if there is any null data
if data.isna().sum().sum() > 0:
    data.dropna()

# Calculate daily returns
returns = data.pct_change()

# Equal weighting scheme for each stock in the portfolio
weights = np.array([0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2])

# Calculate the annualized portfolio return (252 trading days in a year)
port_return = np.sum(returns.mean() * weights * 252)

# Calculate the annualized portfolio variance
port_variance = np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(returns.cov() * 252, weights))

# Calculate the annualized portfolio standard deviation (risk)
port_volatility = np.sqrt(port_variance)

print("Expected annual return : "+ str(round(port_return, 2)))
print("Volatility/Risk : "+ str(round(port_volatility, 2)))
```
In this script, we evaluate the performance of the portfolio consisting of Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Tesla. We download the adjusted close price data for these stocks and calculate the returns. Subsequently, we calculate both the portfolio return and the portfolio risk (Standard Deviation). 

Bear in mind that this is a very simplified representation of how one might consider risk and diversification. The scenario in real trading would be much more complex, taking into account many other factors.
