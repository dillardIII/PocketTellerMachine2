To complete this task, we can create a simple simulation where PTM (Presume it's a trading company) participates in the market. We will use Python's random module to simulate the randomness of the market. 

Here's a simple Python code:

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 0

    def participate(self):
        # Simulate the randomness of the market
        market_result = random.choice(['win', 'loss'])

        # If PTM wins, it gains $100
        if market_result == 'win':
            self.balance += 100
        # If PTM loses, it loses $100
        else:
            self.balance -= 100

        return market_result

# Create a PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# PTM participates in the market 100 times
for _ in range(100):
    result = ptm.participate()
    print(f"PTM has {result} this round.")

print(f"PTM's final balance is: {ptm.balance}")
```

In this code, PTM participates in the market 100 times. Each time, it either wins or loses $100, which is added or subtracted from its balance. The final balance is printed at the end.

Please note that this is a very simplified simulation and does not reflect the complexities of real-world trading.
