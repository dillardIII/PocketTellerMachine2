Your task is a bit vague, but I'll assume that you want to simulate some trading activity for PTM. Here's a simple Python script that uses a random number generator to simulate buying and selling stocks.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stocks = 0
        self.cash = 10000

    def buy(self, price):
        if self.cash >= price:
            self.stocks += 1
            self.cash -= price
            print(f'PTM bought a stock for ${price}. Remaining cash: ${self.cash}')

    def sell(self, price):
        if self.stocks > 0:
            self.stocks -= 1
            self.cash += price
            print(f'PTM sold a stock for ${price}. Remaining cash: ${self.cash}')

    def trade(self):
        for _ in range(100):
            price = random.randint(50, 150)
            action = random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])
            if action == 'buy':
                self.buy(price)
            else:
                self.sell(price)

ptm = PTM()
ptm.trade()
```

In this script, PTM starts with $10,000 and no stocks. It then makes 100 trades, randomly choosing to buy or sell a stock at a random price between $50 and $150. If PTM tries to buy a stock but doesn't have enough cash, or tries to sell a stock but doesn't have any, nothing happens. After each trade, PTM prints out what it did and how much cash it has left.

Please note that this is a very simplistic simulation and doesn't take into account many factors that would be important in real trading, such as transaction fees, market trends, or strategic decision-making.
