Here is a simple Python code that uses the Alpaca API to initiate a trade. This code will buy 1 share of Apple stock. Please note that you need to replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your actual API keys.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code will initiate a trade, but it won't provide any insights on market trends and performance. For that, you would need to analyze historical price data, which is a more complex task. 

Please note that trading involves risk, and this code is oversimplified. In a real-world application, you would need to add error handling, ensure you have enough buying power for the trade, handle the case where the market is closed, and so on.
