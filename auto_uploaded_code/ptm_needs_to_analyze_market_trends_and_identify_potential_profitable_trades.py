To analyze market trends and identify potential profitable trades, we need to use some kind of data analysis. Here, we will use Python's pandas library to analyze the data and matplotlib to visualize it. We will also use yfinance library to fetch the historical market data.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading involves much more complex algorithms and risk management. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Fetch historical market data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA10'] = data['Close'].rolling(10).mean()
data['MA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(50).mean()

# Identify potential profitable trades
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['MA10'] > data['MA50']) & (data['MA10'].shift(1) < data['MA50'].shift(1))
data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['MA10'] < data['MA50']) & (data['MA10'].shift(1) > data['MA50'].shift(1))

# Plot the data along with the buy and sell signals
plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price', color='blue', alpha=0.35)
plt.plot(data['MA10'], label='MA10', color='red', alpha=0.35)
plt.plot(data['MA50'], label='MA50', color='green', alpha=0.35)
plt.scatter(data.index, data[data['Buy_Signal']].Close, color='green', marker='^', alpha=1)
plt.scatter(data.index, data[data['Sell_Signal']].Close, color='red', marker='v', alpha=1)
plt.title('Apple Close Price History Buy / Sell Signals')
plt.xlabel('Jan. 01, 2020 - Dec. 31, 2022')
plt.ylabel('Close Price USD ($)')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```

This script will download the historical data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from 2020 to 2022. It calculates the 10-day and 50-day moving averages and identifies the points where the 10-day moving average crosses the 50-day moving average. These points are potential buy and sell signals. Finally, it plots the close price, moving averages and buy/sell signals.
