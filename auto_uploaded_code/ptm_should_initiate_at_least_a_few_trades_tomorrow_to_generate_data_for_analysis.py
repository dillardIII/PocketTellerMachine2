To initiate trades, we need to have a trading algorithm. Here is a simple example of a trading algorithm using Python. This algorithm will initiate trades based on simple moving average (SMA) strategy. 

Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define the stock to trade
stock = 'AAPL'

# Define the period for the simple moving average
sma_period = 20

# Define the start and end date for the data
end_date = datetime.now()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=sma_period*2)

# Download the stock data
data = yf.download(stock, start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Calculate the simple moving average
data['SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(sma_period).mean()

# Create a column to hold the trading signals
data['Signal'] = 0.0

# Generate trading signals based on the SMA strategy
data['Signal'][sma_period:] = np.where(data['Close'][sma_period:] > data['SMA'][sma_period:], 1.0, 0.0)

# Generate trading orders based on the signals
data['Order'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Print the data
print(data)

# Initiate trades based on the orders
for i in range(len(data)):
    if data['Order'][i] == 1.0:
        print('Buy', data['Close'][i], 'on', data.index[i])
    elif data['Order'][i] == -1.0:
        print('Sell', data['Close'][i], 'on', data.index[i])
```

This script will print out the trading signals and orders for the specified stock based on the SMA strategy. It will print 'Buy' when the closing price is above the SMA and 'Sell' when it's below.

Please note that this is a very simple trading algorithm and should not be used for actual trading without further improvements and testing.
