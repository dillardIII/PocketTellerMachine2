Sure, here's a simple Python code to initiate a trade using a hypothetical trading API. Please note that this is a basic example and doesn't include any specific trading strategies. You would need to replace 'api_key' and 'api_secret' with your actual API credentials.

```python
import requests

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, api_key, api_secret):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.api_secret = api_secret
        self.base_url = "https://api.tradingplatform.com"  # replace with your trading platform's API URL

    def initiate_trade(self, symbol, qty, side, type, time_in_force):
        url = f"{self.base_url}/orders"
        headers = {
            "APCA-API-KEY-ID": self.api_key,
            "APCA-API-SECRET-KEY": self.api_secret
        }
        data = {
            "symbol": symbol,
            "qty": qty,
            "side": side,
            "type": type,
            "time_in_force": time_in_force
        }
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
        return response.json()

# Initialize PTM
ptm = PTM('api_key', 'api_secret')

# Initiate a trade
trade_data = ptm.initiate_trade('AAPL', 1, 'buy', 'market', 'gtc')

# Print the response
print(trade_data)
```

In this example, we're initiating a market order to buy 1 share of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The order is 'good till canceled' (gtc), meaning it will stay open until it's either filled or manually canceled.

Please note that in a real-world application, you would need to handle potential errors, such as network issues or insufficient funds, and you would likely want to implement more complex trading strategies.
