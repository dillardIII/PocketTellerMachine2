Analyzing market trends and making predictions involves complex machine learning algorithms. Here's a simplified example using Python and a machine learning library called `sklearn`. This example uses a linear regression model to predict future stock prices based on past prices.

Please note that this is a simplified model and actual market predictions would require a more complex model and more data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Assuming we have a CSV file 'stock_data.csv' with 'Date' and 'Price' columns
df = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv')

# Convert Date column to datetime
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Convert datetime to numerical for regression model
df['Date'] = df['Date'].map(dt.datetime.toordinal)

# Define features (X) and target (y)
X = df['Date'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = df['Price'].values.reshape(-1,1)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()  
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Compare actual output values with predicted values
df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test.flatten(), 'Predicted': y_pred.flatten()})
print(df)

# Predicting tomorrow's price
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
tomorrow = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1)
tomorrow = np.array([[tomorrow.toordinal()]])
predicted_price = model.predict(tomorrow)
print("Predicted price for tomorrow: ", predicted_price)
```

This code will print the actual and predicted prices for the test set, and then print the predicted price for tomorrow. Remember, this is a simple linear regression model and may not give accurate predictions for stock prices, as stock prices are influenced by numerous factors and can be highly volatile.
