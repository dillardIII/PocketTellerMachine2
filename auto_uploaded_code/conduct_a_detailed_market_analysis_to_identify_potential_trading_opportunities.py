In order to perform a detailed market analysis, we need to have access to a financial data source. In this case, we will use the `yfinance` library, which allows us to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance.

Here is a simple Python code that uses `yfinance` to download the last 5 years of daily data for the S&P 500 Index and calculates the simple moving average for the last 50 and 200 days. These are common technical indicators used to identify potential trading opportunities.

Please note that this is a very basic analysis and real trading strategies should consider many other factors.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Download historical data
data = yf.download('^GSPC', start='2016-01-01', end='2021-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Define a signal
data['Signal'] = 0.0  
data['Signal'][data['SMA_50'] > data['SMA_200']] = 1.0

# Generate trading orders
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Print data
print(data)

```

In this code, a buy signal is generated when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average (the `Signal` column goes from 0 to 1), and a sell signal is generated when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average (the `Signal` column goes from 1 to 0).

The `Position` column shows the trading orders: a positive value indicates a buy order and a negative value indicates a sell order.

Please note that this is a very simplified trading strategy and should not be used for real trading without further enhancements.
