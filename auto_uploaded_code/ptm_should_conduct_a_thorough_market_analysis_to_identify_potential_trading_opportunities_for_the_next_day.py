As an AI, I can provide you with a basic example of how you might use Python to conduct market analysis. However, please note that real-world trading involves many factors that can't be fully captured in a simple script. This script uses the `yfinance` library to download stock data, `pandas` to manipulate the data, and `matplotlib` to plot the data:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Calculate the 20 day moving average
tickerDf['20_SMA'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the 50 day moving average
tickerDf['50_SMA'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a function to signal when to buy and sell an asset
def buy_sell(signal):
    Buy = []
    Sell = []
    flag = -1

    for i in range(0, len(signal)):
        if signal['20_SMA'][i] > signal['50_SMA'][i]:
            Sell.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 1:
                Buy.append(signal['Close'][i])
                flag = 1
            else:
                Buy.append(np.nan)
        elif signal['20_SMA'][i] < signal['50_SMA'][i]:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 0:
                Sell.append(signal['Close'][i])
                flag = 0
            else:
                Sell.append(np.nan)
        else:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            Sell.append(np.nan)

    return (Buy, Sell)

# Create buy and sell column
tickerDf['Buy_Signal_Price'] = buy_sell(tickerDf)[0]
tickerDf['Sell_Signal_Price'] = buy_sell(tickerDf)[1]

# Visually show the stock buy and sell signals
plt.figure(figsize=(12.2, 4.5))
plt.plot(tickerDf['Close'], label='Close Price', alpha=0.35)
plt.plot(tickerDf['20_SMA'], label='20_SMA', alpha=0.35)
plt.plot(tickerDf['50_SMA'], label='50_SMA', alpha=0.35)
plt.scatter(tickerDf.index, tickerDf['Buy_Signal_Price'], color='green', label='Buy Signal', marker='^', alpha=1)
plt.scatter(tickerDf.index, tickerDf['Sell_Signal_Price'], color='red', label='Sell Signal', marker='v', alpha=1)
plt.title('Stock Buy / Sell Signals')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Price USD ($)')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```

This script downloads the historical price data for Apple's stock, calculates the 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages, and generates buy signals when the 20-day moving average crosses above the 50-day moving average, and sell signals when the 20-day moving average crosses below the 50-day moving average. It then plots the price data and the buy and sell signals.

Please note that this is a very simple strategy and should not be used for real trading without further refinement and understanding. Always consult with a qualified financial advisor before making trading decisions.
