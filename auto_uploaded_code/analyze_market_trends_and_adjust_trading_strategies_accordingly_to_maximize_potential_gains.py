Analyzing market trends and adjusting trading strategies is a complex task that involves machine learning and data analysis. Here is a simplified example of how you might approach this task using Python. This code will use the pandas library to analyze historical stock data and the sklearn library to create a simple predictive model.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Load historical market data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Assume the 'Close' column is the target variable we want to predict
X = data.drop('Close', axis=1)
y = data['Close']

# Split data into training set and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()  
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the model to predict the test dataset
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Compare the actual output values for X_test with the predicted values
df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test, 'Predicted': y_pred})

# If the model is accurate, you can use it to predict future market trends
future_data = pd.read_csv('future_market_data.csv')
future_pred = model.predict(future_data)

# Adjust trading strategies based on the predicted future trends
# This part is highly dependent on your specific trading strategies
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example. Real-world market prediction models would be much more complex, involving more sophisticated machine learning models, feature engineering, and possibly use of additional data sources. Also, predicting stock prices is extremely difficult and risky, and should only be done by experienced professionals.
