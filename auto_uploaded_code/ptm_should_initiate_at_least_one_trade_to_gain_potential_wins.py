Sure, I can provide a simple Python code that simulates a trading operation. This code doesn't connect to any real trading platform, it's just a simulation.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance

    def trade(self, trade_amount):
        if trade_amount > self.balance:
            return "Insufficient balance for the trade"
        
        # Simulate a win or a loss
        win = random.choice([True, False])
        
        if win:
            # Simulate a random win rate between 50% and 100%
            win_rate = random.uniform(0.5, 1)
            win_amount = trade_amount * win_rate
            self.balance += win_amount
            return f"Trade won! New balance: {self.balance}"
        else:
            self.balance -= trade_amount
            return f"Trade lost! New balance: {self.balance}"

# Initialize PTM with a balance of 1000
ptm = PTM(1000)

# PTM initiates a trade with an amount of 100
print(ptm.trade(100))
```

This code creates a PTM class with a balance. The `trade` method simulates a trade by randomly deciding if the trade is a win or a loss. If it's a win, it adds a random amount between 50% and 100% of the trade amount to the balance. If it's a loss, it subtracts the trade amount from the balance. The new balance is then printed out. 

Please note that this is a very simplified version of a trading system, real-world trading systems are much more complex and involve many other factors.
