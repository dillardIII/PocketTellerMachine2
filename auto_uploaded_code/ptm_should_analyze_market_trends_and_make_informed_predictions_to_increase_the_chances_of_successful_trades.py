To complete this task, we will need to use a machine learning model to analyze market trends and make predictions. Here's a simple Python code using pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for data visualization, and sklearn for machine learning.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the market data
df = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Visualize the data
df.plot(x='Date', y='Price', style='o')
plt.title('Date vs Price')
plt.show()

# Prepare the data for training
X = df['Date'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = df['Price'].values.reshape(-1,1)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()  
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Compare the actual output values with the predicted values
df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test.flatten(), 'Predicted': y_pred.flatten()})
print(df)
```

Please note that this is a very basic example of a predictive model. Real-world trading models are much more complex and take many more factors into account. They also use more advanced machine learning models.

Also, please replace 'market_data.csv' with your actual CSV file which should contain at least two columns: 'Date' and 'Price'. The 'Date' column should be in a format that can be converted to a numerical value, such as a timestamp. The 'Price' column should contain the price of the stock or other financial instrument.

This code assumes that the market trends can be captured using a linear regression model, which might not be the case in reality. Financial markets are influenced by a multitude of factors, many of which are not included in this simple model.
