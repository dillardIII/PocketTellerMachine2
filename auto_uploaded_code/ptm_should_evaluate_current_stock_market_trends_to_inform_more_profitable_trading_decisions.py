To evaluate the current stock market trends, we can use Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download the stock data, and matplotlib for data visualization.

However, it is crucial to note that this is a simplistic way of analyzing stock market trends and should not be used for making actual trading decisions. 

Please install the necessary libraries by running these commands in your terminal:
```
pip install pandas yfinance matplotlib
```

Here is a basic Python code snippet that fetches and plots historical data for a specific stock:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol (for example: Google's stock "GOOGL")
ticker = yf.Ticker("GOOGL")
data = ticker.history(period='1y')   # Fetch data from the last one year

# Plot the close prices
data['Close'].plot()
plt.title('Google Stock Prices')
plt.show()
```

With the generated plot, you can observe the trend of the closing prices to get a rough idea of whether the stock has been trending upwards or downwards over the year.

For more comprehensive analysis or prediction, methods like Moving Average, Exponential Moving Average, ARIMA or even machine learning techniques (like LSTM) could be considered based on the nature and amount of data available. 

One must be aware that the stock price of a company is influenced by numerous factors, many of which cannot be accounted for through data analysis. Always consider consulting with a qualified financial advisor before making trading decisions.

We also do not have real-time analysis in this code, for real-time analysis we need to use libraries like ccxt in combination with websocket based real-time data updates. 

Lastly, financial trading especially using automated tools involves significant risks, please use the code responsibly.
