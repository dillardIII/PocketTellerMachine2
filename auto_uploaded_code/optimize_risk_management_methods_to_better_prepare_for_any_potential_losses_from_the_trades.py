Sure, here's an example of a simple risk management system written in Python, using a stop-loss strategy. The example assumes we have critical functions to fetch current price and place trades. The Stop-Loss strategy is a simple and effective risk management technique. It is designed to limit an investor's loss on a trade.

Please note, this is a simplified approach and a real-world application should take many more factors into consideration.

```python
class Trader:
    def __init__(self, symbol, budget):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.budget = budget
        self.position = None
        self.stop_loss = None

    def get_price(self):
        # An API call would typically be used here to get current price
        return fetch_price(symbol)

    def buy(self):
        price = self.get_price()
        self.position = {
            'price': price,
            'quantity': self.budget / price,
        }
        self.stop_loss = price * 0.9  # set stop loss level 10% below buy-in
        place_order(self.symbol, 'BUY', self.position['quantity'])
        print(f"Opened the position of {self.position['quantity']} @ {price}")

    def update(self):
        if self.position:  
            price = self.get_price()
            if price <= self.stop_loss:
                self.sell()

    def sell(self):
        price = self.get_price()
        place_order(self.symbol, 'SELL', self.position['quantity'])
        print(f"Sell Order Executed @ {price} due to Stop Loss Trigger")
        self.position = None

# This could be implemented to run in a loop to continuously update
# something similar to:
# trader = Trader('AAPL', 10000)
# while True:
#     trader.update()
#     time.sleep(60)
```

Assumptions in the code: 

1) 'fetch_price' function gets the current market price of the symbol (security).

2) 'place_order' function to place a trade in the market.

This script consistently checks the current market price ('update' function) and if it is less than or equal to stop loss price, it executes a sell order.

Remember to replace these mock functions with your actual trading API functions. Each trading platform will have its own way of placing trades. The API documentation of your trading platform should provide examples of how you can accomplish this.
