To analyze market trends for potential trading opportunities, we can use the pandas library in Python to analyze data. We also need data from the market. We can use Yahoo Finance to get the data. Here is a simple example of how to do it:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL','2020-01-01','2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['SMA_20'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Plot closing price, short-term and long-term moving averages 
data[['Close','SMA_20','SMA_50']].plot(figsize=(10,5))
plt.grid(True)
plt.title('Historical data with moving averages')
plt.show()

# Define a signal (buy=1 , sell=-1, do nothing=0)
data['Signal'] = 0.0  
data['Signal'][data['SMA_20'] > data['SMA_50']] = 1.0   
data['Signal'][data['SMA_20'] < data['SMA_50']] = -1.0 

# Print data
print(data)
```

This script downloads historical data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance, calculates 20-day and 50-day moving averages, and plots the closing price along with these moving averages. It also generates a trading signal based on the relationship between the short-term and long-term moving averages.

Please note that this is a very simplistic approach and may not yield profitable results. More sophisticated methods involve the use of machine learning algorithms to predict future prices or the identification of specific patterns in the price data.
