Creating trading strategies is a complex task that involves vast knowledge in trading and finance. A common method involves using Python libraries like pandas and yfinance for data manipulation and Technical Analysis Library (TA-Lib) for generating technical indicators, such as Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI).

Here's a basic strategy using the Crossing Moving Averages implemented in Python:

```Python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from ta.trend import SMAIndicator

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

#get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

#get historical prices for this ticker (1 year data)
tickerDF = tickerData.history(period='1y')

# calculate SMA for 50 days and 200 days periods
tickerDF['50_SMA'] = SMAIndicator(tickerDF['Close'], 50).sma_indicator()
tickerDF['200_SMA'] = SMAIndicator(tickerDF['Close'], 200).sma_indicator()

# create a column for trading signals 
tickerDF['signal'] = 0.0  
tickerDF['signal'][50:] = np.where(tickerDF['50_SMA'][50:] > tickerDF['200_SMA'][50:], 1.0, 0.0)   

# generate trading orders based on signals 
tickerDF['position'] = tickerDF['signal'].diff()

# print dataframe
print(tickerDF)
```

It's important to mention this is a rudimentary example and only for educational purposes, the strategy is very simple and may not produce profitable results in real trading scenarios.

Understanding trading strategies and their development should involve financial expertise, thorough software development skills, and in-depth testing procedures for risk assessment.
