As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I can provide you with a general structure of how you can create a Python script to analyze market conditions and predict potential profitable trades. However, please note that this is a complex task that requires specific financial knowledge and data science skills. 

Here's a basic example using pandas for data manipulation and sklearn for machine learning:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Load your market data
# This is a placeholder, replace this with your actual data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Let's assume 'Close' is your target variable
X = data.drop('Close', axis=1)
y = data['Close']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Initialize the Linear Regression Model
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model with the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the 'Close' for the test dataset
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Compare the predictions with the actual 'Close' values
print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions))
print('Mean Squared Error:', metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
print('Root Mean Squared Error:', np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)))

# Predict the 'Close' for tomorrow
# You need to replace 'tomorrow_data' with your actual data for tomorrow
tomorrow_prediction = model.predict(tomorrow_data)

print('Predicted Close for tomorrow:', tomorrow_prediction)
```

This is a very basic example and may not give accurate predictions. For more accurate predictions, you might want to consider using more advanced techniques like Time Series Analysis, ARIMA, LSTM, etc. Also, you might want to use APIs like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance to get real-time and accurate financial data. 

Please note that predicting stock prices is extremely complex and uncertain, it's recommended to use these predictions as a part of your decision-making process, not the sole decision maker.
