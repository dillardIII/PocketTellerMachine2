The Python code below assumes that PTM (Portfolio Trade Management) is a Python class conducting trades by calling the 'initiate_trade' method. The evaluation of the performance is done by calling 'evaluate_performance' method.

```python
class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performed_trades = 0
        self.performance = 0

    def initiate_trade(self):
        # Add your trade logic here
        print("Trade has been initiated!")
        self.performed_trades += 1

    def evaluate_performance(self):
        # Add your performance logic here
        self.performance = self.performed_trades
        print(f"Current performance is: {self.performance}")

# Create a new PTM instance
portfolio = PTM()

# Initiate at least one trade
portfolio.initiate_trade()

# Evaluate performance
portfolio.evaluate_performance()
```

Please replace the placeholder comments with your own logic to initiate a trade and evaluate the performance.
