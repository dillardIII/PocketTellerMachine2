To analyze market trends and conditions, we can use Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download historical market data, and ta (Technical Analysis library) to compute trading indicators. Here's a simple example of how you might set this up:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from ta.trend import SMAIndicator

# Download historical data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA) as an example of a trading indicator
sma = SMAIndicator(data['Close'], window=14)
data['SMA'] = sma.sma_indicator()

# Identify potential trading opportunities
# Buy signal: When the close price crosses above the SMA
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['Close'] > data['SMA'])

# Sell signal: When the close price crosses below the SMA
data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['Close'] < data['SMA'])

# Print data
print(data)
```

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms can be much more complex. They may take into account many different indicators, use machine learning algorithms to predict price movements, and consider other factors such as news events or macroeconomic data.

Also, keep in mind that trading involves risk and this code is provided as an example and should not be used for real trading without proper knowledge and understanding of the financial markets.
