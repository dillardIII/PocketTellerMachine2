Implementing this task would be a complex process, as live trading involves continuous data stream from the stock market, processing this data in real time, making predictions, and performing operations based on these predictions. To simply lay out a basic skeleton for this task, we would need to consider Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download historical market data from Yahoo finance, and perhaps also some machine learning libraries to make predictions.

Below is a very basic skeleton:

NOTE: This is a simplistic approach and should not be used for real trading. For real trading, more sophisticated and safe approaches should be taken.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from time import sleep
from datetime import datetime

def get_data(symbol):
    ticker = yf.Ticker(symbol)
    data = ticker.history(period='1d', interval='1m')  # get 1 day data at 1 minute intervals
    return data

def analyse_data(data):
    # Implement your own analysis function here. This function could use Machine Learning, statistical analysis or
    # simple rule-based analysis to find patterns and trigger buy/sell opportunities.
    
    # For example, you might want to implement something simple like:
    # If the latest close price is higher than the previous close price by a certain percentage, 
    # then it might be a good opportunity to sell.
    
    # Return either "BUY", "SELL" or "HOLD"
    return "HOLD"

def trade(symbol):
    while True:
        now = datetime.now().time()
        start_time = datetime.now().replace(hour=8, minute=30).time()  # Start of trading hours
        end_time = datetime.now().replace(hour=15, minute=30).time()  # End of trading hours (these times are for NYSE)
        if start_time <= now <= end_time:  # During trading hours
            data = get_data(symbol)  # get the current data
            decision = analyse_data(data)  # make a trading decision
            print(f'Current decision for {symbol} is: {decision}')  # print the decision
        else:
            print(f'The market is currently closed. Next decision for {symbol} will be made tomorrow at {start_time}')
        sleep(60*5)  # sleep for 5 minutes
        
trade('AAPL')  # Monitor market data for Apple stocks
```

Remember, this script doesn't actually trade for you. It's just a basic foundation to gather and analyze data. You would want to incorporate an API that can actually perform the trades, as well as more sophisticated analysis algorithms for making the trading decisions. And please beware that trading involves significant risks.
