As a AI model, I will provide a simple example of how Python can be used to analyze stock data and identify possible trading options. This approach involves employing a momentum trading strategy where stocks are bought if they've gone up (in price) during the previous period and sold if they've gone down during the previous period. Please note that this is a simplistic approach and isn't suitable for real-world trading without further enhancements and consideration of other factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as pdr
from datetime import datetime

# Define the time period
start = datetime(2019, 1, 1)
end = datetime.now()

# Download historical stock data
data = pdr.get_data_yahoo('AAPL', start, end)

# Calculate the difference in closing prices
data['Diff'] = data.Close.diff()

# Create signals
data['Buy_Signal'] = data['Diff'].apply(lambda x: 'Buy' if x > 0 else 'Sell')

# Print data
print(data)
```

In this code:

1. We are using the `pandas_datareader` library to download the historical stock data of Apple Inc. from Yahoo Finance.

2. We calculate the difference of the closing prices from one day to another.

3. Based on the difference, we generate a 'Buy' signal if the price has increased from the previous day, and a 'Sell' signal if it has decreased.

Again, I must stress that this is a simple example and real-world stock trading involves much more sophisticated strategies, consideration of other factors (like news, company fundamentals, etc.), and risk management strategies.
