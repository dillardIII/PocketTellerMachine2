Analyzing market trends and opportunities for potential profitable trades requires a comprehensive understanding of financial data analysis. This task can be accomplished using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization, and yfinance to download the stock data.

Here's a simple example of how you might analyze the trend of a single stock (e.g., Apple Inc.):

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol (Apple Inc in this case)
data = yf.download('AAPL','2016-01-01','2021-12-31')

# Calculate the moving average
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Plot closing price, short-term and long-term moving averages 
data[['Close','SMA_50','SMA_200']].plot(figsize=(10,5))
plt.title('Trend Analysis of AAPL')
plt.show()
```

This script downloads the historical price data for Apple Inc. from 2016 to 2021, calculates the short-term (50 days) and long-term (200 days) moving averages, and plots them along with the closing price. 

A potential trading strategy could be to buy when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, and sell when it crosses below. 

Please note that this is a very basic form of analysis and should not be used for actual trading without further enhancements. For a more comprehensive analysis, you might want to consider other factors such as volume, other technical indicators, fundamental analysis, etc. 

Also, keep in mind that past performance is not indicative of future results.
