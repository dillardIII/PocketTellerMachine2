To analyze market trends and identify potential trading opportunities, we can use Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download the stock data, and matplotlib for data visualization. Here is a simple Python code that uses Moving Average strategy to identify potential trading opportunities.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
def download_data(stock, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31'):
    data = yf.download(stock, start, end)
    return data

# Calculate moving averages
def calculate_MA(data, short_window=20, long_window=100):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Short moving average
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Long moving average
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                                > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Plot the data
def plot_data(data, signals):
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111, ylabel='Price in $')
    
    data['Close'].plot(ax=ax1, color='r', lw=2.)
    signals[['short_mavg', 'long_mavg']].plot(ax=ax1, lw=2.)

    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == 1.0].index, 
             signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == 1.0],
             '^', markersize=10, color='m')
             
    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == -1.0].index, 
             signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == -1.0],
             'v', markersize=10, color='k')
             
    plt.show()

# Download the data
data = download_data('AAPL')

# Calculate moving averages and signals
signals = calculate_MA(data)

# Plot the data
plot_data(data, signals)
```

This script downloads the historical data for the desired ticker symbol (in this case, AAPL for Apple Inc.), calculates the short and long moving averages, generates trading signals based on these averages, and plots the data and signals on a graph.

Please note that this is a very simplistic strategy and real-world trading involves many more factors. Always do thorough research and consider multiple strategies before making trading decisions.
