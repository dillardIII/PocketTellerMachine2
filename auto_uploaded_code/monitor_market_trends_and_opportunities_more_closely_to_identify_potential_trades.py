To monitor market trends and opportunities, you would need to use APIs provided by financial institutions or trading platforms. Here is a simple example of how you can use the Alpha Vantage API to monitor market trends in Python. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world applications would require more complex analysis and more data.

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd
from alpha_vantage.timeseries import TimeSeries

def get_market_data(symbol):
    API_KEY = 'YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY'  # replace with your own API key
    ts = TimeSeries(key=API_KEY, output_format='pandas')
    data, meta_data = ts.get_intraday(symbol=symbol,interval='1min', outputsize='full')
    return data['4. close']

def identify_potential_trades(data):
    # This is a very simple strategy that identifies potential trades when the price has increased by more than 1% in the last minute.
    data_pct_change = data.pct_change()
    potential_trades = data_pct_change[data_pct_change > 0.01]
    return potential_trades

def monitor_market(symbol):
    data = get_market_data(symbol)
    potential_trades = identify_potential_trades(data)
    return potential_trades

# Monitor the market for a specific symbol
print(monitor_market('GOOGL'))
```

Please note that this code will not run as it is because you need to replace 'YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY' with your actual Alpha Vantage API key. You can obtain this key by signing up on the Alpha Vantage website.

Also, this is a very simple strategy that identifies potential trades when the price has increased by more than 1% in the last minute. Real-world trading strategies would be much more complex and would take into account many other factors.
