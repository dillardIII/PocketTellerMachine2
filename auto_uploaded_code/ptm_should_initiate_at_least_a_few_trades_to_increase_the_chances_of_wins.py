Sure, I will provide a simple example of a Python code that could be used to initiate trades. Please note that this is a very basic example and doesn't include any real trading strategies or risk management. You should use a proper trading library or platform for real trading.

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, symbol, volume):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.volume = volume

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []

    def initiate_trade(self, symbol, volume):
        trade = Trade(symbol, volume)
        self.trades.append(trade)
        print(f"Trade initiated: {trade.symbol} {trade.volume}")

    def execute_trades(self):
        wins = 0
        for trade in self.trades:
            # Simulate win/loss with a random boolean
            win = random.choice([True, False])
            if win:
                wins += 1
                print(f"Trade won: {trade.symbol} {trade.volume}")
            else:
                print(f"Trade lost: {trade.symbol} {trade.volume}")
        print(f"Total wins: {wins}")

# Create PTM and initiate trades
ptm = PTM()
ptm.initiate_trade("AAPL", 100)
ptm.initiate_trade("GOOG", 200)
ptm.initiate_trade("AMZN", 150)

# Execute trades
ptm.execute_trades()
```

This code creates a PTM (Portfolio Trade Manager) that can initiate and execute trades. The trades are represented by a `Trade` class with a symbol and volume. The `execute_trades` method simulates the execution of the trades and randomly determines whether each trade is a win or a loss.
