As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I'm unable to directly interact with PTM's risk management system. However, I can provide a simple example of how you might enhance a risk management system using Python. This example will use a simple risk assessment model that calculates risk score based on some hypothetical factors.

```python
class RiskManagementSystem:
    def __init__(self, current_system):
        self.system = current_system

    def calculate_risk(self, factor1, factor2, factor3):
        # This is a simple risk calculation model
        # In reality, this could be a complex model based on various factors
        risk_score = factor1 * 0.3 + factor2 * 0.4 + factor3 * 0.3
        return risk_score

    def enhance_system(self, factor1, factor2, factor3):
        risk_score = self.calculate_risk(factor1, factor2, factor3)
        
        # If the risk score is above a certain threshold, take action
        if risk_score > 70:
            self.system.take_action()
        else:
            print("The system is safe.")

# Assume we have a current system
current_system = ...

# Initialize our risk management system
rms = RiskManagementSystem(current_system)

# Enhance the system based on some factors
rms.enhance_system(factor1, factor2, factor3)
```

In this example, `take_action()` could be a method that does something to mitigate the risk, like selling assets, buying insurance, etc. The factors could be anything relevant to your risk, like market volatility, company performance, etc. 

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, enhancing a risk management system could involve complex data analysis and decision-making processes, possibly involving machine learning or other advanced techniques. You would also likely need to work with a risk management professional to determine the appropriate factors and thresholds for your specific situation.
