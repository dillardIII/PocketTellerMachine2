To conduct a market analysis, we need data. We can use the `pandas` library to handle our data and `yfinance` to download stock market data. Here's a simple Python script that downloads the last 5 years of daily data for the S&P 500 index:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('^GSPC', start='2016-01-01', end='2021-12-31')

# Display the data
print(data)
```

This script will print out the Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume for each trading day over the last 5 years.

To identify potential trading opportunities, we would need to implement some sort of strategy. For example, we could look for stocks that have dropped a certain percentage from their 52-week high, as they may be oversold and due for a rebound. Or we could look for stocks that are trading above their 200-day moving average, which is a common bullish signal.

Here's an example of how you might implement the latter strategy:

```python
# Calculate 200-day moving average
data['200_MA'] = data['Adj Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Identify days where the closing price is above the 200-day MA
data['Buy_Signal'] = data['Adj Close'] > data['200_MA']

# Print days where a buy signal was generated
print(data[data['Buy_Signal']])
```

This script will print out all days where the S&P 500 closed above its 200-day moving average, which could be interpreted as a buy signal according to this strategy.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading strategies should take into account many more factors and be thoroughly backtested before being used to trade real money.
