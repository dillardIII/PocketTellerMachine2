Sure, I can provide you with a simple Python script that uses the yfinance library to monitor the market. This script will fetch the latest data for a specific stock and print it out. Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import yfinance as yf

def monitor_stock(symbol):
    stock = yf.Ticker(symbol)
    hist = stock.history(period="1d")
    print(hist)

while True:
    monitor_stock("AAPL")  # Replace with your stock symbol
```

This script will continuously print the latest data for the specified stock. You can replace "AAPL" with the symbol of any stock you want to monitor.

Please note that you need to install the yfinance library before running this script. You can do this by running `pip install yfinance` in your terminal.

Also, keep in mind that this script will run indefinitely. To stop it, you need to manually interrupt it. In a real-world scenario, you'd probably want to add some conditions to stop the script, or to trigger certain actions when specific conditions are met (like a stock reaching a certain price).
