To increase market monitoring, we can use Python libraries such as yfinance to fetch real-time market data. Here's a simple example of how you can do it. This script will monitor the market for a particular stock (in this case, Apple Inc.) and print the current trading price every 5 seconds.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import time

def monitor_stock(symbol):
    while True:
        # Fetch current data
        stock = yf.Ticker(symbol)
        data = stock.history(period="1d")
        
        # Print the latest price
        print(f"Current price of {symbol}: {data['Close'][0]}")
        
        # Wait for 5 seconds
        time.sleep(5)

# Monitor Apple Inc.
monitor_stock("AAPL")
```

Please note that this is a very basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would likely want to monitor multiple stocks, analyze the fetched data to identify trading opportunities (for example, using machine learning algorithms), and perhaps even execute trades automatically.

Also, keep in mind that this script will run indefinitely. Make sure to implement a way to stop it safely. 

Lastly, please be aware that using such scripts might be against the terms of service of some trading platforms. Always make sure to check the rules and regulations of your platform before running such scripts.
