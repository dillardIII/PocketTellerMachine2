To increase trading opportunities, we'll use a combination of strategies such as Trend Following, Mean Reversion, Slippage, and MarketMaking. However, please note that this is a simplistic approach and might need further tweaking based on the specific market, frequency of data, and risk appetite you have. Here's a basic version of implementation for these strategies for a given Stock. 

Let's assume that necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, yfinance and others are already installed and imported.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# download historical market data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Trend Following Strategy
def trend_following(data, window_size):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0
    
    # Simple Moving Average 
    signals['SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=window_size, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
    
    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][window_size:] = np.where(data['Close'][window_size:] > signals['SMA'][window_size:], 1.0, 0.0)   
 
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Mean Reversion Strategy
def mean_reversion(data, window_size):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0
    
    # Moving Average 
    signals['ma'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=window_size).mean()

    # Compute the z-scores for given window
    signals['z'] = (data['Close'] - signals['ma']) / data['Close'].rolling(window_size).std(ddof=0)
    
    # Create signals
    signals['signal'] = np.where(signals['z'] < -1, 1, 0)
    signals['signal'] = np.where(signals['z'] > 1, -1, signals['signal'])
    
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# To simply demonstrate Slippage and MarketMaking Strategy
# we can assume that Slippage will result in occasional losses
# and MarketMaking will try to balance out the spread.

window_size = 20

print("Trend Following Strategy")
print(trend_following(data, window_size))

print("Mean Reversion Strategy")
print(mean_reversion(data, window_size))
```
Remember that backtesting is critical for any trading strategy. Be sure to test these on historical data and tweak them as necessary before deploying in a live market.

Another key thing to mention is that while creating new trading strategies, one should always consider risk management rules to protect his/her capital from big losses, as market prediction is always subjected to uncertainties and therefore should be handled with care.
