Here is a simple Python code that uses pandas and yfinance libraries to analyze a specific stock (in this case, Apple Inc.) and identify potential profitable trades based on the Moving Average Crossover Strategy. This is a very basic form of market analysis and should not be used as the sole decision-making tool for real-world trading.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for required stocks
ticker = "AAPL"
ticker_data = yf.download(ticker,'2020-1-1','2022-12-31')

# Calculate Simple Moving Average with 14 days window
ticker_data['SMA_14'] = ticker_data['Close'].rolling(window=14).mean()

# Calculate Simple Moving Average with 50 days window
ticker_data['SMA_50'] = ticker_data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a function to signal when to buy and sell an asset
def generate_signals(data):
    buy_signal = []
    sell_signal = []
    for i in range(len(data)):
        if data['SMA_14'][i] > data['SMA_50'][i]:
            buy_signal.append(np.nan)
            sell_signal.append(data['Close'][i])
        elif data['SMA_14'][i] < data['SMA_50'][i]:
            sell_signal.append(np.nan)
            buy_signal.append(data['Close'][i])
        else:
            buy_signal.append(np.nan)
            sell_signal.append(np.nan)
    return buy_signal, sell_signal

# Create buy and sell column
ticker_data['Buy_Signal_Price'] = generate_signals(ticker_data)[0]
ticker_data['Sell_Signal_Price'] = generate_signals(ticker_data)[1]

# Plotting the stock price, SMA_14 and SMA_50 to visualize when to buy and sell
plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
plt.plot(ticker_data['Close'], label='Close Price', color='blue', alpha=0.35)
plt.plot(ticker_data['SMA_14'], label='SMA_14', color='red', alpha=0.35)
plt.plot(ticker_data['SMA_50'], label='SMA_50', color='green', alpha=0.35)
plt.scatter(ticker_data.index, ticker_data['Buy_Signal_Price'], color='green', marker='^', alpha=1)
plt.scatter(ticker_data.index, ticker_data['Sell_Signal_Price'], color='red', marker='v', alpha=1)
plt.title('Apple Inc. Close Price History with Buy & Sell signals')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Close Price USD ($)')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```

This code will plot the close price history of Apple Inc. along with the Simple Moving Averages for 14 days and 50 days. The green upward-pointing triangles indicate a buy signal (when the 14-day SMA crosses above the 50-day SMA), and the red downward-pointing triangles indicate a sell signal (when the 14-day SMA crosses below the 50-day SMA).

Please note that this is a very simplistic form of market analysis and does not take into account many other factors that can influence a stock's price. Always do thorough research before making trading decisions.
