Sure, here is a basic Python code that uses a simple moving average strategy to analyze market conditions and adjust trading strategies. This code uses the `yfinance` library to get stock data and `pandas` to analyze it.

Please note that this is a simple example and real trading algorithms can be much more complex and consider many more factors.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    return data.rolling(window=window).mean()

def analyze_market(symbol):
    # Download historical data as dataframe
    data = yf.download(symbol, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

    # Calculate short-term and long-term simple moving average
    data['Short_SMA'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], window=20)
    data['Long_SMA'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], window=100)

    # Create a column 'Signal' such that if Short_SMA > Long_SMA then buy else sell
    data['Signal'] = 0.0  
    data['Signal'][data['Short_SMA'] > data['Long_SMA']] = 1.0   
    data['Signal'][data['Short_SMA'] < data['Long_SMA']] = -1.0   

    return data

def adjust_strategy(data):
    # If the last signal was to buy, then we will continue to hold, else we will sell
    if data['Signal'].iloc[-1] == 1.0:
        return 'Hold'
    else:
        return 'Sell'

# Analyze market for a symbol
data = analyze_market('AAPL')

# Adjust strategy based on market analysis
strategy = adjust_strategy(data)
print(f'The trading strategy for AAPL is: {strategy}')
```

This script downloads the historical data for a given symbol, calculates the short-term and long-term simple moving averages, and generates trading signals based on these averages. If the short-term average is greater than the long-term average, it's a signal to buy, otherwise, it's a signal to sell. The `adjust_strategy` function then decides whether to hold or sell based on the last signal.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and might not be profitable in real trading. Always do your own research and consider multiple factors before making trading decisions.
