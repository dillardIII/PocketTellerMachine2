Here is some illustrative Python code that represents our goal of active participation in the market and avoiding zero trades. This code creates a simple trading bot using an API of a fictional trading platform for the sake of this example.

```python
import requests
import time

API_URL = "https://api.tradingplatform.com"
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

def fetch_latest_price(asset):
    response = requests.get(f"{API_URL}/price?asset={asset}", headers={"API-Key": API_KEY})
    return response.json()['price']

def place_trade(asset, action, amount):
    data = {
        'asset': asset,
        'action': action,
        'amount': amount
    }
    response = requests.post(f"{API_URL}/trade", headers={"API-Key": API_KEY}, json=data)
    return response.status_code == 200

def trading_bot(asset_to_trade, buy_threshold, sell_threshold, trade_amount):
    while True:
        try:
            price = fetch_latest_price(asset_to_trade)

            if price <= buy_threshold:
                print(f"Placing buy trade for {asset_to_trade} as price is {price} which is below the threshold {buy_threshold}")
                response = place_trade(asset_to_trade, 'buy', trade_amount)
                if response:
                    print(f"Successful in placing buy trade for {asset_to_trade}")
                else:
                    print("Failed to place buy trade")
                    
            elif price >= sell_threshold:
                print(f"Placing sell trade for {asset_to_trade} as price is {price} which is above the threshold {sell_threshold}")
                response = place_trade(asset_to_trade, 'sell', trade_amount)
                if response:
                    print(f"Successful in placing sell trade for {asset_to_trade}")
                else:
                    print("Failed to place sell trade")
                    
            time.sleep(60)  # cool down before next price check
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")

# run bot for asset 'BTC' and a given buy/sell threshold.
trading_bot('BTC', 50000, 60000, 0.01)
```
The `trading_bot` function runs indefinitely and checks the current asset price every minute. When the price is below the `buy_threshold`, a buy trade is placed. When the price is above the `sell_threshold`, a sell trade is placed. 

This bot guarantees that we always place at least some trades and thus ensures active engagement in the market, but please note this simple bot also has the potential to make unprofitable trades if the price moves unfavorably after a trade is placed. Adding more sophisticated trading rules or algorithms, such as the proportion of the portfolio to trade, stop losses, trailing stops, etc., can help manage this risk.
