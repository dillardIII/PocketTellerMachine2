Your request seems to seek some Python code that would trigger trading activities if no wins or losses were reported for a trading system on a specific day. However, without knowing more specifics about the trading system, I can only give a general overview using pseudo code. Please note this isn't a complete code and will need a lot of adjustment to fit into an existing system.

A possibility could be something like:

```python
class Trading:
    def __init__(self):
        self.transaction = []
    
    def add_transaction(self, operation, amount):
        self.transaction.append({
            'operation': operation,
            'amount': amount
        })
    
    def get_balance(self):
        return sum([t['amount'] for t in self.transaction if t['operation'] == 'win']) - \
                sum([t['amount'] for t in self.transaction if t['operation'] == 'loss'])

PTM = Trading()
# Add transactions to PTM instance here.

# Check if there is no operation recorded in this day
if len(PTM.transaction) == 0:
    print("Engage in trading activities")
else:
    balance = PTM.get_balance()
    if balance == 0:
        print("No wins or losses were reported for today. Engage in trading activities")
    elif balance > 0:
        print("For today, we have a win of " + str(balance))
    else:
        print("For today, we have a loss of " + str(-balance))
```

In the provided code we define a class `Trading` to hold information about transactions. If the balance for all transactions equals zero or there were no transactions at all, we output a message that PTM should engage in trading activities. Otherwise, we print if the day was a win or a loss.

Please note that you have to collect all the operations for the current day and add it to `PTM` instance before checking the balance.
