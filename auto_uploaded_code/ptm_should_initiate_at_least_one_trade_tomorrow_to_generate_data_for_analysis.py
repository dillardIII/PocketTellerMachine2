To initiate a trade, we would need to interact with a trading API. Here's a simple example of how you might do this using the Alpaca API, which allows for algorithmic trading. Please replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your actual API keys.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up API connection
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Define the trade parameters
symbol = 'AAPL'  # Apple stock
qty = 1  # Buy 1 share
side = 'buy'  # Buy order
type = 'market'  # Market order
time_in_force = 'gtc'  # Good till cancelled

# Submit the trade
api.submit_order(
    symbol=symbol,
    qty=qty,
    side=side,
    type=type,
    time_in_force=time_in_force
)
```

This code will initiate a trade to buy one share of Apple stock at the market price. The order will remain open until it is filled or cancelled.

Please note that this is a very basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle errors, check the status of the order, and potentially implement more complex trading logic.
