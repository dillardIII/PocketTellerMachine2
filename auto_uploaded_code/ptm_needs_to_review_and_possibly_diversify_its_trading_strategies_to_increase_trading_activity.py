To complete this task, we need to analyze the current trading strategies and their performance. We can do this by creating a Python script that analyzes the trading data. However, without specific data or trading strategies, I can only provide a general structure of the code.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Load the trading data
# This is just a placeholder, replace it with your actual data
data = pd.read_csv('trading_data.csv')

# Assume we have 'strategy', 'profit' and 'volume' columns in our data
# 'strategy' is the trading strategy used
# 'profit' is the profit made from the trade
# 'volume' is the volume of the trade

# Group the data by strategy and calculate the total profit and average volume for each strategy
grouped = data.groupby('strategy').agg({'profit': 'sum', 'volume': 'mean'})

# Normalize the data for clustering
grouped['profit'] = (grouped['profit'] - grouped['profit'].min()) / (grouped['profit'].max() - grouped['profit'].min())
grouped['volume'] = (grouped['volume'] - grouped['volume'].min()) / (grouped['volume'].max() - grouped['volume'].min())

# Use KMeans clustering to identify different types of trading strategies
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=0).fit(grouped)

# Add the cluster labels to the grouped data
grouped['cluster'] = kmeans.labels_

# Print the grouped data
print(grouped)
```

This script groups the trading data by strategy and calculates the total profit and average volume for each strategy. It then normalizes these values and uses KMeans clustering to identify different types of trading strategies. The cluster labels are added to the grouped data and the data is printed.

To diversify the trading strategies, PTM could consider using strategies from different clusters. This would ensure that they are not overly reliant on a single type of strategy.

Please replace the placeholder with your actual data and adjust the code according to your needs.
