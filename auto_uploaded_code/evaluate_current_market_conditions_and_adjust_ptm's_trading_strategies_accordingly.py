As an AI text-based model, I can't directly interact with real-time data or APIs. However, I can provide you with a sample Python code that simulates this task. In a real-world scenario, you would need to connect to a live market data feed and a trading platform's API. Here's a simple example of how you might structure such a program:

```python
import pandas as pd
from alpha_vantage.timeseries import TimeSeries
from trading_strategy import TradingStrategy  # A hypothetical module you might have

# You need to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual Alpha Vantage API key
ts = TimeSeries(key='YOUR_API_KEY', output_format='pandas')

# Get the last 100 close prices for a given stock symbol (e.g., 'GOOGL')
data, meta_data = ts.get_intraday(symbol='GOOGL', interval='1min', outputsize='full')
close_prices = data['4. close'][-100:]

# Instantiate a trading strategy
strategy = TradingStrategy()

# Evaluate market conditions based on the close prices
market_conditions = strategy.evaluate_market_conditions(close_prices)

# Adjust the trading strategy based on the market conditions
strategy.adjust_strategy(market_conditions)

# Execute the trading strategy
strategy.execute()
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle errors, possibly use async I/O for better performance, and consider many other factors that can influence your trading strategy. Also, the `TradingStrategy` class is not implemented in this example. You would need to design this class according to your trading rules and strategies.
