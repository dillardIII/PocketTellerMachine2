Sure, here's a simple Python code that uses the Alpaca API to initiate a trade. Please replace the placeholders with your actual API keys and desired stock symbol.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API connection
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets')

# Get account information
account = api.get_account()
print(account)

# Check if the market is open
clock = api.get_clock()
print('The market is {}'.format('open.' if clock.is_open else 'closed.'))

# Define the stock symbol to trade
symbol = '<STOCK-SYMBOL>'

# Get the last trade for the stock
last_trade = api.get_last_trade(symbol)
print('The last trade for {} was {}'.format(symbol, last_trade.price))

# Initiate a trade
api.submit_order(
    symbol=symbol,
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code will initiate a market order to buy 1 share of the specified stock. Please note that this is a very basic example and doesn't include any kind of risk management or strategy. Also, it's using the paper trading API, so it's not trading with real money.
