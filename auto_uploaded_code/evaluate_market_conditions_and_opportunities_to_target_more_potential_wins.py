To evaluate market conditions and opportunities to assist Cole in targeting more potential wins, we'll want to analyze market data. That might involve Python code to fetch and visualize financial data, calculate technical indicators (like Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Relative Strength Index (RSI), etc.), and test various trading strategies.

Due to limitations, providing comprehensive code here to fetch live market data is not feasible but I can show you general foundations for this kind of task.

Before proceeding, make sure you have yfinance, pandas, matplotlib, and numpy libraries installed.

```python
# Import required libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from datetime import datetime

# Fetch stock data 
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end=datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))

# Calculate Moving Averages (Short term and long term)
data['Short_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['Long_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.grid(True)
plt.plot(data['Close'],label='Close')
plt.plot(data['Short_MA'], label='Short term MA')
plt.plot(data['Long_MA'], label='Long term MA')
plt.legend(loc=2)
plt.show()

# Potential trading opportunities
# Buy when short term MA is above long term MA
# Sell when short term MA is below long term MA
data['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(data['Short_MA'] > data['Long_MA'], 'Buy', 'No signal')
data['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(data['Short_MA'] < data['Long_MA'], 'Sell', 'No signal')

print(data)
```
This code fetches data from Yahoo Finance API for the Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, calculates the short-term and long-term moving averages, and plots it. Based on these moving averages (MA), the code also generates potential buy and sell signals. A signal to buy is generated when the short-term MA goes above the long-term MA, and a sell signal is generated when it goes below.

This is a very basic approach and should be used as a starting point. Real trading decisions should consider various other factors and potentially use more sophisticated machine learning techniques for prediction. Also, always remember that trading in financial markets involves risk.
