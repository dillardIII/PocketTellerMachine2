Here's a simple implementation that uses Python to simulate trading, decide whether to buy or sell based on the simulated returns, and stores the outcomes of each trade for learning:

```python
import numpy as np

class TradingBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.funds = 10000  # initial funds, in $
        self.position = 0  # no. of owned shares
        self.trading_history = []  # history to store trading outcomes

    def get_market_data(self):
        # For simplicity, let's assume the prices are random
        prices = np.random.randn(100) + 100  # random prices around 100
        returns = prices[1:]/prices[:-1] - 1  # calculate returns
        return returns

    def decide_trade(self, returns):
        if np.mean(returns) > 0:  # if average returns are positive
            return "buy"
        else:
            return "sell"

    def execute_trade(self, decision):
        price = np.random.randn() + 100  # current market price
        if decision == "buy":
            self.position += self.funds/price  # buy as much as possible
            self.funds = 0  # all money is invested
        elif decision == "sell":
            self.funds += self.position*price  # sell all shares
            self.position = 0  # no shares owned
        
        self.trading_history.append((decision, self.funds, self.position))

    def start_trading(self):
        for _ in range(100):  # simulate 100 days of trading
            market_data = self.get_market_data()
            trade_decision = self.decide_trade(market_data)
            self.execute_trade(trade_decision)

bot = TradingBot()
bot.start_trading()

# print trading history
for decision, funds, position in bot.trading_history:
    print(f"Decided to {decision}. Current funds: {funds}, current position: {position}")
```

This is a very simple example of a trading bot, which obviously doesn't make profitable trades. It doesn't take into account transaction costs, the risk of the trade, slippage etc. A more sophisticated bot could use advanced machine learning algorithms to make trade decisions.

Also, it's important to note that this example uses simulated market data. In a real-world setting, you'd want to replace this with actual market data, which you can get through an API or other data source.
