To analyze market trends and indicators, we can use the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis, yfinance to download stock price data, and matplotlib for data visualization. Here's a simple Python script that downloads the historical data for a specific stock, calculates its moving averages, and plots the data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA10'] = data['Close'].rolling(10).mean()
data['MA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(50).mean()

# Plot closing price and moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Closing Price', color='blue')
plt.plot(data['MA10'], label='10-day MA', color='red')
plt.plot(data['MA50'], label='50-day MA', color='green')
plt.title('Historical stock price of ' + ticker)
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This script will plot the closing price, 10-day moving average, and 50-day moving average for Apple Inc. from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022. Moving averages are commonly used indicators in stock market analysis.

Please note that this is a very basic form of market analysis and doesn't take into account many other factors that can influence a stock's price. For a more comprehensive analysis, you might want to consider other indicators such as volume, volatility, earnings reports, economic indicators, etc. Also, consider using machine learning algorithms for more sophisticated predictions.
