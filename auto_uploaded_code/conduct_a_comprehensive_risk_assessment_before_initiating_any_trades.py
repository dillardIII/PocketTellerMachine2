Completing a comprehensive risk assessment in trading involves various steps. We need to examine different types of risks such as market risk, credit risk, and operational risk, and they can be assessed using various metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), and stress testing.

However, here I am giving you a simple example of how to calculate VaR (Value at Risk) using Python. VaR gives a measure of how much we can expect to lose for a given level of confidence:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import fix_yahoo_finance as yf
yf.pdr_override()
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import norm

# Define the instruments to download. We would download stocks info - IBM, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG
tickers = ['IBM', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'GOOG']

# Define which online source to use
data_source = 'yahoo'

# Define the start and end dates 
start_date = '2019-01-01'
end_date = '2020-02-01'

# Use pandas_datareader.data.DataReader to load the desired data
panel_data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickers, start_date, end_date)

# Getting just the adjusted closing prices. This will return a Pandas DataFrame
close_data = panel_data['Adj Close']

# Calculate the returns 
returns = close_data.pct_change()

# Compute VaR
mean = np.mean(returns)
std_dev = np.std(returns)
VaR = norm.ppf(1-0.95, mean, std_dev)

# Print Value at risk (VaR)
print('Value at Risk (VaR) for each stock is: ')
print(VaR)
```

In the python code above, we calculate the Value at Risk (VaR) for IBM, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG stocks. The VaR value will give a measure of the maximum potential loss at a given confidence level (95% in the above case). This is a basic measure of loss risk and additional metrics and stress testing would be required to get a more comprehensive risk assessment.
