As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I can't execute real-time Python code or interact with live databases or APIs. However, I can provide you with a basic example of how you might structure your Python code to conduct market research. 

In this example, I'll use the `yfinance` library to download stock data, and `pandas` to analyze it. Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading involves much more complex analysis and considerations.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Define the list of stocks we are interested in
stocks = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'FB']

# Define the period for which we want to get data
period = '1d'

# Create an empty DataFrame to store the data
data = pd.DataFrame()

# Download and append the data for each stock
for stock in stocks:
    data[stock] = yf.download(stock, period=period)['Close']

# Calculate the percentage change for each stock
data = data.pct_change()

# Identify the stocks with the highest positive change
potential_trades = data[data > 0].idxmax(axis=1)

print(potential_trades)
```

This code will print the stock with the highest percentage increase for the day. This is a very simplistic approach and doesn't take into account many factors that should be considered when trading, such as volume, volatility, trends, etc. It's also important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.

Please replace the stock symbols and period with the ones you are interested in and make sure to handle exceptions and errors in the code.
