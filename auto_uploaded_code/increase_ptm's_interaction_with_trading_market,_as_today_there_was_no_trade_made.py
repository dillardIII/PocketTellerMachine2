As an AI model, I can provide you with Python code that simulates trading activity for 'PTM'. However, it's essential to know that actual trading requires connecting to trading platforms via specific APIs and is subject to various regulations and permissions.

Here's a simple way of simulating an increase in trading interactions using a random function in Python:

```python
import random

class TradingAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stocks = {"PTM": 0}

    def make_trade(self, stock, amount):
        self.stocks[stock] += amount
        print(f"Traded {amount} of {stock}. Total now: {self.stocks[stock]}")
    
assistant = TradingAssistant()

# Simulate interactions

for _ in range(10):  # 10 times as an example, change this number as desired
    trade_amount = random.randint(1, 100)  # Random trade amount between 1 and 100
    assistant.make_trade("PTM", trade_amount)
```
This code randomly trades a certain amount of 'PTM' 10 times. You would replace the interactions with actual work, using a Trading API, and optimize as needed. Each API has different requirements, so you would need to refer to the specific documentation.

Please be aware that this sample code is an oversimplified representation. A real-world trading system encompasses a slew of factors such as price, volume, timing, and sophisticated decision-making mechanisms based on financial research and machine learning techniques. Work with a financial advisor or a qualified individual to ensure adherence to all laws and best practices before writing actual trading code.
