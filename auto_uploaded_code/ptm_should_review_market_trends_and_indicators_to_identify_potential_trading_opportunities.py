As an AI model, I can provide you with a basic Python code that uses the pandas library to analyze market trends. However, this is a simplified version and real-world trading algorithms are far more complex and require a lot more data and advanced methods to be effective. Also, it's important to note that this code doesn't make any actual trades, it just analyzes data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as web
import datetime as dt

# Define the start and end dates for the data
start = dt.datetime(2020,1,1)
end = dt.datetime.now()

# Get the data for a specific stock (e.g., Apple)
df = web.DataReader('AAPL', 'yahoo', start, end)

# Calculate the moving averages
df['MA10'] = df['Adj Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
df['MA50'] = df['Adj Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a function to signal when to buy/sell the stock
def buy_sell(signal):
    Buy = []
    Sell = []
    flag = -1

    for i in range(0,len(signal)):
        if signal['MA10'][i] > signal['MA50'][i]:
            Sell.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 1:
                Buy.append(signal['Adj Close'][i])
                flag = 1
            else:
                Buy.append(np.nan)
        elif signal['MA10'][i] < signal['MA50'][i]:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 0:
                Sell.append(signal['Adj Close'][i])
                flag = 0
            else:
                Sell.append(np.nan)
        else:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            Sell.append(np.nan)

    return (Buy, Sell)

# Create buy and sell columns
df['Buy_Signal_Price'] = buy_sell(df)[0]
df['Sell_Signal_Price'] = buy_sell(df)[1]

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```

This script fetches historical data for Apple's stock, calculates 10-day and 50-day moving averages, and then generates buy/sell signals based on these averages. It's a very basic form of a trading strategy known as a moving average crossover.

Please note that this is a very simplified trading strategy and should not be used for actual trading without further improvements. Always consult with a financial advisor before making trading decisions.
