In order to analyze market trends and patterns, we would need historical market data. This data can be obtained from various sources such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or other financial data providers.

Here is a simple Python script using pandas library to fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance and analyze it:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Plot the closing price
data['Close'].plot()
plt.title(f'{ticker} Closing Price')
plt.show()

# Decompose the time series data to observe trends and seasonality
result = seasonal_decompose(data['Close'], model='multiplicative', period=1)
result.plot()
plt.show()
```

This script will download the historical data for the Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, plot the closing price, and then decompose the time series data to observe any trends and seasonality.

Please note that this is a very basic script and real-world market analysis would require much more complex algorithms and models. Also, you need to install the required libraries (pandas, yfinance, matplotlib, statsmodels) using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas yfinance matplotlib statsmodels
```

Also, please note that this script assumes that the market trends and patterns can be observed from the closing price of the stocks. In the real world, there are many more factors that can influence the market trends and patterns.
