Sure, I can provide a basic example of how you might initiate a trade using a Python library like Alpaca (a commission-free trading platform). However, please note that this is a simplified example and real trading involves careful strategy and risk management.

Firstly, you need to install the Alpaca API. You can do this with pip:

```python
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Here's a simple Python script that uses the Alpaca API to initiate a trade:

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Define the symbol and parameters for the trade
symbol = 'AAPL'
qty = 1
side = 'buy'
type = 'market'
time_in_force = 'gtc'

# Initiate the trade
api.submit_order(
    symbol=symbol,
    qty=qty,
    side=side,
    type=type,
    time_in_force=time_in_force
)
```

This script will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple (AAPL) at the current market price. The trade is a 'good till cancelled' order, which means it will remain open until it is filled or manually cancelled.

Please replace '<APCA-API-KEY-ID>' and '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>' with your actual Alpaca API key ID and secret key.

Remember, this is just a basic example. A real trading bot would need to implement more complex strategies, handle errors, and manage risk. Always be careful when trading with real money.
