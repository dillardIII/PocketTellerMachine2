Sure, I can provide a simple Python code to simulate diversification of a portfolio. However, please note that in real-life scenarios, portfolio diversification involves complex strategies and decisions based on various factors such as risk tolerance, investment horizon, market conditions, etc. 

Here's a simple Python code using pandas and yfinance libraries to download stock data and calculate portfolio returns and volatility. This code assumes an equally weighted portfolio of 5 different stocks.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np

# Define the stocks to include in the portfolio
stocks = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'FB']

# Download stock data
data = yf.download(stocks, start='2020-01-01', end=datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))

# Use only Close price for each stock
data = data['Close']

# Calculate daily returns
returns = data.pct_change()

# Assume equal weighting for each stock
weights = np.array([0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2])

# Calculate portfolio return
portfolio_return = np.sum(returns.mean() * weights) * 252
print(f"Expected Portfolio Return: {portfolio_return}")

# Calculate portfolio variance
portfolio_variance = np.sqrt(np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(returns.cov() * 252, weights)))
print(f"Expected Portfolio Volatility: {portfolio_variance}")

# Calculate portfolio standard deviation (risk)
portfolio_std_dev = np.sqrt(np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(returns.cov() * 252, weights)))
print(f"Expected Portfolio Risk: {portfolio_std_dev}")
```

This code calculates the expected return, volatility (standard deviation of returns), and risk (also standard deviation) of the portfolio. Diversification is achieved by including different stocks in the portfolio. 

Please install necessary libraries by using pip install command if not already installed. 

```python
pip install pandas yfinance
```

Remember, this is a very basic example and real portfolio diversification involves much more complex strategies and risk management techniques.
