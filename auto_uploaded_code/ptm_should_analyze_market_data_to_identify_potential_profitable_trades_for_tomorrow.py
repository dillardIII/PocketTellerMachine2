As an AI model, I can't actually connect to real-time market data or execute trades. However, I can provide you with a basic Python code that uses historical data to analyze and identify potential profitable trades. This code uses a simple moving average strategy, which is a common technique in stock trading.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL' # Apple Inc.

# Get data for the past 60 days
end_date = datetime.now()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=60)

# Get the data
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)
df = tickerData.history(period='1d', start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Calculate the 5 days and 20 days moving averages
df['5_days_SMA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=5).mean()
df['20_days_SMA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Create a function to signal when to buy and sell an asset
def generate_signals(df):
    buy_signal = []
    sell_signal = []
    
    for i in range(len(df)):
        if df['5_days_SMA'].iloc[i] > df['20_days_SMA'].iloc[i]: # If short term average surpasses
            buy_signal.append(np.nan)
            sell_signal.append(df['Close'].iloc[i])
        elif df['5_days_SMA'].iloc[i] < df['20_days_SMA'].iloc[i]: # If long term average surpasses
            sell_signal.append(np.nan)
            buy_signal.append(df['Close'].iloc[i])
        else:
            sell_signal.append(np.nan)
            buy_signal.append(np.nan)
            
    return buy_signal, sell_signal

df['Buy_Signal_Price'] = generate_signals(df)[0]
df['Sell_Signal_Price'] = generate_signals(df)[1]

print(df)
```

This code fetches the last 60 days of data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance, calculates the 5-day and 20-day simple moving averages, and generates buy and sell signals based on these averages. 

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and doesn't take into account many factors that could influence trading decisions. Also, you need to install the `yfinance` library to fetch the data from Yahoo Finance.

You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance
```

Please consult with a financial advisor or use a more sophisticated algorithm for actual trading.
