In order to write a Python code for your task brief, we need to make a few assumptions. This includes defining what is a successful trade to PTM, how and where it trades, and which algorithms it uses.

Due to the lack of information, I can provide you with a very simple sample of executing a trade in Python using the Alpaca API, which is a platform allowing you to manage your portfolio, place orders, access real-time market data.

Replace "APCA-API-KEY-ID" and "APCA-API-SECRET-KEY" with your actual API key ID and secret key that you can obtain from the Alpaca dashboard.

Take note that this is a simulated trade and may not be entirely functional. Please optimize it according to your settings and trading strategy or algorithm before using for actual trading.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets')

# Check if the market is open tomorrow
clock = api.get_clock()
next_open = clock.next_open

if next_open.date() == datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(days=1):
    # Market is open tomorrow, we can trade

    # Setting up a trade - buying 1 share of Apple's stock (just a simulation)
    api.submit_order(
        symbol='AAPL',
        qty=1,
        side='buy',
        type="market",
        time_in_force="gtc"
    )
```

This is just the skeleton code. You should add conditions for actual trading considering risk management, actual stocks you want to buy or sell, quantity, position sizing, and timing. You might also want to incorporate machine learning or statistical methods for predicting which stocks to buy or sell.

For more details on how to use Alpaca's API with Python check their official documentation.
