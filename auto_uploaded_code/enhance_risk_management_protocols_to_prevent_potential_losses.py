To enhance risk management protocols, we can implement a few strategies such as setting stop loss and take profit levels, diversifying the portfolio, and constantly monitoring the market conditions. Here's a basic example of how you might implement some of these strategies in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

class RiskManagement:
    def __init__(self, portfolio):
        self.portfolio = portfolio

    def set_stop_loss(self, stock, stop_loss_level):
        data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(stock, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")
        current_price = data['Close'][-1]
        if current_price <= stop_loss_level:
            self.sell_stock(stock)
            print(f"Sold {stock} due to stop loss trigger at {stop_loss_level}")

    def set_take_profit(self, stock, take_profit_level):
        data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(stock, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")
        current_price = data['Close'][-1]
        if current_price >= take_profit_level:
            self.sell_stock(stock)
            print(f"Sold {stock} due to take profit trigger at {take_profit_level}")

    def sell_stock(self, stock):
        if stock in self.portfolio:
            del self.portfolio[stock]

    def diversify_portfolio(self):
        if len(self.portfolio) > 10:
            print("Your portfolio is diversified")
        else:
            print("You need to diversify your portfolio")

    def monitor_market(self):
        for stock in self.portfolio:
            data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(stock, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")
            print(f"Current price of {stock} is {data['Close'][-1]}")

portfolio = {'AAPL': 100, 'GOOG': 50, 'TSLA': 70}
rm = RiskManagement(portfolio)
rm.set_stop_loss('AAPL', 120)
rm.set_take_profit('GOOG', 2000)
rm.diversify_portfolio()
rm.monitor_market()
```

Please note that this is a very basic example of risk management in trading. In real-world applications, you would need to consider many other factors and use more sophisticated strategies. Also, please replace the start and end dates in the `pdr.get_data_yahoo` function with the appropriate dates.
