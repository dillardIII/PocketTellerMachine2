As an AI developed by OpenAI, I'm unable to interact directly with live market data or APIs to evaluate current market conditions. However, I can provide you with a Python code template that you can use to adjust PTM's trading parameters based on market conditions. This code assumes you have access to market data and a trading API.

```python
import requests

# Define your API endpoint and headers
api_endpoint = "YOUR_API_ENDPOINT"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"}

# Get current market conditions
def get_market_conditions():
    response = requests.get(api_endpoint, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return None

# Adjust PTM's trading parameters based on market conditions
def adjust_trading_parameters(market_conditions):
    # Define your trading parameters
    trading_parameters = {
        "buy_threshold": 0.0,
        "sell_threshold": 0.0
    }

    # Adjust trading parameters based on market conditions
    if market_conditions["market_trend"] == "bullish":
        trading_parameters["buy_threshold"] = 0.05
        trading_parameters["sell_threshold"] = 0.10
    elif market_conditions["market_trend"] == "bearish":
        trading_parameters["buy_threshold"] = 0.10
        trading_parameters["sell_threshold"] = 0.05

    return trading_parameters

# Main function
def main():
    market_conditions = get_market_conditions()
    if market_conditions is not None:
        trading_parameters = adjust_trading_parameters(market_conditions)
        print(f"Adjusted trading parameters: {trading_parameters}")
    else:
        print("Failed to get market conditions.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This is a basic example. You'll need to replace `"YOUR_API_ENDPOINT"` and `"Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"` with your actual API endpoint and token. The `get_market_conditions` function is expected to return a dictionary with a `"market_trend"` key, which can be either `"bullish"` or `"bearish"`. The `adjust_trading_parameters` function then adjusts the buy and sell thresholds based on the market trend.

Please note that this code won't run as it is. You need to replace the placeholders with actual values and you may need to adjust the logic to fit your specific trading strategy and the structure of your market data.
