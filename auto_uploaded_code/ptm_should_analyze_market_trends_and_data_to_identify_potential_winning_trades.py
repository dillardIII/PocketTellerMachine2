Here is a simple example of how you could analyze market trends and data using Python. This example uses the pandas library to analyze data and the yfinance library to get stock market data. 

Please note that identifying potential winning trades involves complex algorithms and deep understanding of the stock market. This is a very basic example and should not be used for actual trading.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['MA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Create a function to signal when to buy and sell an asset
def identify_trades(data):
    buy_list = []
    sell_list = []
    flag = False

    for i in range(0, len(data)):
        if data['MA_50'][i] > data['MA_200'][i]:
            if flag != 1:
                buy_list.append(data['Close'][i])
                sell_list.append(np.nan)
                flag = 1
            else:
                buy_list.append(np.nan)
                sell_list.append(np.nan)
        elif data['MA_50'][i] < data['MA_200'][i]:
            if flag != 0:
                sell_list.append(data['Close'][i])
                buy_list.append(np.nan)
                flag = 0
            else:
                buy_list.append(np.nan)
                sell_list.append(np.nan)
        else:
            buy_list.append(np.nan)
            sell_list.append(np.nan)

    return (buy_list, sell_list)

# Add the buy and sell signals to the data
data['Buy_Signal_Price'] = identify_trades(data)[0]
data['Sell_Signal_Price'] = identify_trades(data)[1]

# Print the data
print(data)
```

This script downloads historical data for the Apple stock, calculates the 50 and 200 day moving averages, and generates buy/sell signals based on these averages. A buy signal is generated when the 50 day moving average crosses above the 200 day moving average, and a sell signal is generated when the 50 day moving average crosses below the 200 day moving average.

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and is not guaranteed to be profitable. It's always important to do your own research and consider multiple factors when deciding when to buy or sell a stock.
