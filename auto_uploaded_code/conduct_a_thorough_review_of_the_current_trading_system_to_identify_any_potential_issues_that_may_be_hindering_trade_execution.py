As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I can't directly interact with your trading system to conduct a review. However, I can provide you with a general Python script that you can use to analyze your trading data. This script assumes that you have a pandas DataFrame that contains your trading data.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df is your trading data DataFrame
# df = pd.read_csv('your_trading_data.csv') 

def analyze_trading_data(df):
    # Check for missing values
    missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
    print("Missing values in each column:\n", missing_values)

    # Check for duplicates
    duplicate_rows = df.duplicated().sum()
    print("Number of duplicate rows: ", duplicate_rows)

    # Check for trades that were not executed
    not_executed_trades = df[df['status'] != 'executed']
    print("Trades that were not executed:\n", not_executed_trades)

    # Check for trades with negative values
    negative_trades = df[df['trade_value'] < 0]
    print("Trades with negative values:\n", negative_trades)

    # Check for trades executed outside trading hours
    # Assuming trading hours are from 09:30 to 16:00
    df['execution_time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['execution_time'])
    outside_trading_hours = df[(df['execution_time'].dt.time < pd.to_datetime('09:30:00').time()) | 
                               (df['execution_time'].dt.time > pd.to_datetime('16:00:00').time())]
    print("Trades executed outside trading hours:\n", outside_trading_hours)

# Call the function with your DataFrame
# analyze_trading_data(df)
```

Please replace 'your_trading_data.csv' with your actual trading data file, and replace column names in the script with the actual column names in your data. 

This script will help you identify missing values, duplicate rows, trades that were not executed, trades with negative values, and trades executed outside trading hours. You can add more checks based on your specific needs.

Please note that you need to have the pandas library installed in your Python environment. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by running `pip install pandas` in your command line.
