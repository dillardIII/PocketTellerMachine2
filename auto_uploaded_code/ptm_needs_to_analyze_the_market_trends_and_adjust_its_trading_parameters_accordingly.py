To analyze market trends and adjust trading parameters, we need to have access to market data. Here's a simple example of how you can do this using Python, pandas and yfinance libraries. 

Please note that this is a basic example and real-world trading systems are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-1-25')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Calculate moving averages
tickerDf['MA10'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(10).mean()
tickerDf['MA50'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(50).mean()

# Define trading parameters
def adjust_trading_parameters(df):
    if df['MA10'][-1] > df['MA50'][-1]:
        print("Trend is up. Increase trading volume.")
        trading_volume = 100
    else:
        print("Trend is down. Decrease trading volume.")
        trading_volume = 50
    return trading_volume

# Adjust trading parameters
trading_volume = adjust_trading_parameters(tickerDf)
print("Trading volume is adjusted to: ", trading_volume)
```

This script downloads the historical price data for a specific ticker (in this case, Apple Inc.), calculates the 10-day and 50-day moving averages, and then adjusts the trading volume based on the trend. If the 10-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average, it increases the trading volume, indicating a bullish market. If the 10-day moving average is below the 50-day moving average, it decreases the trading volume, indicating a bearish market. 

Please note that this is a very simple trading strategy and should not be used for real trading without further enhancements.
