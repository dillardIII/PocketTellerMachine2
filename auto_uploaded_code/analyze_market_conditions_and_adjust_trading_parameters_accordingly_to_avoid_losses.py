Here is a simple example of how you might adjust trading parameters based on market conditions. This code assumes you have a way to measure market volatility and that you adjust your trading volume based on this volatility. 

Please note that this is a simplified example and real trading algorithms can be very complex and take into account many different factors.

```python
import numpy as np

class TradingParameters:
    def __init__(self, initial_investment):
        self.investment = initial_investment
        self.volume = 0.1 * initial_investment

    def adjust_volume(self, market_volatility):
        if market_volatility > 0.5:
            self.volume = 0.05 * self.investment
        elif market_volatility > 0.3:
            self.volume = 0.1 * self.investment
        else:
            self.volume = 0.2 * self.investment

def analyze_market(market_data):
    # This is a placeholder for real market analysis
    # In reality, you would use much more complex algorithms
    # to analyze the market conditions
    return np.std(market_data)

def main():
    initial_investment = 10000
    trading_parameters = TradingParameters(initial_investment)

    # Placeholder for real market data
    market_data = np.random.normal(size=100)

    market_volatility = analyze_market(market_data)
    trading_parameters.adjust_volume(market_volatility)

    print(f"Adjusted trading volume: {trading_parameters.volume}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, we first define a class `TradingParameters` that holds our current trading parameters. We then define a function `analyze_market` that analyzes the market conditions. In this case, we simply calculate the standard deviation of the market data as a measure of volatility. 

In the `main` function, we create an instance of `TradingParameters`, analyze the market conditions, and adjust the trading volume accordingly. The adjusted trading volume is then printed out.
