Sure, here's a basic Python script that simulates a trade using a simple strategy. For simplicity, let's assume we're trading a stock and we'll use a simple moving average crossover strategy for our trade. 

Please note that this is a simplified example and doesn't include real trading elements like trading fees, slippage, etc. Also, you need to have pandas_datareader and pandas libraries installed in your Python environment.

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

# Define the stock to be traded
stock = 'AAPL'

# Define the period for the moving averages
short_period = 50
long_period = 200

# Get the stock data
df = pdr.get_data_yahoo(stock)

# Calculate the short and long moving averages
df['Short_MA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=short_period).mean()
df['Long_MA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=long_period).mean()

# Create a column 'Signal' such that if the short moving average is greater than the long moving average
# then set Signal as 1 (indicating buy) else 0 (indicating sell)
df['Signal'] = 0.0  
df['Signal'][short_period:] = np.where(df['Short_MA'][short_period:] > df['Long_MA'][short_period:], 1.0, 0.0)   

# Create a column 'Position' which is the difference of the present and the previous day's 'Signal'
df['Position'] = df['Signal'].diff()

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)

# Now you can use 'Position' column to initiate trades. If 'Position' is 1, it means a buy trade should be initiated and if 'Position' is -1, it means a sell trade should be initiated.
```

This script fetches the historical data for the specified stock, calculates the short and long moving averages, and generates a trading signal based on these averages. A buy signal is generated when the short moving average crosses above the long moving average, and a sell signal is generated when the short moving average crosses below the long moving average. 

Please replace 'AAPL' with the actual stock symbol you want to trade. Also, you may need to adjust the short_period and long_period according to your trading strategy.
