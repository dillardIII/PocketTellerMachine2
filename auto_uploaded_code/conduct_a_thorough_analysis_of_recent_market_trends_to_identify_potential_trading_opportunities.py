As an AI, I can't directly analyze real-time data or connect to live databases. However, I can provide you with a Python code template that you can use to analyze market trends using pandas, yfinance, and matplotlib libraries. This code will fetch the historical data of a specific stock from Yahoo Finance and analyze it.

Please replace 'AAPL' with the ticker symbol of the stock you want to analyze.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters
register_matplotlib_converters()

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL','2020-01-01','2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Plotting the data
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Stock Price')
plt.plot(data['SMA_50'], label='50-day SMA')
plt.plot(data['SMA_200'], label='200-day SMA')
plt.title('Stock Price with SMA Crossover')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This code will plot the closing price of the stock along with its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA). A common trading strategy is to buy when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day SMA and sell when it crosses below.

Please note that this is a very basic form of analysis and real-world trading strategies involve much more complex analysis and risk management.
