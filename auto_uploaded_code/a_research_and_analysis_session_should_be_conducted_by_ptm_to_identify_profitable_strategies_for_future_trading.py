It seems like you want a Python script that simulates a research and analysis session conducted by PTM to identify profitable strategies. However, please note that developing strategies for trading and financial analysis require domain knowledge in finance, as well as expertise in stats and data analytics. 
Here is a simple Python program using pandas library to analyze historical trade data.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Assume we have a CSV file "historical_data.csv" with fields like 'Trade', 'Profit'
# Load the historical trade data from a csv file using pandas
trade_data = pd.read_csv("historical_data.csv")

# Assuming 'Trade' as independent variable and 'Profit' as dependent variable
X = trade_data['Trade'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = trade_data['Profit'].values.reshape(-1,1)

# Split the dataset into train and test
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Create Linear regression object
regressor = LinearRegression()  

# Trains the model using the training sets
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Prediction on test data
y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)

df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test.flatten(), 'Predicted': y_pred.flatten()})

print(df)
```

This is a simple linear regression model. In reality, trading strategies will involve complex machine learning models and would consider various factors. This kind of work should be executed in collaboration with data scientists and financial experts. Conducting a research and analysis session would probably include exploratory data analysis on the trading history, backtesting trading strategies, and finally identifying the most profitable strategy. 
The profit of a trading strategy usually depends on many factors such as risk tolerance, market conditions, trade volume and so on. Due to the risky nature of trading, it's also important to take into account risk management and other business rules. Therefore, more sophisticated models (like ARIMA, LSTM or even more complex) are usually used in development of real trading strategies.
