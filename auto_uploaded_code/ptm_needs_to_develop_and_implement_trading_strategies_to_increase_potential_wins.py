Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code that could be used to implement a basic trading strategy. This strategy will be based on moving averages, a common indicator used in trading. 

Please note that this is a very simple example and real trading strategies can be very complex and involve many different factors. Also, it's important to remember that all trading involves risk and this code is provided for educational purposes only.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as web

# Define the stock to be used
stock = 'AAPL'

# Define the period for the moving averages
short_window = 40
long_window = 100

# Load the data from Yahoo Finance
data = web.DataReader(stock, 'yahoo', start='01/01/2010', end='01/01/2022')

# Calculate the moving averages
data['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
data['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

# Create a column for the trading signals
data['signal'] = 0.0

# Generate trading signals (1 for buy, -1 for sell)
data['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(data['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                            > data['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, -1.0)

# Generate trading orders
data['positions'] = data['signal'].diff()

# Print the DataFrame
print(data)
```

This code will generate a trading signal when the short moving average crosses the long moving average. A buy signal is generated when the short moving average is above the long moving average and a sell signal is generated when the short moving average is below the long moving average.

Again, this is a very simple example and real trading strategies can be much more complex and involve many different factors.
