Creating an algorithm to analyze market trends and opportunities is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of finance and programming. Here is a simplified example of how you might approach this using Python and the pandas library to analyze stock data.

This example uses a simple moving average (SMA) strategy, which is a common technical analysis tool used to determine market trends. It calculates the average of a selected range of prices, usually closing prices, by the number of periods in that range.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    return data.rolling(window=window).mean()

def analyze_stock(symbol):
    # Download historical data as dataframe
    data = yf.download(symbol, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

    # Calculate 50 day SMA
    data['SMA_50'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], 50)

    # Calculate 200 day SMA
    data['SMA_200'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], 200)

    # Create a column to hold the trade signals
    data['Trade_Signal'] = 0.0

    # Generate trading signals based on the crossover strategy
    data['Trade_Signal'][50:] = np.where(data['SMA_50'][50:] > data['SMA_200'][50:], 1.0, 0.0)

    # Create a column to hold the positions of the stock
    data['Position'] = data['Trade_Signal'].diff()

    # Print the dataframe
    print(data)

    # Identify potential trades
    buy_signals = data[data['Position'] == 1.0]
    sell_signals = data[data['Position'] == -1.0]

    return buy_signals, sell_signals

# Analyze a stock
buy_signals, sell_signals = analyze_stock('AAPL')

print("Buy signals:")
print(buy_signals)

print("Sell signals:")
print(sell_signals)
```

This script downloads historical data for a given stock symbol, calculates 50-day and 200-day SMAs, and generates trading signals based on the crossover strategy. It then identifies potential buy and sell signals.

Please note that this is a very simple strategy and should not be used for real trading without further refinement and testing. Also, stock market trading involves risk and it's possible to incur significant losses.
