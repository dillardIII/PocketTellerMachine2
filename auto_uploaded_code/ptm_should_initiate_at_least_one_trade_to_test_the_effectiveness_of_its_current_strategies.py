Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that simulates a trade. This code is just a basic example and doesn't connect to any real trading API. 

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, ticker, volume):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.volume = volume

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_strategy = None

    def set_strategy(self, strategy):
        self.current_strategy = strategy

    def initiate_trade(self, trade):
        if self.current_strategy is None:
            print("No strategy set. Cannot initiate trade.")
            return

        print(f"Initiating trade. Ticker: {trade.ticker}, Volume: {trade.volume}")
        # Here you would connect to your trading API and execute the trade.
        # This is just a simulation, so we'll just print a message.
        print(f"Trade executed. Ticker: {trade.ticker}, Volume: {trade.volume}")

# Test the code
ptm = PTM()
ptm.set_strategy("Strategy1")
trade = Trade("AAPL", 100)
ptm.initiate_trade(trade)
```

This code defines a `Trade` class and a `PTM` class. The `PTM` class has a method `initiate_trade` that simulates initiating a trade. In a real-world scenario, you would replace the print statement with code that connects to your trading API and executes the trade.
