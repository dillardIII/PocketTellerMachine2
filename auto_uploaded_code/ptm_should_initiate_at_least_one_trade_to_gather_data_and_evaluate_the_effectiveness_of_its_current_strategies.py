Sure, here's a simple example of how you might initiate a trade in Python using the Alpaca API, which is a popular choice for algorithmic trading. 

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Initiate a trade
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This script will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple (AAPL) at the current market price. The 'gtc' time in force means that the order will remain in effect until it is either executed or cancelled.

Please replace '<APCA-API-KEY-ID>' and '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>' with your actual Alpaca API key ID and secret key.

After this, you would need to gather the data on this trade and evaluate the effectiveness of your strategy. This could involve tracking the price of AAPL over time, comparing it to various indicators, and so on. The specifics would depend on what your current strategies are.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real trading involves a lot more considerations and safety checks. Always make sure to thoroughly backtest any strategy before live trading.
