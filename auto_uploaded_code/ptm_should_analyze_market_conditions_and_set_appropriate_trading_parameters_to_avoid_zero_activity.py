Sure, here's a simple Python code that uses a hypothetical PTM (Python Trading Module) to analyze market conditions and set trading parameters. Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and require robust error handling and security measures.

```python
import PTM  # Hypothetical Python Trading Module

class TradingAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ptm = PTM.PTM()  # Initialize the Python Trading Module

    def analyze_market(self):
        market_conditions = self.ptm.get_market_conditions()  # Get market conditions

        # Set trading parameters based on market conditions
        if market_conditions == 'bull':
            self.ptm.set_trading_parameters(min_activity=0.1, max_activity=1.0)
        elif market_conditions == 'bear':
            self.ptm.set_trading_parameters(min_activity=0.01, max_activity=0.5)
        else:  # Neutral market
            self.ptm.set_trading_parameters(min_activity=0.05, max_activity=0.5)

    def execute_trade(self):
        self.analyze_market()  # Analyze market conditions
        self.ptm.execute_trade()  # Execute trade

# Usage
assistant = TradingAssistant()
assistant.execute_trade()
```

In this example, the `TradingAssistant` class has a method `analyze_market` that gets the current market conditions from the PTM and sets the trading parameters accordingly. The `execute_trade` method first analyzes the market conditions and then executes the trade.

Please replace `PTM` with the actual trading module you are using and adjust the parameters and conditions according to your needs.
