To analyze market trends and adjust strategies accordingly for potential trades, we would need to use some sort of machine learning or data analysis library, such as pandas for data manipulation and analysis, and sklearn for machine learning. Here is a very basic example of how you might start to set this up:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load market data into a pandas DataFrame
# For this example, let's assume we have a CSV file named 'market_data.csv'
market_data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Let's assume that our DataFrame has two columns: 'Trend' and 'Strategy'
# We want to predict the 'Strategy' based on the 'Trend'
X = market_data['Trend']
y = market_data['Strategy']

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Create a Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Now we can use our trained model to predict the 'Strategy' for new 'Trend' data
new_trend = [[7.2]]
predicted_strategy = model.predict(new_trend)

print(predicted_strategy)
```

Note: This is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would likely have many more factors to consider, and you would need to use more complex models and techniques. Also, you would need to have the actual market data to work with, which is not provided here.
