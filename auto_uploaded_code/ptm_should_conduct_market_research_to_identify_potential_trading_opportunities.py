To conduct market research for potential trading opportunities, we can use Python libraries such as pandas, yfinance, and matplotlib. Here is a simple example of how you might use these libraries to analyze stock data.

Please note that this is a very basic example. Real-world trading systems are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'GOOGL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-1-25')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Plot the close price of the stock
tickerDf['Close'].plot(title="Close price of "+tickerSymbol)
plt.show()

# Identify potential trading opportunities by analyzing the data
# For example, if the close price has been steadily increasing over the past few days, it might be a good time to buy
```

This script will download the historical price data for the specified ticker symbol (in this case, Google's stock) and plot the closing prices over time. You could then analyze this data to identify potential trading opportunities.

However, please note that this is a very basic form of analysis. In reality, you would likely want to use much more sophisticated techniques and take into account many more factors (such as volume, other market indicators, news events, etc.).
