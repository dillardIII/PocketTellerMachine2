To analyze market trends and conditions, we need to use historical market data. This data can be obtained from various sources. For this example, we will use the yfinance library to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance. We will also use the pandas library to manipulate and analyze this data.

Here is a simple Python script that identifies potential trading opportunities based on simple moving average (SMA) crossovers:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = "AAPL"
data = yf.download(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

# Calculate the short-term simple moving average
short_sma = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-term simple moving average
long_sma = data['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create a new column in the data dataframe to hold the trading signals
data['signal'] = 0.0

# Generate trading signals based on SMA crossovers
data['signal'][20:] = np.where(short_sma[20:] > long_sma[20:], 1.0, 0.0)

# Generate trading orders based on trading signals
data['positions'] = data['signal'].diff()

# Print data
print(data)
```

In this script, we first download the historical data for the desired ticker symbol. We then calculate the short-term and long-term simple moving averages of the closing prices. We generate trading signals based on these SMAs - a buy signal is generated when the short-term SMA crosses above the long-term SMA, and a sell signal is generated when the short-term SMA crosses below the long-term SMA.

Please note that this is a very simplistic trading strategy and may not be profitable in real trading. It is always recommended to use more complex strategies and to thoroughly backtest them before using them in live trading.
