To conduct a thorough market analysis, we would need to use APIs from financial data providers like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Google Finance. Here is a simple example of how you can get data from Yahoo Finance and analyze it using Python. We'll use pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for data visualization.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading involves more complex analysis and risk management.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2021-12-31')

# Calculate the moving average
data['MA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(50).mean()
data['MA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(200).mean()

# Plotting the data
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='AAPL')
plt.plot(data['MA_50'], label='MA 50 days')
plt.plot(data['MA_200'], label='MA 200 days')
plt.title('Apple Stock Price')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price ($)')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Identifying potential profitable trades
# A common strategy is to buy when the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA and sell when it crosses below
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['MA_50'] > data['MA_200']) & (data['MA_50'].shift(1) < data['MA_200'].shift(1))
data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['MA_50'] < data['MA_200']) & (data['MA_50'].shift(1) > data['MA_200'].shift(1))

buy_signals = data[data['Buy_Signal']]
sell_signals = data[data['Sell_Signal']]

print("Potential Buy Signals:")
print(buy_signals)
print("\nPotential Sell Signals:")
print(sell_signals)
```

This script downloads the historical data for Apple's stock, calculates the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and plots the stock price along with these moving averages. It then identifies potential buy and sell signals based on these moving averages. 

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and should not be used for real trading without further enhancements and risk management.
