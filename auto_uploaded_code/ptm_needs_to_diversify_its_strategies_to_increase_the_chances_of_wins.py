To diversify the strategies, we can create a Python code that implements different trading strategies. Here is a simple example of how this can be done:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('trading_data.csv')

# Define the features and the target
features = data.drop('target', axis=1)
target = data['target']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
features_train, features_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define the strategies
strategies = {
    'RandomForest': RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100),
    # Add more strategies here
}

# Train and test each strategy
for name, model in strategies.items():
    model.fit(features_train, target_train)
    score = model.score(features_test, target_test)
    print(f'{name} strategy accuracy: {score * 100}%')
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to carefully choose and tune your strategies, preprocess your data, handle missing values, etc. Also, you would need to have a trading_data.csv file which contains your trading data.

The strategies dictionary can be expanded to include more machine learning models, each representing a different trading strategy. For example, you could add a Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Decision Tree, a Neural Network, etc.
