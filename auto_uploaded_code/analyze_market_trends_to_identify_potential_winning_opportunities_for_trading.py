Analyzing market trends involves complex algorithms and requires historical market data. Here's a basic example of how you might use Python to analyze market trends using a simple moving average strategy. This example uses the pandas library for data manipulation and yfinance to download stock price data.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading involves many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'
ticker_data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2021-12-31')

# Calculate the short-window simple moving average
short_rolling = ticker_data.rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-window simple moving average
long_rolling = ticker_data.rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create signals
signals = pd.DataFrame(index=ticker_data.index)
signals['signal'] = 0.0
signals['short_mavg'] = short_rolling['Close']
signals['long_mavg'] = long_rolling['Close']

# Generate trading signals (buy=1 , sell=-1)
signals['signal'][short_rolling['Close'] > long_rolling['Close']] = 1.0
signals['signal'][short_rolling['Close'] < long_rolling['Close']] = -1.0

# Print the signals
print(signals)
```

This script downloads historical data for Apple's stock, calculates a short-window (20 days) and long-window (100 days) simple moving average, and generates trading signals based on the crossover strategy: when the short moving average is higher than the long moving average, it's a buy signal (1), and when it's lower, it's a sell signal (-1).

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world trading involves many more factors. Always do thorough research and consider multiple factors before making trading decisions.
