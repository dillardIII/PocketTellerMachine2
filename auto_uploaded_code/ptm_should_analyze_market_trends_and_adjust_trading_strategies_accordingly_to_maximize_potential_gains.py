To analyze market trends and adjust trading strategies, we need to use some kind of machine learning or data analysis techniques. Here is a simple example of how you might use Python's pandas library to analyze market trends. For the trading strategies, let's assume that we will buy when the trend is going up and sell when the trend is going down.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real trading strategies would be much more complex and consider many other factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def analyze_trends(data):
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(np.arange(len(data)).reshape(-1, 1), data)
    trend = model.coef_[0]
    return trend

def adjust_strategy(trend, budget, prices):
    if trend > 0:
        # Buy
        num_stocks = budget // prices[-1]
        budget -= num_stocks * prices[-1]
    else:
        # Sell
        num_stocks = 0
    return num_stocks, budget

# Example usage:
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')  # assuming you have market data in a CSV file
prices = data['Price'].values
trend = analyze_trends(prices)
num_stocks, budget = adjust_strategy(trend, 10000, prices)  # assuming you start with a budget of $10,000
print(f'Number of stocks: {num_stocks}, Remaining budget: {budget}')
```

This code first defines a function to analyze market trends by fitting a linear regression model to the price data. The trend is determined by the slope of the fitted line. If the slope is positive, the trend is going up, and if it's negative, the trend is going down.

Then it defines a function to adjust the trading strategy based on the trend. If the trend is going up, it buys as many stocks as possible with the current budget. If the trend is going down, it sells all stocks.

Finally, it reads market data from a CSV file, analyzes the trend, and adjusts the trading strategy accordingly. The remaining budget after buying or selling stocks is printed out.
