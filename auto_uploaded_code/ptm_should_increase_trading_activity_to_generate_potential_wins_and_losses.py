To increase trading activity, we could create a Python script that uses an algorithm to make trades. Here's a simple example using a random trading strategy. This is a very simplified example and real trading algorithms would be much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import random
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance):
        self.balance = initial_balance
        self.stocks = 0

    def trade(self, price):
        # Randomly decide to buy, sell, or hold
        decision = random.choice(['buy', 'sell', 'hold'])

        if decision == 'buy' and self.balance > price:
            self.stocks += 1
            self.balance -= price
        elif decision == 'sell' and self.stocks > 0:
            self.stocks -= 1
            self.balance += price

    def get_value(self, price):
        return self.balance + self.stocks * price

def simulate_trading(ptm, prices):
    for price in prices:
        ptm.trade(price)

    return ptm.get_value(prices[-1])

# Get historical data for a stock
data = pdr.get_data_yahoo('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2020-12-31')
prices = data['Close']

ptm = PTM(10000)
final_value = simulate_trading(ptm, prices)

print(f'Final value: ${final_value}')
```

This script creates a PTM (Potential Trading Machine) that can buy, sell, or hold a stock at each price in a series of prices. It then simulates trading over a year of historical data for Apple's stock. The final value of the PTM's assets (cash balance plus the value of any stocks it owns) is then printed out.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real trading algorithms would be much more complex and take into account many more factors. Also, this code uses the `pandas_datareader` library to fetch historical stock data, which may not be available in all environments.
