To increase trading activity, we can create a Python script that will automate the trading process. This script will randomly decide whether to buy or sell based on a simple algorithm. The results of these trades will be recorded for analysis. 

Please note that this is a very basic script and does not take into account many factors that would be important in real-world trading. 

```python
import random
import pandas as pd

# Define the initial amount of money and the price of the stock
money = 10000
stock_price = 100
stocks_owned = 0

# Create a DataFrame to store the results of each trade
trade_results = pd.DataFrame(columns=['Action', 'Stock Price', 'Stocks Owned', 'Money'])

# Run the trading algorithm for 100 iterations
for i in range(100):
    # Randomly decide whether to buy or sell
    action = random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])
    
    if action == 'buy':
        # Buy as many stocks as possible
        stocks_to_buy = money // stock_price
        money -= stocks_to_buy * stock_price
        stocks_owned += stocks_to_buy
    elif action == 'sell' and stocks_owned > 0:
        # Sell all stocks
        money += stocks_owned * stock_price
        stocks_owned = 0
    
    # Record the results of the trade
    trade_results = trade_results.append({'Action': action, 'Stock Price': stock_price, 'Stocks Owned': stocks_owned, 'Money': money}, ignore_index=True)
    
    # Randomly change the stock price
    stock_price += random.uniform(-1, 1)

# Print the final amount of money and stocks
print('Final Money:', money)
print('Final Stocks:', stocks_owned)

# Print the trade results
print(trade_results)
```

This script will increase trading activity by making a trade at each iteration of the loop. The results of these trades are recorded in a DataFrame for analysis. The stock price changes randomly at each iteration to simulate market fluctuations.
