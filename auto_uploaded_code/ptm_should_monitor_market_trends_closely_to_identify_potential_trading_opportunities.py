To monitor market trends and identify potential trading opportunities, we can use Python libraries like pandas, yfinance, and matplotlib. Here's a simple script that fetches the latest stock data from Yahoo Finance, calculates the moving averages, and plots the data to visualize market trends.

Please note that this is a basic script and real-world trading systems are much more complex and take into account many other factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def calculate_moving_average(data, window_size):
    return data['Close'].rolling(window=window_size).mean()

def plot_data(stock_data, short_moving_avg, long_moving_avg):
    plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.plot(stock_data['Close'],label='Closing Price')
    plt.plot(short_moving_avg, label='Short Moving Average')
    plt.plot(long_moving_avg, label='Long Moving Average')
    plt.legend(loc=2)
    plt.show()

def monitor_market_trends(stock_symbol, short_window, long_window):
    # Fetch stock data
    stock_data = yf.download(stock_symbol,start='2020-01-01',end='2022-12-31')

    # Calculate moving averages
    short_moving_avg = calculate_moving_average(stock_data, short_window)
    long_moving_avg = calculate_moving_average(stock_data, long_window)

    # Plot data
    plot_data(stock_data, short_moving_avg, long_moving_avg)

# Monitor market trends for Apple Inc.
monitor_market_trends('AAPL', 20, 50)
```

This script fetches the stock data for Apple Inc. ('AAPL') and calculates the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. It then plots the closing price, short moving average, and long moving average.

You can replace 'AAPL' with the symbol of any other stock you want to monitor. The short_window and long_window parameters define the window sizes for the short and long moving averages, respectively. You can adjust these parameters based on your trading strategy.
