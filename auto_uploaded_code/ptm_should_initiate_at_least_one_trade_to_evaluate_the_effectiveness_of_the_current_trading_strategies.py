To initiate a trade, we can use a simple Python script. However, please note that this is a simplified version and in real-world applications, you would need to use an API provided by your brokerage or trading platform. 

Here's an example of how you could do it:

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, symbol, quantity, trade_type):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.trade_type = trade_type

    def execute_trade(self):
        print(f"Executing {self.trade_type} trade for {self.quantity} of {self.symbol}")

# Create a trade
trade = Trade("AAPL", 100, "buy")

# Execute the trade
trade.execute_trade()
```

This code defines a `Trade` class with a method to execute a trade. It then creates a trade (buying 100 shares of AAPL) and executes it. 

In a real-world scenario, the `execute_trade` method would need to interact with your brokerage's trading API to actually place the trade. The effectiveness of the trading strategy could then be evaluated by comparing the performance of the executed trades against some benchmark.
