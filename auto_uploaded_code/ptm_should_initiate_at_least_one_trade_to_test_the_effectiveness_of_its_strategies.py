Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade. This code uses a hypothetical trading API, so it's not functional. It's just an example to show how such a system might be structured.

```python
import random
import time

class TradeAPI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # hypothetical initial balance

    def get_price(self, symbol):
        # In a real system, this would fetch the current price of a stock or other asset
        # Here we just return a random value
        return random.uniform(10.0, 200.0)

    def execute_trade(self, symbol, quantity, price):
        cost = quantity * price
        if cost > self.balance:
            return False
        self.balance -= cost
        print(f"Executed trade: Bought {quantity} of {symbol} at {price}")
        return True

# Create a trading API instance
api = TradeAPI()

# Define the trading strategy
def strategy(api):
    symbol = "PTM"  # the asset to trade
    quantity = 1  # the quantity to buy

    # Fetch the current price
    price = api.get_price(symbol)

    # Execute the trade
    success = api.execute_trade(symbol, quantity, price)

    if success:
        print(f"Trade successful! New balance: {api.balance}")
    else:
        print("Trade failed due to insufficient balance")

# Test the strategy
strategy(api)
```

This script creates a simple trading system that buys a single unit of "PTM" asset. The price of the asset is randomly generated. The trade is executed if the balance is sufficient. After the trade, the new balance is printed.
