Sure, I can provide a basic example of how you might initiate a trade using a Python library like `alpaca-trade-api` which is a REST API for stock trading. Please replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your actual API keys.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API connection
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Get account information
account = api.get_account()
print(account)

# Check if our account is restricted from trading.
if account.trading_blocked:
    print('Account is currently restricted from trading.')

# Check how much money we have to work with.
print('${} is available as cash'.format(account.cash))

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code first establishes a connection to the Alpaca API, then checks if the account is restricted from trading. If it's not, it prints the amount of cash available in the account. Finally, it submits a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock.

Please note that this is a very basic example and doesn't include any trading strategy. It's recommended to use a more advanced strategy for real trading. Also, remember that trading involves risks and you should only trade with money you can afford to lose.
