Sure, here is a simple Python code to simulate a trade execution. 

This code does not involve real money or real stocks, it's just a simulation for educational purposes. We will use a random choice from a list of stocks for the simulation.

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, stocks):
        self.stocks = stocks

    def execute_trade(self):
        # Randomly choose a stock to trade
        stock_to_trade = random.choice(self.stocks)
        print(f"Trade executed for {stock_to_trade}")

# List of stocks
stocks = ["AAPL", "GOOGL", "AMZN", "MSFT", "TSLA"]

# Create a Trade object
ptm = Trade(stocks)

# Execute a trade
ptm.execute_trade()
```

When you run this code, it will randomly choose a stock from the list and print a message saying that a trade has been executed for that stock.

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, trading involves buying or selling stocks, considering stock prices, market conditions, and many other factors. 

Also, remember that trading in the stock market involves risk, and you should only trade with money that you can afford to lose. Always do your research or consult with a financial advisor before making trading decisions.
