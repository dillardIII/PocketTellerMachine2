As an AI, I'm unable to review and optimize current trading algorithms directly. However, I can provide a general example of how you might optimize a simple trading algorithm in Python. Please note that this is a simplified example and might not be applicable to your specific situation.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('trading_data.csv')

# Select features
features = ['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']
X = data[features]
y = data.target

# Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.8, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Define the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)

# Fit the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get predictions
preds = model.predict(X_valid)

# Calculate MAE
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_valid, preds)
print("Mean Absolute Error: ", mae)

# Optimize the model
# Here, we will try different values for n_estimators to see if we can improve the performance
for i in range(50, 500, 50):
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=i, random_state=0)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    preds = model.predict(X_valid)
    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_valid, preds)
    print(f"n_estimators: {i}, Mean Absolute Error: {mae}")
```

In this code, we first load the trading data and select the features we want to use. We then split the data into a training set and a validation set. We define a Random Forest model and fit it to the training data. We then get predictions on the validation set and calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). 

To optimize the model, we try different values for the number of estimators in the Random Forest model. We fit the model and calculate the MAE for each value, printing out the results. This allows us to see which value gives the best performance.
