Here is a simple Python code to simulate a trade. This code uses the yfinance library to fetch real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance:

```python
import yfinance as yf

def initiate_trade(stock_symbol, trade_volume):
    # Fetch stock data
    stock = yf.Ticker(stock_symbol)

    # Get the current price
    current_price = stock.info['regularMarketPrice']

    # Calculate the total cost of the trade
    total_cost = current_price * trade_volume

    print(f"Initiated a trade for {trade_volume} shares of {stock_symbol} at {current_price} per share.")
    print(f"Total cost of the trade: {total_cost}")

# Example: Initiate a trade for 10 shares of Apple Inc.
initiate_trade('AAPL', 10)
```

Please note that this code only simulates a trade and doesn't actually perform any real transactions. To perform real trades, you would need to use a trading API like Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, etc. and you would need to handle authentication, risk management, and other important aspects of trading.

Also, please be aware that trading involves risk and it's possible to lose money. Always make sure to understand the risks involved and consider your financial situation before trading.
