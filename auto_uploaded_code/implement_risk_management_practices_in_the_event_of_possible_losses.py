Sure, we can implement risk management in a trading system by setting stop-loss orders and take-profit levels. Stop-loss order is an order to sell a security when it reaches a certain price and is designed to limit an investor's loss on a trading position. Take-profit level on the other hand is the price at which we plan on closing the active position aiming for profit.

Here's a simple example:

```python
class RiskManagement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000    # Initial balance
        self.stop_loss = 0.1    # 10%
        self.take_profit = 0.2  # 20%

    def place_order(self, buy_price, quantity):
        # Calculate total amount of investment
        amount = buy_price * quantity

        # Confirm the user has enough balance before entering a position
        if amount > self.balance:
            return "You can't place this order due to insufficient balance."

        self.balance -= amount
        return self.manage_risk(buy_price, quantity, amount)

    def manage_risk(self, buy_price, quantity, amount):
        # Setting up hardcoded stop-loss and take-profit levels
        stop_loss_level = buy_price * (1 - self.stop_loss)
        take_profit_level = buy_price * (1 + self.take_profit)

        # Imagine this while loop is replaced with real market data
        while True:
            # Replace 'current_market_price'  with real-time market data
            current_market_price = get_real_time_price()

            # If current price is lower than stop_loss level then sell and cut losses
            if current_market_price <= stop_loss_level:
                self.sell(quantity, current_market_price)
                return "Sold at Stop-Loss."

            # If price reaches take-profit level then sell and take the profits
            elif current_market_price >= take_profit_level:
                self.sell(quantity, current_market_price)
                return "Sold at Take-Profit."

    def sell(self, quantity, sell_price):
        # Calculate Sale Proceeds
        amount = sell_price * quantity

        # Update Balance
        self.balance += amount
```

Please note:
1. For simplicity, I have not included the module which fetches real-time price, hence the function 'get_real_time_price()' is just a placeholder for actual market data.
2. Always check with the relevant market regulations regarding auto-trading.
3. Also, to implement the infinite loop, real time trading is necessary. I can't provide real market time data due to its complexity beyond this AI's capabilities. So, I have left an 'while' loop for the placeholder. You would need to replace that with real scenario.
4. Code does not include any commission and leverage, make sure you calculate them in real trading scenario.
