Sure, I can help you write a simple Python code to simulate a trade initiation. However, please note that in real-life scenarios, trading involves complex algorithms, real-time data analysis, and it's usually done through APIs provided by trading platforms.

Here's a simple Python code to simulate a trade initiation:

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, ticker, volume, trade_type):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.volume = volume
        self.trade_type = trade_type

    def execute_trade(self):
        print(f"Executing {self.trade_type} trade for {self.volume} of {self.ticker}")

# Initiate a trade
ptm_trade = Trade("AAPL", 100, "buy")
ptm_trade.execute_trade()
```

In this code, we create a `Trade` class with `ticker` (the stock symbol), `volume` (number of shares), and `trade_type` (buy or sell) as attributes. The `execute_trade` method is used to simulate the execution of the trade.

We then create an instance of the `Trade` class for PTM, specifying "AAPL" as the stock, 100 as the volume, and "buy" as the trade type. The `execute_trade` method is then called to simulate the execution of the trade.

Please replace "AAPL", 100, and "buy" with the actual stock symbol, volume, and trade type you wish to trade.
