Here is a simple Python code example using the Alpaca API to initiate a trade. This code will buy 1 share of Apple stock. Please replace 'APCA-API-KEY-ID' and 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY' with your actual Alpaca API keys.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API connection
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code will initiate a trade and gather data about the market's behavior. The 'gtc' (good-till-cancelled) parameter means the order will stay open until it is filled.

Please note that this is a basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle exceptions and make sure you have enough funds in your account before placing a trade. You would also need to analyze the market data you gather to make informed trading decisions.
