To analyze the performance of a trading strategy, you might consider factors such as the profit and loss, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown. Below is a basic python code using `pandas`, `numpy`, `yfinance` (Yahoo Finance) and `pyfolio` libraries. Please note that you will need actual trading signals to perform a real analysis.

First, you need to install these libraries if you haven't done so before.
```python
pip install pandas numpy yfinance pyfolio
```

```python
# python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
import pyfolio as pf

def evaluate_strategy():
    # Download historical data as dataframe
    data = yf.download('PTM', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')
   
    # Assume the strategy is to buy when previous close is greater than the open
    # Signal = 1 for buy and 0 for hold
    data['Signal'] = np.where(data['Close'].shift() > data['Open'], 1, 0)
    
    # Calculate returns from strategy
    data['Strat_return'] = data['Signal'].shift() * data['Close'].pct_change()
    
    # Calculate cumulative returns of the strategy
    data['Cumulative_Strat_return'] = (1 + data['Strat_return']).cumprod()
    
    # Print net returns from the strategy
    print('Net strategy return:', data['Cumulative_Strat_return'][-1])

    # Create a tear sheet to analyze strategy's risk and returns.
    pf.create_returns_tear_sheet(data['Strat_return'])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    evaluate_strategy() 
```

Remember this script is basic and requires additional data such as trading signals to analyze real trading strategies. It's making an assumption for the trading signal. You should replace that with the actual trading signal to evaluate the model correctly. This code aims to illustrate how one might evaluate a strategy using Python, but each trading strategy requires a unique set of considerations and methods for evaluation.
