To analyze market trends and adjust trading parameters, we would need historical market data. This data could be obtained from various sources like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, etc. However, due to the limitations, I am unable to provide a specific API to fetch the data. 

Here is a simple example of how you could analyze market trends using Python's pandas library and adjust trading parameters. In this example, we'll use a simple moving average strategy. If the current price is greater than the moving average, we'll set the trading parameter to 'Buy'. If it's less, we'll set it to 'Sell'.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world trading strategies are much more complex.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load your market data into a pandas DataFrame
# df = pd.read_csv('your_market_data.csv')

# Calculate the moving average
df['Moving Average'] = df['Price'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Create a function to determine the trading parameters
def adjust_trading_parameters(row):
    if row['Price'] > row['Moving Average']:
        return 'Buy'
    elif row['Price'] < row['Moving Average']:
        return 'Sell'
    else:
        return 'Hold'

# Apply the function to the DataFrame
df['Trading Parameters'] = df.apply(adjust_trading_parameters, axis=1)

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```

In this code, replace 'your_market_data.csv' with the path to your market data file. The 'Price' column should contain the price data that you want to analyze. The moving average window is set to 20, but you can adjust this to fit your specific strategy.

This code will add a new column to your DataFrame, 'Trading Parameters', which will contain the adjusted trading parameters based on the market trends.
