Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade using a hypothetical API. Please note that this is just a simulation and won't actually initiate a trade in real market.

```python
import requests

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, base_url, api_key):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.api_key = api_key

    def initiate_trade(self, symbol, qty, side, type, time_in_force):
        url = f"{self.base_url}/v2/orders"
        headers = {
            "APCA-API-KEY-ID": self.api_key,
        }
        data = {
            "symbol": symbol,
            "qty": qty,
            "side": side,
            "type": type,
            "time_in_force": time_in_force,
        }
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
        return response.json()

# Initialize PTM
ptm = PTM(base_url="https://paper-api.alpaca.markets", api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Initiate a trade
trade_response = ptm.initiate_trade(symbol="AAPL", qty=1, side="buy", type="market", time_in_force="gtc")

print(trade_response)
```

In this code, we're creating a `PTM` class that has a method `initiate_trade` to initiate a trade. We're using the `requests` library to send a POST request to the trading API. The `initiate_trade` method takes in parameters like `symbol` (stock symbol), `qty` (quantity), `side` (buy or sell), `type` (market or limit), and `time_in_force` (good till cancelled or day).

Please replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual API key. Also, this code assumes that you're using the Alpaca's paper trading API. If you're using a different API, you might need to adjust the code accordingly.

Please note that trading involves risk, and this code does not include any risk management strategies. It's important to understand the risks involved and to use appropriate risk management strategies when trading.
