Sure, here's a simple Python code using the `alpaca-trade-api` package to initiate a trade. Please replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your own Alpaca API Key ID and Secret Key.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

def initiate_trade(symbol, qty, side, type, time_in_force):
    try:
        api.submit_order(
            symbol=symbol,
            qty=qty,
            side=side,
            type=type,
            time_in_force=time_in_force
        )
        print(f"Successfully initiated {side} order for {qty} shares of {symbol}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while initiating the trade: {str(e)}")

# Initiate a trade
initiate_trade('AAPL', 1, 'buy', 'market', 'gtc')
```

This code initiates a trade using the Alpaca API. The `initiate_trade` function submits an order to buy 1 share of Apple Inc. (AAPL) at the market price. The order is a 'good till cancelled' (gtc) order, which means it will remain active until it is manually cancelled.

Please note that this is a paper trading API URL which means it's for testing and won't execute real trades. Replace the URL with the live trading URL provided by Alpaca to execute real trades.

Also, remember to install the `alpaca-trade-api` package using pip:

```bash
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Please ensure you understand the implications and risks of executing trades in a live environment.
