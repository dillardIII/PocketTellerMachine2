Sure, here is a simple example of Python code using the pandas library to analyze market trends. This example uses a simple moving average crossover strategy, which is a common strategy used in trading. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms can be much more complex. Also, this code assumes that you have a CSV file with historical price data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('price_data.csv')

# Calculate moving averages
data['SMA_50'] = data['price'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['price'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Create a column 'Signal' such that if 50-day SMA is greater than 200-day SMA then Signal is 1, else it's 0.
data['Signal'] = 0.0  
data['Signal'] = np.where(data['SMA_50'] > data['SMA_200'], 1.0, 0.0)

# Create a column 'Position' which is the difference of two consecutive 'Signal' to identify the buying/selling signal
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Print the DataFrame
print(data)

# Identify potential profitable trades
# A buy signal is generated when Position column goes from -1 to 1, and sell signal when it goes from 1 to -1.
buy_signals = data[data['Position'] == 1]
sell_signals = data[data['Position'] == -1]

print('Potential Buy Signals:\n', buy_signals)
print('Potential Sell Signals:\n', sell_signals)
```

This code is a simple example and does not take into account transaction costs, slippage, risk management, or other important factors for a real trading algorithm. Also, the performance of this strategy has not been tested and it is not recommended to use for real trading without proper backtesting and risk management.
