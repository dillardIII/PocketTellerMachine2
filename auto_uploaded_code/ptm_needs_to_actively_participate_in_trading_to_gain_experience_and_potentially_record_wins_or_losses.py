Sure, to simulate PTM's trading experience, we can create a simple Python program that randomly generates wins or losses for each trade. Here's a simple example:

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.experience = 0
        self.wins = 0
        self.losses = 0

    def trade(self):
        # Randomly decide if the trade is a win or loss
        trade_outcome = random.choice(['win', 'loss'])

        # Update experience and record
        self.experience += 1
        if trade_outcome == 'win':
            self.wins += 1
        else:
            self.losses += 1

        return trade_outcome

# Initialize PTM
ptm = PTM()

# Simulate 100 trades
for _ in range(100):
    outcome = ptm.trade()
    print(f'Trade outcome: {outcome}')

print(f'PTM has completed 100 trades with {ptm.wins} wins and {ptm.losses} losses.')
```

In this code, we create a `PTM` class that has methods for trading. The `trade` method randomly decides if a trade is a win or a loss, and updates the PTM's experience and record accordingly. We then simulate 100 trades and print the outcome of each one. At the end, we print the total number of wins and losses.
