Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code that simulates a trade. In this case, I'll use a fictional stock trading API. Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading involves more complexity.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # Starting balance
        self.stocks = {}  # Owned stocks

    def get_stock_price(self, stock):
        # This is a mock function, in real-world you would use an API to get the real stock price
        return random.randint(10, 200)

    def buy_stock(self, stock, amount):
        price = self.get_stock_price(stock)
        total_price = price * amount

        if total_price > self.balance:
            print("Not enough balance to complete the trade.")
            return

        self.balance -= total_price
        self.stocks[stock] = self.stocks.get(stock, 0) + amount
        print(f"Bought {amount} of {stock} stock for {total_price}. Remaining balance: {self.balance}")

    def sell_stock(self, stock, amount):
        if stock not in self.stocks or self.stocks[stock] < amount:
            print("Not enough stock to complete the trade.")
            return

        price = self.get_stock_price(stock)
        total_price = price * amount

        self.balance += total_price
        self.stocks[stock] -= amount
        print(f"Sold {amount} of {stock} stock for {total_price}. Remaining balance: {self.balance}")

# Initialize PTM
ptm = PTM()

# Buy 5 stocks of 'AAPL'
ptm.buy_stock('AAPL', 5)

# Sell 3 stocks of 'AAPL'
ptm.sell_stock('AAPL', 3)
```

In this code, we create a PTM class that has methods to buy and sell stocks. The `get_stock_price` method is a mock function that returns a random price for a stock. In a real-world scenario, you would use an API to get the actual price of a stock. The `buy_stock` and `sell_stock` methods are used to buy and sell stocks respectively. They check if the trade is possible (enough balance or stock) and then update the balance and owned stocks.
