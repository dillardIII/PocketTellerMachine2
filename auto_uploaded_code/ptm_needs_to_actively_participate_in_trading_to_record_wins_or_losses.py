Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that simulates trading for PTM. In this code, we will simulate trading by generating random wins and losses.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 0

    def trade(self):
        # Simulate win or loss
        win = random.choice([True, False])

        if win:
            # Simulate amount won (between 100 and 500)
            amount = random.randint(100, 500)
            print(f"PTM won ${amount}")
            self.balance += amount
        else:
            # Simulate amount lost (between 50 and 200)
            amount = random.randint(50, 200)
            print(f"PTM lost ${amount}")
            self.balance -= amount

        print(f"Current balance: ${self.balance}")

# Create PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Simulate 10 trades
for _ in range(10):
    ptm.trade()
```

This code creates a PTM class with a `trade` method that simulates a win or loss. The `trade` method randomly decides whether the trade is a win or a loss. If it's a win, it randomly generates an amount between 100 and 500 and adds it to the balance. If it's a loss, it randomly generates an amount between 50 and 200 and subtracts it from the balance. The current balance is printed after each trade.

The code then creates an instance of the PTM class and simulates 10 trades.

Please note that this is a very basic simulation and doesn't take into account many factors that would be present in real trading.
