As an AI, I can't directly conduct a review of market trends and opportunities. However, I can provide you with a Python script that uses the yfinance library to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance, which you can then analyze to identify potential trades. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading involves many more factors. Also, this script doesn't predict future prices, it only downloads historical data.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Define the ticker list
tickers_list = ['AAPL', 'WMT', 'IBM', 'GOOG', 'BP']

# Fetch the data
def fetch_data(tickers_list):
    data = pd.DataFrame(columns=tickers_list)
    for ticker in tickers_list:
        data[ticker] = yf.download(ticker,'2020-01-01','2022-12-31')['Adj Close']
    return data

# Print data
data = fetch_data(tickers_list)
print(data)
```

This script fetches the adjusted closing prices for the specified tickers (in this case, AAPL, WMT, IBM, GOOG, and BP) for the period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022. 

You can then analyze this data to identify market trends and opportunities. For example, you might look for stocks that have been steadily increasing in price, or you might look for stocks that have recently dropped in price and might be a good buying opportunity.

Please install the necessary libraries by using the following commands if not already installed:
```
pip install yfinance
pip install pandas
```
