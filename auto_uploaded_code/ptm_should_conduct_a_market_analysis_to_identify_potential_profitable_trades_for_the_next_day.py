To conduct a market analysis, we would need to fetch market data, analyze it, and identify potential profitable trades. Here's a simple Python script that uses the `yfinance` library to fetch stock data and `pandas` for data analysis. 

Please note that this is a very basic script and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and involve many more factors.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Define the list of stocks we are interested in
stocks = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'FB']

# Fetch historical market data
data = yf.download(stocks, start='2021-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate daily returns
data['Daily Return'] = data['Adj Close'].pct_change()

# Identify potential profitable trades
# Here, we simply identify days where the daily return was greater than 2%
profitable_trades = data[data['Daily Return'] > 0.02]

print(profitable_trades)
```

This script fetches historical data for the stocks we are interested in, calculates the daily return (which is the percentage change in the adjusted closing price from the previous day), and identifies days where the daily return was greater than 2%.

Please note that this is a very simplistic analysis and should not be used for actual trading. Real-world trading algorithms take into account many more factors and use much more sophisticated methods for identifying profitable trades.
