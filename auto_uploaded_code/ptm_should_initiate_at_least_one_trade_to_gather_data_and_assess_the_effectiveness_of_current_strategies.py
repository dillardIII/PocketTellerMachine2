Sure, here is a simple example of how you could initiate a trade using Python. This example uses the `yfinance` library to fetch stock data and the `alpaca_trade_api` library to initiate the trade. Please replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your actual Alpaca API keys.

```python
import yfinance as yf
from alpaca_trade_api import REST

# Define Alpaca API
api = REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Define the stock to trade
stock = 'AAPL'

# Fetch current price
data = yf.download(stock, period='1d', interval='1m')
current_price = data['Close'][-1]

# Define trade parameters
qty = 1
side = 'buy'
type = 'limit'
time_in_force = 'gtc'
limit_price = current_price

# Initiate the trade
api.submit_order(
    symbol=stock,
    qty=qty,
    side=side,
    type=type,
    time_in_force=time_in_force,
    limit_price=limit_price
)
```

This code will initiate a limit order to buy 1 share of Apple at the current price. The order is 'good till cancelled' (gtc), meaning it will stay open until it is filled or cancelled.

Please note that this is a very basic example and does not include any strategy assessment. You would need to add additional code to track the performance of this trade and assess the effectiveness of your strategy. Also, remember that trading involves risk and you should only trade with money you can afford to lose.
