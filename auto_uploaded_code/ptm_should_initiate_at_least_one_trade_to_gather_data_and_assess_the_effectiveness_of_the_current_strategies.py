To initiate a trade and gather data to assess the effectiveness of the current strategies, we would need to interact with a trading API. Here is a simple example of how you might do this using the Alpaca API, a popular choice for algorithmic trading. 

Firstly, you need to install the Alpaca API. You can do this using pip:

```python
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Then you can use the following code to initiate a trade:

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Replace these with your API connection info from the dashboard
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock. 

Please replace '<APCA-API-KEY-ID>' and '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>' with your own Alpaca API key ID and secret key.

After the trade, you can gather data on the trade like this:

```python
# Get our account information.
account = api.get_account()

# Check if our account is restricted from trading.
if account.trading_blocked:
    print('Account is currently restricted from trading.')

# Check how much money we can use to buy new assets.
print('${} is available as buying power.'.format(account.buying_power))

# Get a list of all of our positions.
portfolio = api.list_positions()

# Print the quantity of shares for each position.
for position in portfolio:
    print("{} shares of {}".format(position.qty, position.symbol))
```

This code will print out the account information, including the buying power and the quantity of shares for each position.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading involves much more considerations, such as risk management, strategy selection, etc.
