Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code for a trading strategy. This example uses a simple moving average crossover strategy. This strategy is not guaranteed to increase trading activity or profitability and is just an example. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    sma = data.rolling(window=window).mean()
    return sma

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    ema = data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()
    return ema

def trading_strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    # Calculate the short and long window simple moving averages
    data['short_sma'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], short_window)
    data['long_sma'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], long_window)

    # Create a column 'Signal' such that if the short window SMA is greater than long window SMA then buy else sell
    data['Signal'] = 0.0  
    data['Signal'][short_window:] = np.where(data['short_sma'][short_window:] > data['long_sma'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   

    # Generate trading orders
    data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

    return data

# Fetch the data
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = web.DataReader(ticker, 'yahoo', start='01/01/2010', end='01/01/2022')

# Implement the strategy
short_window = 40
long_window = 100
trading_data = trading_strategy(data, short_window, long_window)

# Print the data
print(trading_data)
```

In this code, we first calculate the short and long window simple moving averages (SMA). We then create a 'Signal' column such that if the short window SMA is greater than the long window SMA then we buy (1.0) else we sell (0.0). We then generate trading orders based on the 'Signal' column. If the signal changes (differs from the previous signal), we either buy or sell.

Please note that this is a very simple trading strategy and is not guaranteed to be profitable. It is always recommended to backtest any strategy before live trading. Also, this strategy doesn't take into account transaction costs.
