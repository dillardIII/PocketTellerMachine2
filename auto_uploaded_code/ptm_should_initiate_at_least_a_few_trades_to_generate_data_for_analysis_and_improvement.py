Sure, I can provide you with a simple example of a Python code that simulates trading. In this example, we will use random numbers to simulate the price of a stock and then make trades based on that. Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading involves much more complexity.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cash = 10000
        self.stocks = 0
        self.price = 100

    def trade(self):
        # Simulate price change
        self.price += random.randint(-10, 10)

        # Decide to buy or sell
        if self.price < 90 and self.cash > self.price:
            # Buy
            self.stocks += 1
            self.cash -= self.price
            print(f'Bought one stock at price {self.price}')
        elif self.price > 110 and self.stocks > 0:
            # Sell
            self.stocks -= 1
            self.cash += self.price
            print(f'Sold one stock at price {self.price}')

        print(f'Cash: {self.cash}, Stocks: {self.stocks}, Price: {self.price}')

# Initialize PTM
ptm = PTM()

# Make 100 trades
for _ in range(100):
    ptm.trade()
```

In this code, PTM starts with $10,000 and no stocks. The price of the stock starts at $100 and changes randomly by up to $10 each time a trade is made. If the price drops below $90, PTM buys a stock (if it has enough cash), and if the price rises above $110, PTM sells a stock (if it has any). After each trade, the current cash, stocks, and price are printed.
