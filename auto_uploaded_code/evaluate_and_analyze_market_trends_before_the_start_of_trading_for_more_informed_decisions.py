In order to evaluate and analyze market trends using Python, we'll need to fetch some historical data from a financial market source. We will use the `yfinance` API to fetch stock data of a specific company (for example, Google). Then we use `pandas` to manipulate the data and `matplotlib` to visualize it.
Since it is a broad topic, this application is simple and will do the following:
- Fetching Google's historical data,
- Calculating the Moving Average, which is commonly used to spot trend direction,
- Plotting the prices and the moving average.

Here is a simple Python script to do this:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Fetch historical market data for Google
google = yf.Ticker('GOOGL')
hist = google.history(period='1y')  # get 1 year's data

# Calculate 30-day Moving Average
hist['MA30'] = hist['Close'].rolling(window=30).mean()

# Create a line plot of Close price and the Moving Average
plt.figure(figsize=(14,8))
plt.plot(hist.index, hist['Close'], label='Close price')
plt.plot(hist.index, hist['MA30'], label='30-day Moving Average', color='r')
plt.title('Google (GOOGL) Moving Averages')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price (USD)')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

Please note this is a simple example, analyzing market trends takes into more consideration, such as other statistical measures, using multiple moving averages for different time frames, and other trends analysis techniques.  

Also be advised, investment decisions should never be made based solely on a simple script like this. Considerable knowledge and experience in both the technology and finance field are necessary.
