Creating a Python code that analyzes market trends and adjusts strategies accordingly is a complex task that involves multiple steps and requires a deep understanding of both Python programming and financial markets. Here's a very basic example of how you might start building such a system using Python's pandas library for data analysis and yfinance to download stock price data.

Please note that this is a simplified example and real trading algorithms can be much more complex.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical market data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2021-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA10'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
data['MA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Define a simple strategy
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['MA10'] > data['MA50'])
data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['MA10'] < data['MA50'])

# Print data
print(data)

# Note: This is a very basic trading strategy and is not recommended for real trading.
```

In this code, we first download the historical price data for Apple's stock (AAPL) for the years 2020 and 2021. We then calculate the 10-day and 50-day moving averages of the closing prices. These moving averages are often used in trading to identify trends.

The strategy we define is very simple: we generate a buy signal when the 10-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average (indicating an upward trend), and a sell signal when the 10-day moving average is below the 50-day moving average (indicating a downward trend).

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and is not recommended for real trading. Real trading strategies should take into account many other factors and should be thoroughly backtested before being used.
