In order to analyze market trends and adjust trading parameters, we need to use some sort of machine learning or statistical model. Here is a simple example of how you might use a linear regression model to analyze market trends and adjust trading parameters. 

This example assumes that you have a dataset with historical market data, and that you're using the 'pandas' library to handle your data and 'sklearn' to create the linear regression model.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Assume we're going to use column 'A' to predict column 'B'
X = df['A'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = df['B'].values.reshape(-1,1)

# Split the dataset into a training set and a test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()  
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the model to make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Compare the actual output values for X_test with the predicted values
df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test.flatten(), 'Predicted': y_pred.flatten()})

# If the model is good, the actual values should be close to the predicted ones
print(df)

# Now, you can use this model to adjust your trading parameters
# For example, if the model predicts that the market trend is going up, you might want to buy more
# If the model predicts that the market trend is going down, you might want to sell
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In reality, market prediction is a complex task that involves analyzing multiple variables. You might want to use more sophisticated models, such as time series analysis, ARIMA, or LSTM neural networks. You might also want to take into account other factors, such as news events or social media sentiment.
