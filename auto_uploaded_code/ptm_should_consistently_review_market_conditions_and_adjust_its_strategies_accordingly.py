Since you are asking for Python code, I'll assume that PTM is a trading bot implemented in Python. However, the task is quite broad, as 'reviewing market conditions' can entail many things, depending on which market data we should review, which trading strategies we should adjust, and how we should adjust them. Here's a basic outline of how it might work:

Remember, to connect with most trading platforms and gain access to real-time market data, we would typically use their provided API. Depending on the platform you are using, you'll need to find the specific API documentation to understand how to connect and use it properly.

```python
import requests
import time

class TradingBot:
    def __init__(self, base_url, api_key, api_secret):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.api_secret = api_secret
        self.current_strategy = 'default'
        self.headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}

    def get_market_data(self):
        # Fetch current market data (depends on the specific API)
        response = requests.get(self.base_url + '/marketdata', headers=self.headers)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            return data
        else:
            raise Exception('Cannot get market data')

    def adjust_strategy(self, market_data):
        # Adjust trading strategy based on market data
        # This is a too general task, it can involve numerous factors and data analysis
        # For simplicity let's change strategy based on market trend
        if market_data['trend'] == 'up':
            self.current_strategy = 'aggressive'
        elif market_data['trend'] == 'down':
            self.current_strategy = 'conservative'
        else:
            self.current_strategy = 'diversified'
            
        print(f'Strategy adjusted to {self.current_strategy} based on the market data')

    def run(self):
        while True:
            data = self.get_market_data()
            self.adjust_strategy(data)
            # The bot should sleep for a while before running again to avoid hitting request rate limits (depends on the platform)
            time.sleep(60)

bot = TradingBot(base_url='http://api.trading_platform.com', api_key='your_api_key', api_secret='your_api_secret')
bot.run()
```

This code creates an instance of a trading bot that fetches market data every minute and adjusts its strategy based on the received data. 

Please note the task asks the trading assistant to review market conditions and adjust strategies, but without further instruction, it isn't clear how the trading assistant should specifically accomplish this. The provided code is a simple example where, based on an upward or downward trend, the strategy would shift between 'aggressive', 'conservative' and 'diversified'. 

Also, please replace `'http://api.trading_platform.com'`, `'your_api_key'`, and `'your_api_secret'` with real API requests to get and put data depending on the trading platforms you are using. Also, note that the argument for `base_url` should be the base URL of the trading platform's API. API keys and secrets are typically generated through the trading platform itself. 

In a real-world scenario, the `adjust_strategy` method would likely involve complex algorithmic decision-making based on the analysis of the fetched market data.
