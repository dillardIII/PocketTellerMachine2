To analyze market trends and adjust the trading approach accordingly, we can use Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computations, matplotlib for visualizations and sklearn for machine learning tasks. Here is a simple example of how you can analyze market trends using moving averages and adjust trading approach:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load market data
# Assuming 'Date' and 'Close' columns exist
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA10'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
data['MA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a 'Signal' column
data['Signal'] = 0.0  
data['Signal'][data['MA10'] > data['MA50']] = 1.0

# Create a 'Position' column
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price', color='blue')
plt.plot(data['MA10'], label='Moving Average 10 Days', color='red')
plt.plot(data['MA50'], label='Moving Average 50 Days', color='green')
plt.plot(data.loc[data.Position == 1.0].index, data.MA10[data.Position == 1.0], '^', markersize=10, color='m')
plt.plot(data.loc[data.Position == -1.0].index, data.MA10[data.Position == -1.0], 'v', markersize=10, color='k')
plt.title('Market Trends')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Adjust trading approach based on moving averages
buy_dates = data.loc[data.Position == 1.0].index.tolist()
sell_dates = data.loc[data.Position == -1.0].index.tolist()

print("Buy Dates: ", buy_dates)
print("Sell Dates: ", sell_dates)
```

This script calculates 10-day and 50-day moving averages and generates trading signals based on these averages. When the 10-day average is above the 50-day average, it's a buy signal (the market trend is going up), and when it's below, it's a sell signal (the market trend is going down). The script then plots the closing prices and moving averages, marking the buy and sell signals on the plot.

Please note that this is a very basic approach to market trend analysis and trading. In a real-world scenario, you would need a more sophisticated model that considers more factors and uses advanced machine learning or deep learning techniques.
