Analyzing market trends and patterns is a complex task that involves machine learning and data analysis. Here's a simple example of how you might start to approach this problem using Python. This example uses the pandas library to handle data and the yfinance library to fetch stock market data.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world stock market analysis would require a much more complex approach, including machine learning algorithms and a lot more data preprocessing.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn import metrics

# Fetch data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['SMA_10'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
data['SMA_20'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate Bollinger Bands
data['UpperBB'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean() + 2*data['Close'].rolling(window=20).std()
data['LowerBB'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean() - 2*data['Close'].rolling(window=20).std()

# Drop the missing value rows
data = data.dropna()

# Define features and target
features = data[['SMA_10', 'SMA_20', 'UpperBB', 'LowerBB']]
target = data['Close']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
features_train, features_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2)

# Create and train the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(features_train, target_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(features_test)

# Evaluate the model
print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(target_test, predictions))
print('Mean Squared Error:', metrics.mean_squared_error(target_test, predictions))
print('Root Mean Squared Error:', np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(target_test, predictions)))
```

This script downloads historical data for Apple (AAPL), calculates some common technical indicators (moving averages and Bollinger Bands), and uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict the closing price based on these indicators. The model's performance is then evaluated using mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error.
