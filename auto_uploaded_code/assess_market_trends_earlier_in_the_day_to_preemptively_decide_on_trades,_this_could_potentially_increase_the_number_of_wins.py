To complete this task, a machine learning model can be built to analyze market trends and make predictions for future trades. Predictive models like these require historical data in order to be trained. For the purpose of simplicity, let's assume that we already have data collected.

Firstly you will need to load and preprocess this data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Preprocess data
data.dropna(inplace=True)
data = pd.get_dummies(data)

x = data.drop('market_trend', axis=1)
y = data['market_trend']

x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

Then create RandomForest model:

```python
# Create a model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train)
```

After training the model, you can now use it to predict upcoming market trends:

```python
# Predict market trends
predictions = model.predict(x_test)

# Check the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)

print(f"The accuracy of the model is {accuracy*100}%")
```

This model uses RandomForest which is a popular machine learning algorithm. Also, it's important to note that the 'market_data.csv' file is illustrative. In practice, your dataset may contain different columns and you might need to adjust the code accordingly. Above model will allow you to be able to predict market trend based on the data from earlier in the day. 

For more accurate forecasting consider using more complex models and algorithms such as ARIMA, GARCH, LSTM or you can use Facebook's Prophet package which is quite good at forecasting time series data.
