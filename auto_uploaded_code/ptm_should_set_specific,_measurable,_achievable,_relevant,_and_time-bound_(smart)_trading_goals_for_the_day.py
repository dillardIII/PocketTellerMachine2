Sure, here's a simple example of how you might set SMART trading goals using Python. This code will not perform any real trading operations, but it's a good starting point for setting up your trading goals.

```python
class TradingGoal:
    def __init__(self, specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time_bound):
        self.specific = specific
        self.measurable = measurable
        self.achievable = achievable
        self.relevant = relevant
        self.time_bound = time_bound

    def display_goal(self):
        print(f"Specific: {self.specific}")
        print(f"Measurable: {self.measurable}")
        print(f"Achievable: {self.achievable}")
        print(f"Relevant: {self.relevant}")
        print(f"Time-bound: {self.time_bound}")

# Example of setting a trading goal
goal = TradingGoal(
    specific="Increase portfolio value",
    measurable="By 5%",
    achievable="By investing in high-growth tech stocks",
    relevant="To increase overall wealth",
    time_bound="By the end of Q1 2022"
)

goal.display_goal()
```

In this example, we create a `TradingGoal` class that takes in the five components of a SMART goal as parameters. We then create an instance of this class with a specific goal and display it.

Remember, this is just a simple example and doesn't include any real trading operations. In a real-world application, you would likely need to integrate with a trading API and add more complex logic to track and achieve your goals.
