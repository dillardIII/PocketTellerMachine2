Sure, I can help you with that. But first, I need to know what PTM stands for in this context and what kind of trading we are doing. Are we trading stocks, forex, cryptocurrency, or something else? Also, what kind of trading strategy are we using? Are we doing day trading, swing trading, or long-term investing? 

Assuming PTM stands for a trading bot and we are trading stocks using a simple moving average crossover strategy, here's a simple Python code:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Define the stock symbol
symbol = 'AAPL'

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download(symbol, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate the short-term simple moving average
short_sma = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-term simple moving average
long_sma = data['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create a column in the dataframe to hold the buy signals
data['Buy_Signal'] = (short_sma > long_sma)

# Create a column in the dataframe to hold the sell signals
data['Sell_Signal'] = (short_sma < long_sma)

# If there's a buy signal
if data['Buy_Signal'].iloc[-1] and not data['Sell_Signal'].iloc[-2]:
    print(f"PTM should initiate a BUY trade on {symbol}")

# If there's a sell signal
elif data['Sell_Signal'].iloc[-1] and not data['Buy_Signal'].iloc[-2]:
    print(f"PTM should initiate a SELL trade on {symbol}")

# If there's no signal
else:
    print(f"No trade signal for {symbol} at the moment.")
```

This code will download historical data for a given stock symbol, calculate the short-term and long-term simple moving averages, and then generate buy and sell signals based on these moving averages. If the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, it's a buy signal. If the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, it's a sell signal. The code will then print out whether PTM should initiate a buy trade, a sell trade, or no trade at all.

Please replace 'AAPL' with the stock symbol you want to trade and adjust the start and end dates as needed. Also, you may want to adjust the window parameters for the short-term and long-term moving averages depending on your trading strategy. 

Please note, this is a very simplified trading strategy and doesn't take into account many factors that could influence the success of a trade. Always do your own research and consider seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor before making any trading decisions.
