To conduct market research, you need to have access to real-time financial data. There are several APIs available that provide this data, such as Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, etc. Below is a simple example of how you can use the Alpha Vantage API to get stock data and identify potential profitable trading opportunities. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms can be very complex and use a lot more data and sophisticated statistical methods.

```python
import pandas as pd
from alpha_vantage.timeseries import TimeSeries

# Your Alpha Vantage API key
api_key = 'YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY'

# Initialize the TimeSeries class with your API key
ts = TimeSeries(key=api_key, output_format='pandas')

# Get daily adjusted stock data for Microsoft
data, meta_data = ts.get_daily_adjusted(symbol='MSFT', outputsize='full')

# Calculate the daily returns
data['daily_return'] = data['4. close'].pct_change()

# Identify potential trading opportunities where the daily return is greater than 2%
trading_opportunities = data[data['daily_return'] > 0.02]

print(trading_opportunities)
```

This code will print all the days where the daily return of Microsoft's stock was greater than 2%. You could consider these days as potential profitable trading opportunities.

Please replace 'YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY' with your actual API key. If you don't have one, you can get it for free on the Alpha Vantage website.

Remember, this is a very simple example and real trading involves a lot more factors and risks. Always do your own research and consider seeking advice from financial advisors.
