To analyze market trends and opportunities, we would need to have access to some kind of market data. This could be stock prices, trading volumes, or any other kind of financial data. Here is a simple example of how you might analyze stock prices using Python.

We will use the pandas library to handle our data, and the yfinance library to download stock price data from Yahoo Finance.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical market data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2020-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(50).mean()
data['MA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(200).mean()

# Identify potential wins (when the 50-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average)
data['Buy_Signal'] = data['MA_50'] > data['MA_200']

print(data)
```

This script downloads the historical price data for Apple's stock for the year 2020. It then calculates the 50-day and 200-day moving averages of the closing prices. A common strategy in stock trading is to buy when the 50-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average, which is what we identify as a "Buy_Signal" in this script.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world trading strategies are much more complex and take many more factors into account.

Also, it's important to note that you need to install the libraries used in this script. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas yfinance
```
