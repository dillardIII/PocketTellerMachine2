To optimize PTM's trading algorithms, we need to use machine learning techniques. Here is a basic example of how you can use Python and its libraries to create a simple trading algorithm. In this example, we will use a simple moving average crossover strategy.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, LSTM

# Assume we have a dataframe 'df' with 'Date' and 'Close' columns
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Calculate short-term simple moving average
Short_SMA = df.Close.rolling(window=5).mean()

# Calculate long-term simple moving average
Long_SMA = df.Close.rolling(window=20).mean()

# Create signals based on crossover
df['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(Short_SMA > Long_SMA, 1, 0)
df['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(Short_SMA < Long_SMA, -1, 0)

# Assume we start with no stock
df['Stock_On_Hand'] = 0

for i in range(len(df)):
    if df['Buy_Signal'][i] == 1:
        df['Stock_On_Hand'][i] = 1
    elif df['Sell_Signal'][i] == -1:
        df['Stock_On_Hand'][i] = 0
    else:
        df['Stock_On_Hand'][i] = df['Stock_On_Hand'][i-1]

# Calculate strategy performance
df['Daily_Return'] = df['Close'].pct_change() * df['Stock_On_Hand'].shift()
df['Strategy_Return'] = df['Daily_Return'].cumsum()

print(df)
```

This is a simple trading algorithm that buys when the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average and sells when the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average. The performance of the strategy is then calculated.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors. Also, this code does not take into account transaction costs or slippage.
