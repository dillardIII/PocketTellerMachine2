To develop and implement trading strategies, we can use Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation and analysis, numpy for mathematical operations, matplotlib for data visualization, and sklearn for machine learning.

Here is a simple Python code that implements a basic moving average crossover strategy. This strategy generates a buy signal when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average and a sell signal when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('trading_data.csv')

# Calculate the short-term moving average
data['Short_SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=5).mean()

# Calculate the long-term moving average
data['Long_SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Create a 'Signal' column where if Short_SMA is greater than Long_SMA then 1 else 0
data['Signal'] = np.where(data['Short_SMA'] > data['Long_SMA'], 1, 0)

# Shift the signal column to get the actual trading order for the next day
data['Order'] = data['Signal'].shift()

# Drop the NaN values
data = data.dropna()

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data[['Short_SMA', 'Long_SMA']], data['Order'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the classifier
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy*100:.2f}%')
```

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and might not give the best results. Also, the trading_data.csv file should contain the historical trading data with 'Close' prices. You may need to adjust the window size for short-term and long-term moving averages based on the specific requirements. 

For more advanced strategies, you might need to incorporate other technical indicators, machine learning algorithms, and possibly deep learning models.
