To initiate trades and gather data on wins and losses, we would need to interact with a trading API. Here is a simple example of how you might do this using the Alpaca API, a popular choice for algorithmic trading. 

Please note that this is a simplified example and a real trading bot would need to be much more complex to be effective. Also, remember that trading involves risk and should only be done with a thorough understanding of the process.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi
import time

# Set up the API
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Define a list to store the results of trades
trade_results = []

# Define a list of stocks to trade
stocks_to_trade = ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOG", "AMZN"]

# Loop through the stocks and initiate a trade for each one
for stock in stocks_to_trade:
    # Submit a market order to buy 1 share
    order = api.submit_order(
        symbol=stock,
        qty=1,
        side='buy',
        type='market',
        time_in_force='gtc'
    )

    # Wait for the order to fill
    time.sleep(15)

    # Check the status of the order
    filled_order = api.get_order(order.id)
    if filled_order.status == 'filled':
        # If the order was filled, store the result
        trade_results.append({
            'stock': stock,
            'price_bought': filled_order.filled_avg_price,
            'status': 'open'
        })

# At this point, you would typically wait for some time and then sell the stocks, recording the result
# For simplicity, we will assume that all trades are wins
for trade in trade_results:
    trade['status'] = 'win'

# Print the results
for trade in trade_results:
    print(f"Stock: {trade['stock']}, Price Bought: {trade['price_bought']}, Result: {trade['status']}")
```

This script will initiate trades for the stocks listed in `stocks_to_trade` and record the result of each trade. The result is always 'win' in this example, but in a real scenario, you would need to implement logic to determine whether each trade was a win or a loss.
