Creating an advanced Python module that implements intelligent recursion, especially for a fictional "PTM empire," requires some imagination and creativity. Let's say "PTM" refers to a specific aspect of your program's domain. We'll craft a Python module that demonstrates general intelligent recursion with elements such as memoization to optimize performanceâ€”an approach commonly used in dynamic programming and algorithm optimization.

Below is a conceptual Python module named `ptm_intelligent_recursion`. This module includes a recursive function with memoization as a decorator to enhance performance.

```python
# ptm_intelligent_recursion.py

from functools import wraps

def memoize(func):
    """Memoization decorator to cache results of recursive calls."""
    cache = {}

    @wraps(func)
    def memoized_func(*args):
        if args in cache:
            return cache[args]
        result = func(*args)
        cache[args] = result
        return result

    memoized_func.cache = cache
    return memoized_func

class PTMIntelligentRecursion:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    @memoize
    def intelligent_recursive_calculation(self, n):
        """
        An example of an intelligent recursive function to perform calculations.
        
        This implementation showcases a Fibonacci sequence with memoization.
        """
        # The intelligent heuristic or condition to stop recursion
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Negative values are not supported.")
        elif n <= 1:
            return n

        return (self.intelligent_recursive_calculation(n - 1) + 
                self.intelligent_recursive_calculation(n - 2))

    def start(self):
        # Example function to demonstrate intelligent recursion
        try:
            for i in range(len(self.data)):
                result = self.intelligent_recursive_calculation(self.data[i])
                print(f"Result for {self.data[i]}: {result}")
        except ValueError as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example data array of Fibonacci sequence positions
    example_data = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

    ptm = PTMIntelligentRecursion(example_data)
    ptm.start()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Memoization**: The `memoize` decorator caches the results of previous function calls to prevent repeated calculations, optimizing performance for recursive functions.

2. **PTMIntelligentRecursion Class**: Demonstrates the use of a class that processes an array, using the intelligent recursive function with memoization to print results.

3. **Intelligent Heuristics**: A placeholder for intelligent decision-making or optimizations, like raising an exception for invalid recursive conditions (`n < 0`).

4. **Example Usage**: The `start` method in the class is used to demonstrate recursion for calculating Fibonacci numbers, which is just one domain where recursion might be used effectively.

Feel free to expand upon this structure to suit more complex and domain-specific scenarios of the PTM empire, like handling data trees and complex graph structures! Modify the recursive function to recognize patterns or optimize more deeply based on your application's needs.
