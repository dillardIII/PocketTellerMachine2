Sure! Let's create a simple Python utility called `EmpireOptimizer` that helps manage resources and optimize the allocation of resources in a fictional empire simulation. The goal is to ensure efficient distribution of resources (like food, gold, and wood) across different sectors (such as military, agriculture, and construction) given certain constraints and priorities.

```python
class EmpireOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, resources, sectors, priorities):
        """
        Initialize the EmpireOptimizer with available resources, sectors, and sector priorities.

        :param resources: Dictionary of available resources.
        :param sectors: List of sectors requiring resources.
        :param priorities: Dictionary of priorities for each sector.
        """
        self.resources = resources
        self.sectors = sectors
        self.priorities = priorities
        self.allocations = {sector: {resource: 0 for resource in resources} for sector in sectors}

    def optimize_resources(self):
        """
        Optimize the allocation of resources based on sector priorities.
        """
        total_priority = sum(self.priorities.values())
        # Allocate resources based on priority
        for sector in self.sectors:
            sector_priority = self.priorities[sector] / total_priority
            for resource in self.resources:
                allocated = int(self.resources[resource] * sector_priority)
                self.allocations[sector][resource] = allocated

    def report(self):
        """
        Report the current allocation of resources.
        """
        print("Resource Allocation Report:\n")
        for sector, resources in self.allocations.items():
            print(f"Sector: {sector}")
            for resource, amount in resources.items():
                print(f"  {resource}: {amount}")
            print("")

    def adjust_priority(self, sector, new_priority):
        """
        Adjust the priority for a given sector and re-optimize resources.
        
        :param sector: The sector to adjust priority for.
        :param new_priority: The new priority value.
        """
        if sector in self.priorities:
            self.priorities[sector] = new_priority
            self.optimize_resources()
        else:
            print(f"Sector '{sector}' not found.")

# Example Usage
resources = {'food': 1000, 'gold': 500, 'wood': 800}
sectors = ['military', 'agriculture', 'construction']
priorities = {'military': 3, 'agriculture': 5, 'construction': 2}

empire_optimizer = EmpireOptimizer(resources, sectors, priorities)
empire_optimizer.optimize_resources()
empire_optimizer.report()

# Adjust priority for agriculture and reoptimize
empire_optimizer.adjust_priority('agriculture', 7)
empire_optimizer.report()
```

### Explanation:
- **Resources**: A dictionary representing available resources in the empire.
- **Sectors**: Different areas like military, agriculture, and construction that require resource allocation.
- **Priorities**: Determines how critical each sector is. Higher values indicate greater importance.
- **optimize_resources**: Allocates resources proportionally based on sector priority.
- **report**: Prints the allocation of resources for each sector.
- **adjust_priority**: Allows modification of a sector's priority and automatically updates allocations.

This utility is quite simplified but can serve as a basis for more intricate resource management systems in simulation games. You can expand it by adding additional constraints and dynamics like resource production and consumption rates.
