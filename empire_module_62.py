Creating an advanced Python module to simulate a powerful and complex system, such as an "unstoppable PTM (Predictive Text Model) empire," involves using concepts like recursion, machine learning, and possibly other advanced programming techniques. Below is a conceptual module outline incorporating intelligent recursion, which could be a recursive approach that adapts based on the context or data it processes.

Note: This code is a conceptual framework. Implementing a real predictive text model involves extensive machine learning techniques typically using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The recursion part here is more about structuring logic in a hierarchical manner.

```python
# ptm_empire.py
import random

class PTMEmpire:
    def __init__(self, vocabulary=None):
        # Initialize with a default vocabulary if not provided:
        self.vocabulary = vocabulary or ["quantum", "empire", "singularity", "data", "recursive", "intelligence"]
    
    def generate_text(self, seed=None, depth=3, max_words=50):
        """
        Uses intelligent recursion to generate text based on seed and vocabulary.
        
        :param seed: Initial word or concept to seed the generation.
        :param depth: The recursion depth to determine complexity or hierarchy.
        :param max_words: Maximum number of words in the generated text.
        :return: Generated text as a string.
        """
        if seed:
            # Start with seed if provided:
            current_word = seed
        else:
            # Otherwise, pick a random seed from the vocabulary
            current_word = random.choice(self.vocabulary)
        
        # Start the recursive generation
        return self._recursive_generate(current_word, depth, max_words)

        :return: Generated text based on recursion.
        """
        if current_text is None:
            current_text = current_word
        else:
            current_text += " " + current_word

        if len(current_text.split()) >= max_words or depth <= 0:
            return current_text

        # Intelligent choice of the next word based on depth (mimicking complexity)
        next_word = self._choose_next_word(current_word, depth)
        
        # Recur with reduced depth
        return self._recursive_generate(next_word, depth - 1, max_words, current_text)
    
    def _choose_next_word(self, current_word, depth):
        """

        :param current_word: The current word being processed.
        :param depth: The current recursive depth.
        :return: The chosen next word to append.
        """
        # Simulated intelligence: weight choice based on a 'depth' factor
        options = [word for word in self.vocabulary if word != current_word]:

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize the PTM Empire
    ptm = PTMEmpire()
    
    # Generate text with default settings
    generated_text = ptm.generate_text(seed="quantum")
    print("Generated Text:\n", generated_text)
```

### Explanation:
- **PTMEmpire Class**: The main class representing our text generation system.
- **generate_text**: This is the entry point for generating text. It initializes the process and controls parameters like depth and max words.
- **_recursive_generate**: The core recursive function that builds the text. It appends words and manages stopping conditions.
- **_choose_next_word**: Selects the next word based on the current context, using a mock 'intelligent' method with depth-based probabilistic selection.

### Further Development:
- To turn this into a sophisticated model, integrate a trained machine learning model to choose the next word instead of random choices.
- Develop a richer vocabulary and more complex logic for word selection, considering semantic coherence and syntactical structure.
- Add features for advanced context management and world-dynamics simulation within the 'PTM empire'.
