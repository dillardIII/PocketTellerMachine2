Creating an advanced Python module that features intelligent recursion involves incorporating techniques such as memoization to optimize recursive calls, leveraging Python's capabilities for efficient problem-solving, and possibly using decorators to enhance functionality. Below is an example of a Python module named `intelligent_recursion` for the fictional PTM empire, which demonstrates intelligent recursion through the calculation of Fibonacci numbers:

```python
# intelligent_recursion.py

class Memoize:
    """A memoization class to cache function results."""
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
        self.cache = {}

    def __call__(self, *args):
        if args not in self.cache:
            print(f"Computing new result for {args}")
            self.cache[args] = self.func(*args)
        else:
            print(f"Using cached result for {args}")
        return self.cache[args]

def intelligent_recursion():
    @Memoize
    def fibonacci(n):
        """Compute nth Fibonacci number using intelligent recursion with memoization logic."""
        if n < 2:
            return n
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

    def wrapper_fibonacci(n):
        """Wrapper for the Fibonacci calculation that includes input validation."""
        if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer.")
        return fibonacci(n)

    return wrapper_fibonacci

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Instantiate the intelligent recursion feature for Fibonacci.
    fib_calculator = intelligent_recursion()

    try:
        # Example of Fibonacci with intelligent recursion
        print(fib_calculator(10))  # Output: 55
        print(fib_calculator(15))  # Output: 610
        print(fib_calculator(10))  # Output is cached
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
```

### Key Features of this Module:

1. **Memoization Class**: By creating a `Memoize` class, we wrap the function needing optimization to store previously computed results, dramatically reducing computation time for overlap calls within recursive functions.

2. **Flexible Design**: Adopting a class-based memoization adds the flexibility of caching any function that fits the recursive pattern.

3. **Input Validation**: Ensures that only valid inputs are processed, throwing an exception with clear messaging when a negative or non-integer is provided.

4. **Decorator Usage**: The `Memoize` class acts as a decorator to seamlessly integrate caching into the recursive logic without altering the fundamental nature of the function.

5. **Interactive Debugging**: The module provides prints that help trace whether a result is being computed anew or pulled from the cache, useful for educational purposes or debugging.

6. **Scalability**: The example here is based on Fibonacci numbers, but the same architecture can be applied to other recursive problems like calculating factorials, traversing trees or graphs, solving the Tower of Hanoi problem, and more.

This module forms the foundation of an efficient and scalable recursive system, capable of solving complex recursive problems within the PTM empire by leveraging intelligent recursion techniques in Python.
