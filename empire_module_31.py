Creating an advanced Python module that employs intelligent recursion involves writing a module with self-optimizing algorithms that adapt based on input to make recursive calls more efficient. For the sake of this example, I will create a Python module that focuses on solving the problem of finding the nth Fibonacci number using a recursive approach with memoization as a form of optimizing recursion.

Here's what the module might look like:

```python
# module: intelligent_recursion.py

class IntelligentRecursion:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memo = {}

    def fibonacci(self, n):
        """
        Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using intelligent recursion with memoization.

        Parameters:
        n (int): The position in the Fibonacci sequence to calculate.

        Returns:
        int: The nth Fibonacci number.
        """
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Negative arguments are not supported")
        if n in [0, 1]:
            return n
        if n not in self.memo:
            print(f"Calculating Fibonacci({n})")
            self.memo[n] = self.fibonacci(n - 1) + self.fibonacci(n - 2)
        return self.memo[n]

    def clear_memo(self):
        """
        Clear the memoization cache, if needed.:
        """
        self.memo = {}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ir = IntelligentRecursion()
    position = 10
    result = ir.fibonacci(position)
    print(f"The {position}th Fibonacci number is {result}")
```

### Key Features of the Module:

1. **Memoization**: This technique is used to store previously calculated results, reducing the number of redundant calculations for higher Fibonacci numbers.

2. **Exception Handling**: The function raises an error for negative Fibonacci indices, which are not valid.

3. **Intuitive API**: The class-based design makes it easy to use and clear, and it could be extended for other recursive problems.

4. **Clear Memoization**: A method `clear_memo()` is added to reset the saved states, which can be useful if you need to compute new series or perform multiple distinct recursive calculations.:

### Explanation:

- **Recursive Calculation**: The `fibonacci` method leverages the natural recursive definition of the Fibonacci sequence but optimizes using memoization to store results of previously calculated Fibonacci numbers.

- **Efficiency**: While a naive recursive implementation of Fibonacci is inefficient with exponential time complexity, incorporating memoization results in a linear time complexity, O(n), as each number in the sequence is computed once.

This module would be easy to extend to other problems and scenarios where recursion is appropriate but potentially inefficient without optimization strategies like memoization.
