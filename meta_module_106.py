Designing a new Python module for the PTM (Presumably a fictional entity) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack involves incorporating advanced concepts from the fields of AI, machine learning, and potentially even bio-inspired computing to enable recursive and scalable growth. To achieve this, we'll draft a conceptual framework for the module while employing innovative and recursive strategies.

### Module Overview: `ptm_auto_stack`

This module, `ptm_auto_stack`, aims to enhance the PTM empire’s autonomy stack by embedding self-evolving recursive strategies. The primary components will include automatic model evolution, environmental feedback integration, modular plugin architecture, and robust error handling.

#### Key Components:

1. **Self-Evolving Models:** 
   - Implement genetic algorithms or neuroevolution to allow models to evolve by themselves.
   - Models will iteratively improve by selecting the best-performing algorithms based on defined fitness criteria.

2. **Recursive Learning Strategies:**
   - Develop recursive neural networks (RNNs) or transformers to process and adapt based on temporal data.
   - Recursive unsupervised learning techniques to refine perception and action policies.

3. **Environmental Feedback Loop:**
   - Integrate environment simulators which provide feedback for continuous learning.
   - Real-time data pipelines that adjust model parameters based on changing inputs.

4. **Modular Architecture:**
   - Use a plugin-based system to allow easy integration of new algorithms and sensors.
   - Provide APIs for external modules to communicate and synchronize effectively.

5. **Error Handling and Recovery:**
   - Implement systems for detecting anomalies and applying self-correction protocols.
   - Backup and recovery mechanisms to maintain system integrity.

### Conceptual Code Framework

Below is a conceptual framework showcasing how such a module might be structured. Note that this serves as a high-level draft:

```python
# ptm_auto_stack.py

import numpy as np
from evolving_strategies import GeneticAlgorithm, NeuroEvolution
from feedback_integration import FeedbackLoop
from plugin_system import PluginManager
from error_handling import AnomalyDetector, RecoverySystem

class PTMAutoStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = []
        self.plugin_manager = PluginManager()
        self.feedback_loop = FeedbackLoop()
        self.anomaly_detector = AnomalyDetector()
        self.recovery_system = RecoverySystem()
    
    def evolve_models(self):
        """
        Apply self-evolution strategies to improve models iteratively.
        """
        ga = GeneticAlgorithm()
        ne = NeuroEvolution()
        self.models = ga.evolve(self.models)
        self.models = ne.evolve(self.models)
    
    def recursive_strategies(self, data):
        """
        Process data using recursive strategies for adaptation.
        """
        # Implement RNNs, hierarchical learning, etc.
        self.feedback_loop.update(data)
    
    def integrate_plugins(self):
        """
        Load and integrate modular plugins.
        """
        self.plugin_manager.load_plugins([
            'sensor_plugin', 'control_plugin'
        ])
    
    def handle_errors(self, data):
        """
        Detect and recover from system anomalies.
        """
        if self.anomaly_detector.detect(data):
            self.recovery_system.recover()
    
    def run(self, data_stream):
        """
        Main execution loop to enhance autonomy stack capabilities.
        """
        for data in data_stream:
            self.recursive_strategies(data)
            self.evolve_models()
            self.handle_errors(data)
            self.integrate_plugins()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    data_stream = np.random.random((1000, 10))  # Hypothetical data stream
    auto_stack = PTMAutoStack()
    auto_stack.run(data_stream)
```

### Detailed Explanation

- **GeneticAlgorithm & NeuroEvolution:** These components are responsible for the self-evolving capability of the model. They iteratively enhance the models based on some fitness measure.
  
- **FeedbackLoop:** It delivers real-time environmental feedback which informs the model adjustments.
  
- **PluginManager:** This fosters a flexible module architecture, allowing integration of various functionalities without altering the core system.

- **AnomalyDetector & RecoverySystem:** Critical for ensuring robustness and reliability, they manage system errors and offer self-healing capabilities.

This design serves as a starting point for developing a highly scalable and adaptable self-evolving module. Each component can be further elaborated and optimized based on specific use cases and technological advancements.
