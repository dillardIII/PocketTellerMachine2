Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a made-up entity) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves a creative approach to autonomous systems and machine learning. Here’s an outline for a conceptual Python module named `ptm_autonomy` with a focus on recursive strategies:

```python
# ptm_autonomy.py

import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

class SelfEvolvingAutonomy:
    def __init__(self, initial_state, learning_rate=0.01):
        self.state = initial_state
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.history = [initial_state]  # To track state changes
        self.environment = self._create_environment()
        self.models = {}

    def _create_environment(self):
        """Initialize a complex environment represented as a graph."""
        G = nx.Graph()
        # Add nodes and edges representing entities and interactions
        # For simplicity, use a simple grid
        for i in range(5):
            for j in range(5):
                G.add_node((i, j))
                if i > 0:
                    G.add_edge((i, j), (i-1, j))
                if j > 0:
                    G.add_edge((i, j), (i, j-1))
        return G

    def recursive_strategy(self, state, depth=1):
        """Implement a recursive strategy to adapt to complex environments."""
        if depth == 0:
            return self.simple_step(state)
        # Example recursive learning process
        new_state = self.simple_step(state)
        return self.recursive_strategy(new_state, depth - 1)

    def simple_step(self, state):
        """A simple state transition using a model, dummy implementation."""
        # Dummy update: adding learning_rate as an example
        new_state = state + self.learning_rate
        self.history.append(new_state)
        return new_state

    def evolve(self, steps=10, strategy_depth=1):
        """Evolve the system over a number of steps using recursive strategies."""
        for _ in range(steps):
            self.state = self.recursive_strategy(self.state, depth=strategy_depth)

    def evaluate_performance(self):
        """Evaluate system performance based on state history."""
        # Placeholder performance evaluation
        return np.mean(self.history)

    def create_recursive_model(self, name):
        """Create a recursive model and store it for later use."""
        self.models[name] = self.recursive_strategy

    def load_model(self, name):
        """Load a recursive model if it exists.""":
        if name in self.models:
            return self.models[name]
        else:
            raise ValueError("Model not found.")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize with an initial state
    initial_state = 0.0
    autonomy_system = SelfEvolvingAutonomy(initial_state)
    
    # Evolve the system using recursive strategies
    autonomy_system.evolve(steps=20, strategy_depth=3)
    
    # Evaluate and print(out the performance)
    performance = autonomy_system.evaluate_performance()
    print(f"Performance after evolution: {performance}")
```

### Module Features:
1. **Environment Representation**: Utilizes graph structures to represent complex environments, making it conducive for various AI algorithms.

2. **Recursive Strategy Implementation**: Uses recursive calls to adapt the state. Each recursion level represents a deeper level of strategy, adding complexity and potential learning depth.

3. **Dummy Learning Implementation**: Implements basic state transitions to demonstrate the idea of evolving states using a simple learning approach.

4. **Model Storage and Retrieval**: Allows creating and storing recursive models that can be reloaded and reused.

5. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates the system’s performance based upon changes in state over time.

This is a simplified framework and can be expanded with real machine learning algorithms, more sophisticated environment interactions, and advanced data structures to truly realize self-evolving recursive strategies in autonomy. In practice, a system like this would likely involve advanced reinforcement learning or adaptive algorithms to effectively handle real-world complexities.
