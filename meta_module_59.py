Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably short for a fictional or specific organization such as "Prime Technology Management" or similar) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that continuously adapts and optimizes itself. This can be inspired by concepts like reinforcement learning, genetic algorithms, and neural architecture search. Below is a high-level design of such a module, complete with a brief explanation of the key components. Note that the module includes innovative recursive strategies to enable self-improvement.

### Overview

The module, called `EvolutionEngine`, is structured into components that facilitate learning, adaptation, and optimization of autonomous behaviors. It leverages a recursive strategy by continuously evaluating and modifying its own components through a loop of analysis and synthesis.

### Components

1. **Core Components**

    - **Environment Interface**: This component interacts with environments, abstracting complexities and providing a standard API for observations and actions.
    
    - **Agent**: The primary decision-maker which uses learned policies to make decisions.
    
    - **Policy Network**: A neural network representing the agentâ€™s policy, which guides decision-making.
    
    - **Memory Buffer**: Stores experiences (state, action, reward, next state) used for training.
    
    - **Optimizer**: Implements strategies like gradient descent to update the policy network.

2. **Evolutionary Strategies**

    - **Self-Evolution Engine**: This module employs genetic algorithms to spawn new iterations of the policy network. It evaluates the fitness of offspring models by simulating them in various environments.

    - **Recursive Policy Refinement (RPR)**: Iteratively enhances policies by recursively decomposing complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks and evolving them separately.

    - **Adaptive Crossover and Mutation**: Applies genetic mutations and crossovers to network architectures to explore diverse solutions.

3. **Recursive Self-Improvement**

    - **Feedback Loop Manager**: Continuously monitors performance metrics and feedback loops to identify areas for improvement.

    - **Recursive Learning**: Implements a recursive approach to learning that breaks down tasks into sub-tasks, learns each efficiently, and then combines learned sub-policies.

4. **Meta-Learning**

    - **Topology Adjuster**: Dynamically adjusts network topologies using a search algorithm to improve learning efficiency.

    - **Reinforcement Meta-Learner**: Adjusts hyperparameters like learning rates, discovery techniques, and optimization strategies based on recursive performance evaluations.

5. **Data Management**

    - **Experience Replay**: Stores and samples from a memory of previous experiences to break correlation in data.
    
    - **Dynamic Task Generator**: Generates new tasks or variations of existing tasks to ensure robustness and adaptability.

### Example Implementation

```python
class EvolutionEngine:
    def __init__(self, environment):
        self.env = EnvironmentInterface(environment)
        self.agent = Agent()
        self.self_evolution = SelfEvolutionEngine()
        self.memory = MemoryBuffer()
        self.feedback_loop = FeedbackLoopManager()

    def train(self, episodes):
        for episode in range(episodes):
            state = self.env.reset()
            done = False
            while not done:
                action = self.agent.act(state)
                next_state, reward, done, info = self.env.step(action)
                self.memory.store(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
                
                # Train the agent using stored experiences
                self.agent.learn(self.memory.sample())
                
                state = next_state
                
            # Perform self-evolution processes
            self.self_evolution.evolve(self.agent.policy)

        # Recursive policy refinement
        self.agent.policy = RecursivePolicyRefinement.refine(self.agent.policy)

# Additional code would define the components such as Agent, SelfEvolutionEngine, recursive
# refinement strategies, and the interface to various environments.
```

### Key Innovations

1. **Recursive Policy Refinement**: By recursively decomposing tasks and policies, this module uniquely optimizes sub-policies and integrates them back into the primary policy flow, resembling a divide-and-conquer approach.

2. **Evolving Architectures**: Using evolutionary strategies to modify neural network architectures adds an adaptive dimension to exploration, enabling the system to find novel architectures suited to dynamic tasks.

3. **Meta-Learning with Recursive Feedback**: The recursive feedback loops not only adjust policies but also hyperparameters and network architectures, leading to a highly adaptive self-tuning system.

This framework provides a robust foundation for developing adaptive, self-improving autonomous systems capable of tackling complex, dynamic environments. The recursive strategies ensure continual enhancement, making it suitable for an expanding autonomy stack within the PTM empire.
