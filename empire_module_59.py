Creating an advanced Python module with intelligent recursion for a hypothetical "PTM empire" could involve several components. Here, we'll conceptualize such a module that handles complex recursive problems with intelligent decision-making capabilities. We'll focus on a flexible recursive system that can optimize itself over time, with hypothetical use cases such as decision trees, optimization problems, or complex data analysis.

Let's define some features for this module:

1. **Dynamic Problem Solving**: The module can detect the nature of the problem and adjust its recursion strategy.
2. **Memoization and Caching**: To avoid redundant calculations, the module includes caching mechanisms.
3. **Adaptive Depth Control**: The recursion depth is dynamically controlled based on the problem complexity.
4. **Parallel Execution**: Supports multi-threading or multi-processing for handling larger datasets or complex recursions.
5. **Learning from Past Executions**: Ability to optimize based on past problem-solving sessions.

Here's a basic structure for such a module, with a focus on adaptable recursion:

```python
# ptm_empire.py

import functools
import multiprocessing
import threading
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, ProcessPoolExecutor

class IntelligentRecursion:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
        self.use_multiprocessing = False
        self.max_depth = 1000
        self.adaptive_control = True

    def recursive_solver(self, problem, *args, depth=0, max_depth=1000):
        # Abort condition w/ adaptive depth control
        if depth > max_depth and self.adaptive_control:
            raise RecursionError("Maximum recursion depth reached")

        # Use caching to avoid redundant computing
        if (problem, args) in self.cache:
            return self.cache[(problem, args)]

        # Base cases for termination
        if self.is_base_case(problem, *args):
            result = self.solve_base_case(problem, *args)
        else:
            result = self.intelligent_divide_and_conquer(problem, *args, depth=depth+1)

        # Cache the result before returning
        self.cache[(problem, args)] = result
        return result

    def intelligent_divide_and_conquer(self, problem, *args, depth):
        subtasks = self.divide_problem(problem, *args)
        results = []

        # Choose execution method based on problem size and complexity
        if len(subtasks) > 10 and self.use_multiprocessing:
            with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
                results = list(executor.map(lambda task: self.recursive_solver(*task, depth=depth), subtasks))
        else:
            with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
                results = list(executor.map(lambda task: self.recursive_solver(*task, depth=depth), subtasks))

        return self.combine_results(results)

    def is_base_case(self, problem, *args):
        # Placeholder for base case determination logic
        return False

    def solve_base_case(self, problem, *args):
        # Placeholder for base case solution logic
        pass

    def divide_problem(self, problem, *args):
        # Placeholder for problem division logic
        return [((problem, *args),)]

    def combine_results(self, results):
        # Placeholder for result combination logic
        return None

    def set_multiprocessing(self, use_multiprocessing):
        self.use_multiprocessing = use_multiprocessing

    def set_max_depth(self, max_depth):
        self.max_depth = max_depth

    def enable_adaptive_control(self, adaptive_control):
        self.adaptive_control = adaptive_control

# Example usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    solver = IntelligentRecursion()
    solver.set_multiprocessing(True)
    
    # Assuming we have a problem defined
    problem = "ExampleProblem"  # This would be a real problem object or identifier
    solution = solver.recursive_solver(problem, initial_conditions="start")
    print("Solution:", solution)
```

### Key Features:

- **Caching**: Uses a dictionary `self.cache` to store previously computed results.
- **Adaptive Control**: Automatically adjusts maximum recursion depth and can switch between parallel and non-parallel execution based on problem properties.
- **Parallel Execution**: Supports switching between threading and multiprocessing for concurrent execution of sub-tasks using executors.
- **Intelligent Problem Division and Combination**: Methods to divide and combine problem parts, serving as placeholders for actual implementation logic.

This is a conceptual framework. To use it in real scenarios, you'd replace placeholders with the logic specific to your problems and requirements.
