Creating a Python module for an "unstoppable PTM (Presumed Task Manager) empire" with intelligent recursion involves designing a system that can handle tasks smartly, using recursive techniques to solve complex problems efficiently. Below is an example of such a module, showcasing a task manager that can handle tasks with dependencies recursively. The intelligent recursion part would ensure tasks are executed in the correct order based on their dependencies:

```python
# ptm_empire.py

from collections import defaultdict

class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # Dependency graph represented by an adjacency list
        self.task_graph = defaultdict(list)
        self.tasks = set()
    
    def add_task(self, task, dependencies=[]):
        """Add a new task with its dependencies."""
        if task in dependencies:
            raise ValueError("A task cannot depend on itself.")
        
        self.tasks.add(task)
        for dep in dependencies:
            self.tasks.add(dep)
            self.task_graph[task].append(dep)
    
    def perform_tasks(self):
        """Perform all tasks ensuring dependencies are resolved."""
        visited = {}
        task_order = []

        for task in self.tasks:
            if task not in visited:
                if not self._perform_task_recursively(task, visited, task_order):
                    raise Exception("Circular dependency detected.")
        
        return task_order
    
    def _perform_task_recursively(self, task, visited, task_order):
        """Helper method to perform a task with dependency checking."""
        if task in visited:
            return visited[task]

        visited[task] = False  # Mark task as being visited in this path
        for dep in self.task_graph[task]:
            if not self._perform_task_recursively(dep, visited, task_order):
                return False  # If dependency cannot be completed, fail
        
        visited[task] = True  # Mark task as completed
        task_order.append(task)
        return True

    def display_dependencies(self):
        """Display the task dependencies graph."""
        print("Task Dependencies Graph:")
        for task, dependencies in self.task_graph.items():
            print(f"{task}: {dependencies}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    tm = TaskManager()
    tm.add_task('Task1', ['Task2', 'Task3'])
    tm.add_task('Task2', ['Task4'])
    tm.add_task('Task3', [])
    tm.add_task('Task4', [])
    
    tm.display_dependencies()
    
    try:
        order = tm.perform_tasks()
        print("Tasks can be completed in the following order:")
        print(order)
    except Exception as e:
        print(str(e))
```

### Explanation:

1. **Task Manager Class**: Handles adding tasks with their dependencies, performing them with intelligent recursion, and displaying the current dependency graph.

2. **Dependency Graph**: A dictionary where each task points to a list of dependencies. This allows for easy traversal using recursion.

3. **Intelligent Recursion**: The `_perform_task_recursively` function handles tasks with dependencies using depth-first search (DFS), ensuring tasks are performed only when all dependencies are resolved. It uses a `visited` dictionary to keep track of the visit state (not visited, visited in the path, fully processed).

4. **Circular Dependency Detection**: If a task is revisited before it has been completely processed, it means there's a circular dependency, and the function gracefully handles it by raising an exception.

5. **Task Order**: The tasks are appended to `task_order` as they are completed, ensuring they are executed in a valid order.

This architecture provides the flexibility and power required in a recursive task management system to efficiently handle complex dependencies.
