Creating a new Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably a fictional or specified entity) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack is an exciting and complex task. Let's assume that this task involves designing a system that can autonomously learn, adapt, and optimize its processes using recursive strategies. This module could incorporate concepts from machine learning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous systems.

Hereâ€™s an outline along with a sample Python module to illustrate these concepts:

### Key Components
1. **Adaptive Learning Engine**:
   - Learns and evolves strategies using reinforcement learning.
   - Implements recursive self-improvement through simulated environments.

2. **Recursive Strategy Optimizer**:
   - Continuously optimizes decision-making paths.
   - Employs genetic algorithms or similar approaches to mutate and select optimal strategies.

3. **Autonomous System Controller**:
   - Manages and directs autonomous agents.
   - Integrates feedback loop for self-assessment and performance tuning.

### Sample Python Module

```python
import numpy as np
import random
from typing import Callable, List

class AdaptiveLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate: float, discount_factor: float):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.discount_factor = discount_factor
        self.value_table = {}

    def update_value(self, state, reward, next_state):
        old_value = self.value_table.get(state, 0)
        future_value = self.value_table.get(next_state, 0)
        new_value = old_value + self.learning_rate * (reward + self.discount_factor * future_value - old_value)
        self.value_table[state] = new_value

    def choose_action(self, state, possible_actions: List):
        # Implement an epsilon-greedy strategy
        epsilon = 0.1
        if random.uniform(0, 1) < epsilon:
            return random.choice(possible_actions)
        else:
            action_values = {action: self.value_table.get((state, action), 0) for action in possible_actions}
            return max(action_values, key=action_values.get)

class RecursiveStrategyOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, mutation_rate: float):
        self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate

    def optimize_strategy(self, population: List[Callable], fitness_function: Callable):
        # Evaluate current strategies' fitness
        fitness_scores = [(strategy, fitness_function(strategy)) for strategy in population]
        # Select the top-performing strategies
        top_strategies = sorted(fitness_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:int(len(population) / 2)]
        # Generate new strategies through crossover and mutation
        new_population = self._crossover_and_mutate([strategy for strategy, score in top_strategies])
        return new_population

    def _crossover_and_mutate(self, top_strategies):
        new_population = []
        while len(new_population) < len(top_strategies) * 2:
            new_strategy = self._crossover(random.choice(top_strategies), random.choice(top_strategies))
            new_strategy = self._mutate(new_strategy)
            new_population.append(new_strategy)
        return new_population

    def _crossover(self, strategy1, strategy2):
        # Simple crossover for demonstration purposes
        return lambda x: strategy1(x) if random.random() < 0.5 else strategy2(x):
:
    def _mutate(self, strategy):
        if random.random() < self.mutation_rate:
            return lambda x: strategy(x) + (random.random() - 0.5)  # Small mutation
        return strategy

class AutonomousSystemController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = []

    def register_agent(self, agent):
        self.agents.append(agent)

    def execute(self):
        for agent in self.agents:
            agent.run()

# Example use-cases and expansion strategies might involve dynamic environments,
# where these components interact and autonomously adapt to achieve common goals.

# This module provides a framework. For a real-world application, more detailed implementations 
# concerning state representation, action spaces, and fitness metrics must be considered.

```

### How It Works
- **AdaptiveLearningEngine**: Uses a rudimentary form of Q-learning for updating value estimates using rewards from dynamic interactions.
- **RecursiveStrategyOptimizer**: Implements a simple genetic algorithm to evolve strategies through crossover and mutation.
- **AutonomousSystemController**: Orchestrates multiple agents that adapt based on the feedback from the environment.

### Expanding on this Framework
1. **Integration with Data Streams**: Leverage real-time data inputs to adapt and evolve strategies more effectively.
2. **Scalable Architecture**: Design the module to operate in a distributed fashion, allowing it to handle more complex scenarios.
3. **State-of-the-Art Techniques**: Incorporate advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning or multi-agent systems frameworks.
4. **Feedback Loops**: Establish constant evaluation and improvement cycles using feedback loops at different granularity.
5. **Ethical and Safe AI Guidelines**: Ensure the autonomy stack respects ethical guidelines and safety norms, especially in decision-making and adaptation processes.

This framework serves as a starting point to explore recursive and autonomous system strategies, and it can then be tailored and scaled to fit the specific goals and requirements of the PTM empire.
