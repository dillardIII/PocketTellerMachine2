Creating an advanced Python module that showcases the power of recursion can be interesting and educational. Below is a concept for a module, "ptm_recursive_tools," which provides intelligent recursive algorithms for solving complex problems. These algorithms will be designed to optimize recursion, avoid stack overflow issues, and enhance efficiency with techniques like memoization and tail recursion.

### Description:

1. **Memoized Factorial:** Uses LRU (Least Recently Used) cache to store previously calculated factorials to optimize recursive function calls.

2. **Tail Recursive Fibonacci:** Optimized tail recursive function to compute Fibonacci numbers, reducing stack overhead.

3. **Binary Search Recursive:** Implements binary search using recursion to find an element's position in a sorted list.

4. **Intelligent GCD:** Uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor via recursion.

5. **Depth First Search with Cycle Handling:** This function performs DFS while managing cycles in graphs using a set to track visited nodes.

This module can be expanded with more intelligent recursive algorithms tailored to solving specific complex problems efficiently.
