Designing a Python module for the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves incorporating advanced concepts like self-improvement, recursive learning, and adaptability. The module needs to be flexible, scalable, and capable of autonomous decision-making. Here's a high-level design with some code snippets and explanations:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.utils import shuffle

class RecursiveLearner(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
    def __init__(self, base_model, improvement_threshold=0.01, max_iterations=10):
        """
        Initialize the Recursive Learner with a base model and parameters for improvement.
        
        Args:
            base_model: An instance of a scikit-learn estimator.
            improvement_threshold: A float that indicates the minimum improvement needed to continue recursion.
            max_iterations: An integer to limit the number of recursive improvements.
        """
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.improvement_threshold = improvement_threshold
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations
        self.history = []

    def fit(self, X, y):
        """
        Fit the model using recursive improvement strategy.

        Args:
            X: Input features.
            y: Target vector.
        """
        X, y = shuffle(X, y)
        best_score = 0
        iterations = 0

        while iterations < self.max_iterations:
            X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

            self.base_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
            predictions = self.base_model.predict(X_val)
            score = accuracy_score(y_val, predictions)
            self.history.append(score)

            improvement = score - best_score
            if improvement > self.improvement_threshold:
                best_score = score
            else:
                break

            iterations += 1

    def predict(self, X):
        """
        Make predictions using the fitted model.
        
        Args:
            X: Input features for prediction.
            
        Returns:
            Predicted values.
        """
        return self.base_model.predict(X)

    def evolve(self):
        """
        Implement a self-evolution mechanism for the learning algorithm.
        This could involve hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, or model architecture changes.
        """
        # Placeholder for an evolution strategy like genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning.
        pass

    def adapt(self, new_data):
        """
        Adapt to new data and adjust the model accordingly.
        
        Args:
            new_data: New data to fine-tune the model.
        """
        # Fine-tune with new data
        X_new, y_new = new_data
        self.fit(X_new, y_new)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

    data = load_iris()
    X, y = data.data, data.target

    # Initialize with a base model
    base_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10, random_state=42)
    learner = RecursiveLearner(base_model)

    learner.fit(X, y)

    # Simulate evolving and adapting
    learner.evolve()
    learner.adapt((X, y))

    print("Training history:", learner.history)
```

### Key Features and Concepts

1. **Recursive Improvement:** This concept is implemented with a loop that attempts to improve the model's performance iteratively. The loop stops when there's no significant improvement or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

2. **Evolution and Adaptation:** A placeholder method `evolve()` is designed to allow the model to explore new strategies autonomously, potentially by using genetic algorithms or other meta-learning techniques. The `adapt()` function allows the model to tune itself based on new data.

3. **Modular Design:** The module is designed to accept any scikit-learn estimator as the base model, allowing easy experimentation with different algorithms.

4. **Self-Monitoring:** The method keeps track of its performance history to facilitate analysis and further adaptation strategies.

Feel free to expand or customize this framework according to the specific needs and goals of the PTM empire's autonomy stack.
