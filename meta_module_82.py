Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional empire for the purposes of this task) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves several considerations around modularity, scalability, and adaptability. The module should support recursive strategies for autonomous decision-making and learning. Below is a conceptual design with accompanying code snippets to illustrate the main ideas.

### Objectives:
1. **Modularity**: Define a structure for interconnected components of the stack.
2. **Scalability**: Ensure components can be extended or augmented as needs evolve.
3. **Adaptability**: Components should be capable of self-adjustment and learning.
4. **Recursive Strategies**: Leverage recursion to enable complex decision-making and learning patterns.

### Core Components:
- **Agent**: Represents an autonomous unit capable of decision-making and learning.
- **Environment**: Represents the space or context in which the agent operates.
- **Recursive Planner**: A mechanism for the agent to plan actions recursively.
- **Learning Module**: Facilitates self-improvement and adaptability.

### Design:

```python
# ptm_autonomy.py

import random

class Environment:
    def __init__(self, state_space):
        self.state_space = state_space
    
    def get_possible_actions(self, state):
        # Example static implementation, can be enhanced.
        return ['move', 'collect', 'build']

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, environment):
        self.environment = environment
        self.state = random.choice(self.environment.state_space)
    
    def perceive_environment(self):
        # Simulate environment perception
        possible_actions = self.environment.get_possible_actions(self.state)
        return possible_actions

    def decide_action(self, possible_actions):
        # For simplicity, choosing a random action
        return random.choice(possible_actions)
    
    def execute_action(self, action):
        # Execute the chosen action and provide feedback loop
        print(f"Executing action: {action}")
        self.state = (self.state + 1) % len(self.environment.state_space)  # Simulate state change

class RecursivePlanner:
    def __init__(self, agent):
        self.agent = agent
    
    def plan(self, depth=3):
        return self.recursive_planning(self.agent.perceive_environment(), depth)
    
    def recursive_planning(self, actions, depth):
        if depth == 0 or not actions:
            return []
        print(f"Planning at depth {depth}: {actions}")
        action = self.agent.decide_action(actions)
        result_plan = [action] + self.recursive_planning(actions, depth-1)
        return result_plan

class LearningModule:
    def __init__(self, agent):
        self.agent = agent
    
    def update_knowledge(self, learning_data):
        # Update knowledge based on action feedback
        print("Updating knowledge base with:", learning_data)

class SelfEvolvingAutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self, state_space):
        self.environment = Environment(state_space)
        self.agent = Agent(self.environment)
        self.planner = RecursivePlanner(self.agent)
        self.learner = LearningModule(self.agent)
    
    def run(self):
        # Main execution cycle
        for _ in range(10):  # Arbitrary number of cycles
            plan = self.planner.plan()
            print("Planned actions:", plan)
            for action in plan:
                self.agent.execute_action(action)
                feedback = {"action": action, "state": self.agent.state}
                self.learner.update_knowledge(feedback)

# Example execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    stack = SelfEvolvingAutonomyStack(state_space=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
    stack.run()
```

### Key Points:
- **Recursive Planning**: The `RecursivePlanner` uses recursion to plan a sequence of actions.
- **Adaptability**: The `LearningModule` can adapt the agent's decision-making strategy based on feedback.
- **Modularity**: Separation of concerns between different components.
- **Scalability**: Easy to extend with more complex planning, learning, and perception mechanisms.

### Future Enhancements:
- **Advanced Learning**: Integrate with machine learning libraries for adaptive behavior.
- **Complex Environments**: Simulate more realistic and dynamic environments.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Support interactions between multiple autonomous agents.

By expanding the PTM empire's autonomy stack with such a module, the capability for self-organization, scalability, and adaptability can be significantly enhanced, supporting advanced autonomous operations.
