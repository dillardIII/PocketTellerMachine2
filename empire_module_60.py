Creating an advanced Python module for your "unstoppable PTM empire" with intelligent recursion involves designing a system that utilizes recursion in a smart and efficient way. This can be particularly useful for tasks that lend themselves to recursive solutions, such as traversing complex data structures or solving problems defined by recursive relationships, like the Fibonacci sequence or fractal designs.

Below, I'll provide an example of such a module. Let's assume we're building a system for solving problems using recursive strategies, providing features like memoization to optimize performance. We'll focus on solving mathematical and algorithmic problems where recursion is applicable.

```python
# Filename: ptm_recursive_toolkit.py

from functools import lru_cache
from typing import Callable, Dict, Any, Optional

class RecursiveSolver:
    def __init__(self, cache_size: Optional[int] = None):
        """Initialize the solver with an optional cache size for memoization."""
        self.cache_size = cache_size
    
    def memoize(self, func: Callable) -> Callable:
        """Decorator to apply memoization to a given function."""
        if self.cache_size is not None:
            return lru_cache(maxsize=self.cache_size)(func)
        return lru_cache(None)(func)

    def recursive_factorial(self, n: int) -> int:
        """Compute the factorial of a number using recursion."""
        @self.memoize
        def factorial(x: int) -> int:
            if x == 0:
                return 1
            else:
                return x * factorial(x - 1)
        
        return factorial(n)

    def recursive_fibonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        """Compute the nth Fibonacci number using recursion."""
        @self.memoize
        def fibonacci(x: int) -> int:
            if x <= 1:
                return x
            else:
                return fibonacci(x - 1) + fibonacci(x - 2)
        
        return fibonacci(n)

    def recursive_solver(self, func: Callable[[Any], Any], *args: Any) -> Any:
        """General-purpose method to solve a recursive problem using memoization."""
        @self.memoize
        def wrapper(x: Any) -> Any:
            return func(wrapper, x)
        
        return wrapper(*args)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solver = RecursiveSolver(cache_size=256)
    
    print("Factorial of 5:", solver.recursive_factorial(5))
    print("10th Fibonacci number:", solver.recursive_fibonacci(10))
    
    def custom_recursive_function(wrapper: Callable[[int], int], x: int) -> int:
        """Example of a custom recursive function to calculate sum of the first n integers."""
        if x <= 0:
            return 0
        return x + wrapper(x - 1)

    print("Sum of first 10 numbers:", solver.recursive_solver(custom_recursive_function, 10))
```

### Features of the Module:

1. **Memoization**: The `memoize` method applies Python's `lru_cache` to store results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

2. **Built-in Recursive Examples**: The module includes implementations of the factorial and Fibonacci sequence using intelligent recursion with memoization.

3. **General-purpose Recursive Solver**: The `recursive_solver` method allows you to pass your own recursive function and arguments to solve various recursive problems efficiently.

This module can be expanded with additional features or adapted for more specialized applications within your PTM empire. For example, you might add features for logging recursion depths, handling exceptions, or tracing recursion paths.
