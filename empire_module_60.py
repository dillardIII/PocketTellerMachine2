Creating a Python module that utilizes intelligent recursion requires both a clear understanding of recursion and the problem domain for the PTM (Pattern, Throughput, and Management) empire. While I don't have specific details about the PTM empire, I'll assume that it's a system that needs to efficiently process and optimize data patterns. Here's a conceptual framework for an advanced Python module using intelligent recursion that could hypothetically fit into such a system:

```python
# Filename: ptm_recursive_optimizer.py

from functools import lru_cache

class PTMRecursiveOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache_size = 128  # Cache size can be adjusted for performance tuning

    def optimize_pattern(self, data_pattern):
        """
        Public method to start the optimization of a given data pattern
        using intelligent recursion.
        
        :param data_pattern: List or nested structure representing the data.
        :return: Optimized data pattern result.
        """
        return self._recursive_optimize(tuple(data_pattern))

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def _recursive_optimize(self, data_pattern):
        """
        Recursively optimizes the data pattern using intelligent recursion
        with memoization to prevent redundant calculations.
        
        :param data_pattern: Tuple that represents the current data pattern state.
        :return: Optimized result for the current state.
        """
        # Base case for recursion
        if self._is_optimized(data_pattern):
            return self._process_optimized(data_pattern)

        # Recursive case: Decompose, solve subproblems, and combine results
        results = []
        for sub_pattern in self._decompose(data_pattern):
            optimized_sub_result = self._recursive_optimize(sub_pattern)
            results.append(optimized_sub_result)

        return self._combine_results(results)

    def _decompose(self, data_pattern):
        """
        Logic to decompose the data pattern into manageable sub-patterns.
        
        :param data_pattern: Tuple representing the current data pattern state.
        :return: Generator yielding sub-patterns for further optimization.
        """
        # For simplification, let's assume we simply split the data in half
        mid = len(data_pattern) // 2
        yield data_pattern[:mid]
        yield data_pattern[mid:]

    def _combine_results(self, results):
        """
        Logic to intelligently combine results of optimized sub-patterns.
        
        :param results: List of results from optimized sub-patterns.
        :return: Combined result from the optimized sub-patterns.
        """
        # Combine results by applying some optimization logic
        return sum(results)

    def _is_optimized(self, data_pattern):
        """
        Determines if a given pattern is already optimized.
        
        :param data_pattern: Tuple representing the current data pattern state.
        :return: Boolean, True if the pattern is optimized.
        """
        # Example check: negative values indicate not optimized
        return all(x >= 0 for x in data_pattern)

    def _process_optimized(self, data_pattern):
        """
        Processes a pattern that is already optimized.
        
        :param data_pattern: Tuple representing the current, already optimized data pattern.
        :return: Processed result for the given pattern.
        """
        # Simple example processing: sum the elements
        return sum(data_pattern)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    optimizer = PTMRecursiveOptimizer()
    data = [3, 1, -4, 7, -2, 5]
    optimized_result = optimizer.optimize_pattern(data)
    print(f"Optimized Result: {optimized_result}")
```

**Features of the Module:**

1. **Memoization:** The use of `functools.lru_cache` supports intelligent recursion by storing previous results and avoiding redundant calculations.

2. **Decomposition and Combination:** The approach separates a complex problem (decomposing the pattern) into more manageable subproblems, which are then solved and combined intelligently.

3. **Optimization Criteria:** The module makes decisions based on whether a sub-pattern is already optimized, potentially accelerating the recursion and reducing computational effort.

4. **Scalability:** It has the flexibility to adjust caching and pattern decomposition strategies.

This module is highly abstract as it assumes PTM operation details are around pattern optimization. Adjustments might be necessary to align with the actual requirements of the PTM empire.
