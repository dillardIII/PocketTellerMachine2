Creating an advanced Python module that showcases intelligent recursion can be a great way to leverage the power of recursive algorithms in a more efficient or sophisticated manner. Below, I'll outline a Python module that implements a few recursive algorithms with some intelligent enhancements, such as memoization or iterative deepening strategy, which can make them more efficient.

This example module will include:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence with Memoization**: An optimized recursive function for generating Fibonacci numbers using memoization to store previously computed results.
   
2. **Intelligent Factorial Computation**: A simple recursive factorial function to demonstrate how recursion can be applied to basic mathematical problems in an intelligent manner.

3. **Solving the N-Queens Problem Using Recursive Backtracking**: This classic problem will demonstrate intelligent recursion by exploring a backtracking approach to finding all solutions to placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.

4. **A Generic Recursive Tree Traversal**: An enhanced recursive traversal of a tree structure that can be used for various applications, demonstrating the versatility of recursion.

Here's the module code:

```python
# unstoppable_ptm.py

def fibonacci(n, memo=None):
    """Returns the n-th Fibonacci number using memoization."""
    if memo is None:
        memo = {}
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    memo[n] = fibonacci(n-1, memo) + fibonacci(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]

def factorial(n):
    """Returns the factorial of n using simple recursion."""
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)

def n_queens(n):
    """Solves the N-Queens problem and returns all solutions."""
    
    def is_safe(board, row, col):
        for i in range(col):
            if board[row][i] == 1:
                return False
        for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):
            if board[i][j] == 1:
                return False
        for i, j in zip(range(row, n, 1), range(col, -1, -1)):
            if board[i][j] == 1:
                return False
        return True

    def solve_nq_util(board, col):
        if col >= n:
            solution = []
            for r in board:
                solution.append(''.join(['Q' if x else '.' for x in r])):
            solutions.append(solution)
            return

        for i in range(n):
            if is_safe(board, i, col):
                board[i][col] = 1
                solve_nq_util(board, col + 1)
                board[i][col] = 0

    solutions = []
    board = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    solve_nq_util(board, 0)
    return solutions

def traverse_tree(node, visit_func):
    """Recursively traverses a tree and applies visit_func to each node."""
    visit_func(node)
    for child in getattr(node, "children", []):
        traverse_tree(child, visit_func)

# Example of how this module might be used in practice:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Fibonacci of 10:", fibonacci(10))
    print("Factorial of 5:", factorial(5))
    solutions = n_queens(4)
    print("N-Queens solutions for N=4:")
    for solution in solutions:
        for line in solution:
            print(line)
        print()
```

In this module:

- **Fibonacci** function uses memoization, storing results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Factorial** function is a straightforward recursive implementation.
- **N-Queens** uses recursive backtracking to explore all possible board configurations, using a safety check to ensure queens are not in attacking positions.
- **Traverse Tree** is a generic recursive function for tree traversal, applying a user-defined function (`visit_func`) to each node.

These functions provide a foundation for intelligent recursive strategies and demonstrate recursion's power and elegance.
