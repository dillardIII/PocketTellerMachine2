Creating an advanced Python module for the hypothetical "unstoppable PTM empire" with intelligent recursion would involve understanding your specific use case. However, I'll provide a generic Python module that demonstrates the principles of intelligent recursion. This module will include a recursive algorithm with optimizations such as memoization, and I'll assume PTM stands for "Pattern To Master" for illustrative purposes. Let's consider an example where we want to analyze patterns in data through recursive analysis.

Assume we are dealing with a scenario where we need to recursively process data points to identify repetitive patterns â€” potentially useful in data science or machine learning applications.

```python
# ptm_pattern_analyzer.py

from functools import lru_cache

class PatternToMaster:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.patterns = set()

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def analyze_patterns(self, start_index, pattern_length):
        """
        Analyze data to find recurring patterns using intelligent recursion.

        :param start_index: The starting index in the data to analyze from.
        :param pattern_length: The length of the pattern to look for.
        :return: None
        """
        if start_index + pattern_length > len(self.data):
            return
        
        # Extract a current pattern from the data
        current_pattern = tuple(self.data[start_index:start_index + pattern_length])
        
        # Store the current pattern in patterns set
        self.patterns.add(current_pattern)
        
        # Recursive call to analyze the next portion of the data
        self.analyze_patterns(start_index + 1, pattern_length)

    def extract_unique_patterns(self, min_length, max_length):
        """
        Extract unique patterns within the specified length range.

        :param min_length: Minimum length of patterns to analyze.
        :param max_length: Maximum length of patterns to analyze.
        :return: A set of unique patterns found.
        """
        for length in range(min_length, max_length + 1):
            self.analyze_patterns(0, length)
        return self.patterns

def demo():
    data = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
    ptm_analyzer = PatternToMaster(data)
    unique_patterns = ptm_analyzer.extract_unique_patterns(2, 3)
    print(f"Unique patterns found: {unique_patterns}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    demo()
```

### Explanation:

- **LRU Cache (Memoization):** Utilizes Python's `functools.lru_cache` to memoize results of the recursive function `analyze_patterns`, preventing repeated calculations for the same subset of data.
  
- **Recursive Pattern Analysis:** The `analyze_patterns` method recursively processes the data array, identifying patterns of specified lengths and storing them in a set to avoid duplicates.
  
- **Flexible Pattern Lengths:** The `extract_unique_patterns` method allows specification of a range for pattern length, enabling exploration of different potential patterns within the data.

- **Demonstration:** Provided a `demo()` function to illustrate how the module can be utilized.

This module can be further expanded based on specific domains of the PTM empire, such as integrating machine learning techniques, data visualization, or pattern prediction models. The intelligent use of recursion and memoization can significantly enhance the efficiency and applicability of pattern recognition operations within large datasets.
