Creating an advanced Python module with intelligent recursion requires careful consideration of design patterns, performance optimization, and ease of use. Below is a simplified example of such a module. We'll build a recursive computation engine that leverages memoization to efficiently solve problems like the Fibonacci sequence and customizable mathematical expressions. This module will also include logging for better traceability and debugging. 

```python
# unstoppable_ptm.py

import logging
from functools import lru_cache

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(levelname)s: %(message)s')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class PTMEngine:
    """
    PTMEngine is designed to perform complex recursive calculations
    with intelligent handling for optimization.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize a cache with a reasonable limit
        self._cache_limit = 1000
        
    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def fibonacci(self, n):
        """
        Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using memoization.
        :param n: Index of the Fibonacci sequence
        :return: nth Fibonacci number
        """
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Fibonacci number is not defined for negative indexes")
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        elif n == 1:
            return 1

        logger.debug(f"Computing Fibonacci for n={n}")
        return self.fibonacci(n - 1) + self.fibonacci(n - 2)
    
    def evaluate_expression(self, expression: str):
        """
        Recursively resolve and evaluate a mathematical expression.
        Currently supports only addition and subtraction with natural numbers.
        :param expression: A string with a mathematical expression.
        :return: The result of the evaluated expression.
        """
        logger.debug(f"Evaluating expression: {expression}")
        # Base case: if the expression is a number, return it as an integer.
        expression = expression.replace(" ", "")  # Remove spaces for simplicity
        if expression.isdigit():
            logger.debug(f"Reached base number: {expression}")
            return int(expression)

        # Recursive case: parse the expression and resolve operations.
        for operator in ('+', '-'):
            if operator in expression:
                left, right = expression.rsplit(operator, 1)
                logger.debug(f"Split expression into: {left} {operator} {right}")
                left_result = self.evaluate_expression(left)
                right_result = self.evaluate_expression(right)
                result = (left_result + right_result) if operator == '+' else (left_result - right_result)
                logger.debug(f"Result of {left} {operator} {right} is {result}")
                return result

        raise ValueError(f"Invalid expression format: {expression}")

def main():
    engine = PTMEngine()

    # Examples of using the PTMEngine
    try:
        fib_number = engine.fibonacci(10)
        logger.info(f"Fibonacci(10) = {fib_number}")

        expression_result = engine.evaluate_expression("10 + 20 - 5 + 3")
        logger.info(f"Result of expression '10 + 20 - 5 + 3' is {expression_result}")

    except ValueError as ve:
        logger.error(ve)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Module Explanation
1. **PTMEngine Class**: This class encapsulates functionalities such as calculating Fibonacci numbers and evaluating mathematical expressions.

2. **Memoization with `lru_cache`**: This decorator is used to cache the results of Fibonacci calculations to optimize performance.

3. **Expression Evaluation**: A recursive function to evaluate simple arithmetic expressions. It's simple but can be expanded to include more complex parsing logic and additional operations.

4. **Logging**: Allows us to track the function calls and results, facilitating debugging and understanding of program flow.

5. **Main Function**: Demonstrates usage of the PTMEngine functionalities.

This structure provides a robust foundation for building an intelligent recursive module within the PTM empire, which can be extended with additional recursive solutions and optimizations as needed.
