You can create a Python file that prints the desired message by following the steps below:

1. Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or even a simple one like Notepad.
2. Type the following line of code into the editor:

```python
print('PTM Empire is running fully autonomous Skypiea Neural Prediction in high risk mode!')
```

3. Save the file with a `.py` extension, for instance, `skypiea_mode.py`.

Here is the complete content for the `skypiea_mode.py` file:

```python
# skypiea_mode.py
print('PTM Empire is running fully autonomous Skypiea Neural Prediction in high risk mode!')
```

To run this script, open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and execute:

```sh
python skypiea_mode.py
```

Make sure that you have Python installed on your system. The script will print(the specified message to the console when executed.)
