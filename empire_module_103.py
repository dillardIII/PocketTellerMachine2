Creating an advanced Python module that leverages intelligent recursion for a hypothetical "unstoppable PTM empire" involves crafting an algorithm that can efficiently tackle complex problems using recursive methods. Let's build a module called `intelligent_recursion.py` with a focus on demonstrating advanced recursion techniques and optimization.

Here's a conceptual framework with example code:

```python
# intelligent_recursion.py

class UnstoppableRecursor:
    def __init__(self):
        # Cache for memoization to store previously computed results
        self.memo = {}

    def intelligent_factorial(self, n):
        """Compute factorial using intelligent recursion with memoization."""
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Negative values are not supported.")
        return self._factorial(n)

    def _factorial(self, n):
        """Private recursive method with memoization."""
        if n in (0, 1):
            return 1
        if n in self.memo:
            return self.memo[n]

        result = n * self._factorial(n - 1)
        self.memo[n] = result
        return result

    def intelligent_fibonacci(self, n):
        """Compute Fibonacci using intelligent recursion with memoization."""
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Negative values are not supported.")
        return self._fibonacci(n)

    def _fibonacci(self, n):
        """Private recursive method with memoization."""
        if n in (0, 1):
            return n
        if n in self.memo:
            return self.memo[n]

        result = self._fibonacci(n - 1) + self._fibonacci(n - 2)
        self.memo[n] = result
        return result

    def intelligent_solver(self, problem):
        """Generic intelligent recursion solver for arbitrary problems."""
        # Define a generic interface to solve recursive problems with optimization
        # This is a placeholder for complex problem-solving logic
        solution = self._solve(problem, {})
        return solution

    def _solve(self, problem, context):
        """
        Private recursive method that demonstrates possible use of recursion for complex problems.
        
        For demonstration, this method uses a simple recursive form and context management.
        
        Parameters:
            problem: A generic representation of a problem to solve.
            context: A dictionary or object to store state information.
        """
        # Check base case (simulated)
        if self.base_case(problem):
            return self.process_base_case(problem)

        if problem in self.memo:
            return self.memo[problem]

        # Recursive case
        sub_problems = self.decompose(problem)
        solution = self.combine(self._solve(sub_problem, context) for sub_problem in sub_problems)

        # Cache the result
        self.memo[problem] = solution
        return solution

    def base_case(self, problem):
        """Implement base case identification logic here."""
        return isinstance(problem, (int, float)) and problem <= 1

    def process_base_case(self, problem):
        """Process the base case and return a solution."""
        return problem

    def decompose(self, problem):
        """Decompose the problem into smaller sub-problems."""
        # Placeholder example of decomposing problems
        return [problem - 1, problem - 2]

    def combine(self, solutions):
        """Combine solutions from sub-problems into a complete solution."""
        return sum(solutions)

# Module usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    recursor = UnstoppableRecursor()
    print("Factorial of 5:", recursor.intelligent_factorial(5))
    print("Fibonacci of 7:", recursor.intelligent_fibonacci(7))
    print("Solving custom problem:", recursor.intelligent_solver(5))
```

### Key Features Explained:

1. **Memoization**: This classic optimization technique stores results of expensive function calls and reuses them when the same inputs occur again, reducing computation time.

2. **Generic Recursion Solver**: The `intelligent_solver` method is a template for solving generic recursive problems. The methods `base_case`, `process_base_case`, `decompose`, and `combine` are placeholders for customizing problem-specific logic.

3. **Error Handling**: Checks for invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers) with exceptions to ensure robustness.

4. **Extensibility**: The module is designed so that additional recursive problems can be integrated by extending the base class and implementing the necessary methods.

This setup is meant to be a starting point for building recursive solutions for complex problems, particularly in the context of a sophisticated and extensible system like an "unstoppable PTM empire."
