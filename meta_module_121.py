Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably an abbreviation for a specific concept or organization) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves a combination of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and systemic design principles. Below, I will outline a conceptual module that could serve part of such a stack, focusing on recursive learning and autonomy.

### Conceptual Module: `self_evo`

**Overview**: 
The `self_evo` module is designed to enhance the autonomy stack of the PTM empire by enabling recursive self-improvement and learning. The key innovative strategy here is to use recursive learning loops that continuously refine their models and strategies based on new data and outcomes.

#### Key Components

1. **Recursive Learning Agent**: The core of the module, capable of improving its performance over time. It uses a combination of reinforcement learning, neural networks, and evolutionary strategies.

2. **Environment Simulator**: A simulated environment where the agent can test its strategies before deploying them in real-world applications.

3. **Meta-Learning System**: Controls the learning process itself, deciding when to explore new strategies or exploit the current best strategy.

4. **Data Manager**: Manages the input and output data, including new data from environments, cleaning, feature extraction, and synthesizing data for better learning.

5. **Analyzer**: Evaluates the success of the model improvements and provides reports and metrics indicating performance over various benchmarks.

#### Recursive Strategies

- **Self-Play**: The agent engages in self-play to generate varied data from which to learn. This approach is effective in complex strategy games and real-world decision-making processes.

- **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning**: Breaks down tasks into sub-tasks, allowing for recursive training on more manageable components. This strategy facilitates scalability and complexity management.

- **Genetic Algorithms for Model Tuning**: Uses genetic algorithms to evolve model architectures and hyperparameters continuously. Recursive application leads to optimized network architectures over generations.

#### Code Example

```python
# self_evo module

import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from genetic_algorithm import GAOptimizer
from simulator import EnvironmentSimulator
from rl_agent import RecursiveAgent
from meta_learning import MetaLearner
from data_manager import DataManager
from analyzer import PerformanceAnalyzer

class SelfEvoModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.environment = EnvironmentSimulator()
        self.agent = RecursiveAgent()
        self.meta_learner = MetaLearner()
        self.data_manager = DataManager()
        self.analyzer = PerformanceAnalyzer()
        self.ga_optimizer = GAOptimizer()

    def recursive_learn(self, iterations=100):
        for i in range(iterations):
            data = self.data_manager.collect_data(self.environment)
            self.data_manager.preprocess_data(data)
            strategy = self.meta_learner.select_strategy()
            self.agent.train(strategy)
            performance = self.analyzer.evaluate(self.agent, self.environment)
            self.meta_learner.update(performance)
            self.ga_optimizer.evolve(self.agent.model)

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.recursive_learn()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sef_evo_module = SelfEvoModule()
    sef_evo_module.run()
```

### Explanation

- **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**: This module uses GA to optimize strategies through a survival-of-the-fittest approach, where only the best-performing strategies are carried forward.

- **Recursive Agent**: A specialized reinforcement learning agent capable of self-play and intrinsic motivation, continually learning through recursive tasks that build upon prior knowledge.

- **Meta-Learning**: Adjusts learning dynamics, switching between exploration (finding new strategies) and exploitation (optimizing existing strategies). It ensures that the learning process itself evolves over time.

### Future Considerations

- **Integration with Real-World Systems**: Ensure seamless integration with existing systems for real-time data ingestion and decision-making.

- **Ethical Considerations**: Implement safety checks and balances to prevent potentially unethical or unintended consequences.

- **Scalability**: Design the system to scale efficiently with increased data input and complex task requirements.

This example illustrates a high-level conceptual design for a Python module aimed at expanding an autonomy stack through recursive strategies. Depending on the specific needs and field of application of the PTM empire, these strategies and implementations might vary.
