Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional entity for the purpose of this exercise) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can enhance itself over time using recursive strategies. This approach will cater to continuous learning and adaptation, likely incorporating elements from machine learning, distributed computing, and genetic algorithms. Below is a conceptual outline of such a module:

### PTM Autonomy Enhancer Module

```python
# Initially, import necessary libraries
import random
import numpy as np
from copy import deepcopy
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Base class for Evolvable Components
class EvolvableComponent(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def mutate(self):
        """Apply a mutation to the component."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def evaluate(self):
        """Evaluate the fitness or performance of the component."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def clone(self):
        """Create a clone of the component."""
        pass

# Example Neural Network Component
class NeuralNetwork(EvolvableComponent):
    def __init__(self, layers):
        self.layers = layers  # List of layer definitions

    def mutate(self):
        # Randomly change weights or add/remove neurons
        for layer in self.layers:
            if random.random() < 0.1:  # 10% chance to mutate any weight:
                chosen_weight = random.choice(layer)
                chosen_weight += np.random.normal()
    
    def evaluate(self):
        # Evaluate the network on some predefined task
        return random.random()  # Placeholder for evaluation logic

    def clone(self):
        return deepcopy(self)

# Recursively evolving component manager
class EvolutionManager:
    def __init__(self, initial_population, survival_rate=0.5, mutation_rate=0.1):
        self.population = initial_population
        self.survival_rate = survival_rate
        self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate

    def evolve(self):
        # Evaluate all components
        scored_population = [(component, component.evaluate()) for component in self.population]

        # Select top performers
        scored_population.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        survivors = scored_population[:int(len(scored_population) * self.survival_rate)]

        # Reproduce and mutate
        new_population = []
        while len(new_population) < len(self.population):
            parent_a = random.choice(survivors)[0]
            parent_b = random.choice(survivors)[0]
            child = parent_a.clone()
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                child = parent_b.clone()

            if random.random() < self.mutation_rate:
                child.mutate()

            new_population.append(child)

        self.population = new_population

# Example task that uses the autonomy stack
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initial population with neural networks of varying layer sizes
    population = [NeuralNetwork(layers=[np.random.rand(random.randint(5, 10)) for _ in range(random.randint(2, 4))]) for _ in range(10)]

    evolution_manager = EvolutionManager(initial_population=population)
    
    # Run evolution for a number of generations
    generations = 100
    for generation in range(generations):
        evolution_manager.evolve()
        print(f"Generation {generation} completed.")

# Extend the module with additional strategies like distributed computation, self-testing, and deeper multi-component integration
```

### Key Components of the Module

1. **EvolvableComponent Base Class:**
    - Defines an interface for components that can mutate, evaluate their performance, and clone themselves.
    
2. **NeuralNetwork Class:**
    - An example of an evolvable component exploiting neural networks, illustrating mutation, evaluation, and cloning functionality.

3. **EvolutionManager:**
    - Manages the population of evolvable components, applying evolutionary principles like selection, mutation, and crossover.

4. **Recursive Strategies:**
    - The module recursively evaluates and evolves its components, ensuring continued improvement and adaptation to tasks.

5. **Self-Evolving:**
    - System behavior and performance should improve over generations without external input except for initial population configuration.

### Future Extensions

- **Distributed Computing:**
  - Implement a distributed architecture to manage large populations and increase computational efficiency.
  
- **Deep Integration:**
  - Integrate differing components offering varied functionalities (e.g., sensor integration, decision-making algorithms).

- **Adaptive Mutation:**
  - Enable mutation strategies that adapt based on environmental conditions or historical performance data.

By employing these recursive evolution strategies, the PTM empire's autonomy stack becomes a robust system capable of self-enhancement over time.
