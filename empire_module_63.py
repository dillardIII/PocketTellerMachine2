Creating an advanced Python module that utilizes intelligent recursion involves developing functions that efficiently solve complex problems through recursive approaches while optimizing resource usage, such as memory and computation time. Let's consider that the PTM empire needs a module that can handle advanced algorithmic problems suitable for large-scale applications. Here, I'll demonstrate how to design such a module with a focus on combinatorial problems, dynamic programming, and memoization techniques.

```python
# Filename: ptm_advanced_recursion.py

"""
PTM Advanced Recursion Module

This module provides advanced recursive algorithms optimized for performance
using intelligent techniques like memoization and dynamic recursion strategies.
"""

from functools import lru_cache
import sys

# Increase recursion limit for very deep recursive calls if necessary
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)

def intelligent_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Computes the nth Fibonacci number using memoization to optimize recursion.

    :param n: The position in the Fibonacci sequence.
    :return: The nth Fibonacci number.
    """
    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def fib(m):
        if m < 2:
            return m
        return fib(m - 1) + fib(m - 2)

    return fib(n)

def intelligent_factorial(n):
    """
    Computes the factorial of n using an intelligent recursion strategy.

    :param n: The number to find the factorial for.
    :return: The factorial of n.
    """
    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def factorial(m):
        if m == 0:
            return 1
        return m * factorial(m - 1)

    return factorial(n)

def intelligent_knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    """
    Solves the knapsack problem using dynamic programming with recursion.

    :param weights: List of item weights.
    :param values: List of item values.
    :param capacity: Maximum capacity of the knapsack.
    :return: Maximum value that can be taken in the knapsack.
    """
    n = len(weights)

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def knapsack(i, w):
        if i == 0 or w == 0:
            return 0
        if weights[i-1] > w:
            return knapsack(i-1, w)
        else:
            return max(knapsack(i-1, w), values[i-1] + knapsack(i-1, w-weights[i-1]))

    return knapsack(n, capacity)


def intelligent_subsets(nums):
    """
    Generates all possible subsets of a list of numbers using recursion.

    :param nums: List of numbers.
    :return: A list of all subsets.
    """
    def subsets_recursive(index):
        if index == len(nums):
            return [[]]
        subsets = subsets_recursive(index + 1)
        return subsets + [subset + [nums[index]] for subset in subsets]

    return subsets_recursive(0)

# For ease of use, export functions from the module
__all__ = [
    "intelligent_fibonacci",
    "intelligent_factorial",
    "intelligent_knapsack",
    "intelligent_subsets"
]

```

### Module Usage

1. **Fibonacci**:
   ```python
   from ptm_advanced_recursion import intelligent_fibonacci
   print(intelligent_fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
   ```

2. **Factorial**:
   ```python
   from ptm_advanced_recursion import intelligent_factorial
   print(intelligent_factorial(5))  # Output: 120
   ```

3. **Knapsack Problem**:
   ```python
   from ptm_advanced_recursion import intelligent_knapsack
   weights = [1, 2, 3]
   values = [60, 100, 120]
   capacity = 5
   print(intelligent_knapsack(weights, values, capacity))  # Output: Maximum value that fits in knapsack
   ```

4. **Subsets**:
   ```python
   from ptm_advanced_recursion import intelligent_subsets
   nums = [1, 2, 3]
   print(intelligent_subsets(nums))  # Output: All possible subsets
   ```

### Key Features

- **Memoization**: Achieved using Python's `lru_cache` to cache results of expensive function calls.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Utilized for problems like the knapsack to optimize decision making.
- **Recursive Strategies**: Implemented for clean, straightforward problem-solving approaches.
