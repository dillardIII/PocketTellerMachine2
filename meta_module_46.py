To design a new Python module that expands the PTM (Presumably a fictional empire here) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack, we need to incorporate innovative recursive strategies that enhance autonomy and adaptability. Here's a conceptual design for such a module:

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Key Components

1. **Recursive Learning System (RLS):**
   - **Purpose:** Continuously evolve the learning algorithms by recursively refining models based on new data and outcomes.
   - **Components:**
     - `update_model`: Refines existing models using incoming data.
     - `recursive_refinement`: Applies feedback loops to adjust learning parameters.
     - `model_repository`: Stores and manages different model versions for rollbacks and testing.

2. **Self-Healing Mechanism:**
   - **Purpose:** Detect and recover from failures autonomously.
   - **Components:**
     - `failure_detector`: Monitors system health and detects anomalies.
     - `repair_executor`: Initiates predefined repair strategies or retrains models.
     - `self_diagnostic`: Performs system checks and validates successful recoveries.

3. **Adaptive Decision-Making (ADM):**
   - **Purpose:** Respond intelligently to dynamic environments through recursive decision adjustments.
   - **Components:**
     - `decision_maker`: Evaluates current state and outcomes to select optimal actions.
     - `feedback_integration`: Continuously updates decision criteria based on past actions and new data.
     - `scenario_simulator`: Runs simulations to forecast possible outcomes of various decisions.

4. **Collaborative Learning Network (CLN):**
   - **Purpose:** Leverage distributed learning by enabling systems to share knowledge.
   - **Components:**
     - `peer_communicator`: Facilitates data and model exchange between nodes.
     - `ensemble_learning`: Combines insights from multiple systems to refine models.
     - `consensus_builder`: Agrees on best practices through collective decision-making.

5. **Resource Optimization Engine (ROE):**
   - **Purpose:** Efficiently manage and allocate resources based on recursive evaluations.
   - **Components:**
     - `resource_allocator`: Dynamically assigns resources based on current needs.
     - `utilization_analyzer`: Monitors and predicts future resource requirements.
     - `efficiency_optimizer`: Integrates recursive feedback for continuous improvement.

### Sample Implementation (Skeleton Code)

Here's a basic skeleton of how the module might be structured:

```python
class PTMAutonomy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = ModelRepository()
        self.failure_detector = FailureDetector()
        self.repair_executor = RepairExecutor()
        self.decision_maker = DecisionMaker()
        self.peer_communicator = PeerCommunicator()
        self.resource_allocator = ResourceAllocator()

    def update_model(self, data):
        """Refines the models using new data."""
        self.models.update(data)

    def self_heal(self):
        """Executes self-healing routines if any failures are detected.""":
        if self.failure_detector.detect():
            self.repair_executor.execute()

    def make_decision(self, state):
        """Adjusts decision making based on feedback."""
        optimal_action = self.decision_maker.evaluate(state)
        return optimal_action

    def share_knowledge(self, peer_system):
        """Shares learning with a peer system."""
        insights = self.peer_communicator.exchange(peer_system)
        self.models.refine_with_ensemble(insights)

    def optimize_resources(self):
        """Assigns resources efficiently based on analysis."""
        self.resource_allocator.allocate()

# Placeholder classes for underlying complex logic
class ModelRepository:
    def update(self, data):
        pass

class FailureDetector:
    def detect(self):
        pass

class RepairExecutor:
    def execute(self):
        pass

class DecisionMaker:
    def evaluate(self, state):
        pass

class PeerCommunicator:
    def exchange(self, peer_system):
        pass

class ResourceAllocator:
    def allocate(self):
        pass
```

### Considerations

- **Scalability:** Ensure the module can handle large-scale operations as the PTM empire grows.
- **Security:** Implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access or data corruption.
- **Interoperability:** Design the module to be easily integrated with existing systems within the PTM infrastructure.
- **Testing and Validation:** Regularly test the module in varied environments to validate its performance and reliability.

This design provides a modular approach to developing a self-evolving autonomy stack for the PTM empire. Tailoring these strategies to the specific needs and constraints of your systems will ensure maximal effectiveness.
