Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably Project or Platform Technology Management) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating robust recursive strategies to aid in continuous improvement and adaptation. Here's an outline of how you might structure such a module, followed by a sample code snippet demonstrating some of these concepts:

### Module Outline

**Module Name**: `self_evolving_stack`

#### Key Components:
1. **Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI) Engine**:
   - Leverages machine learning to recursively improve algorithms.
   - Continuously evaluates and upgrades its models and strategies.

2. **Autonomous Decision Making**:
   - Implements recursive decision-making processes.
   - Uses feedback loops to refine decision accuracy over time.

3. **Adaptation & Learning Framework**:
   - Capable of identifying and adapting to new patterns or anomalies.
   - Integrates reinforcement learning for iterative improvement.

4. **Integration & Interoperability**:
   - Seamlessly connects with other modules in the PTM ecosystem.
   - Utilizes APIs for communication and data exchange.

5. **Safety & Ethics Layer**:
   - Ensures all recursive improvements align with ethical guidelines and safety standards.
   - Includes a rollback mechanism in case of undesirable changes.

### Sample Code Snippet

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import logging

# Configuring logging to keep track of system performance and changes
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class RecursiveImprovementEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier()
        self.data = None
        self.labels = None

    def load_data(self, data, labels):
        self.data = data
        self.labels = labels

    def evaluate_and_improve(self):
        if self.data is None or self.labels is None:
            raise ValueError("Data not loaded.")

        # Split the data
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
            self.data, self.labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
        )

        # Fit the model
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions = self.model.predict(X_test)
        baseline_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
        logging.info(f"Baseline accuracy: {baseline_accuracy}")

        # Recursive improvement loop
        iteration = 0
        previous_accuracy = 0
        while baseline_accuracy > previous_accuracy:
            previous_accuracy = baseline_accuracy
            # Assume some improvement to the model (e.g., hyperparameter tuning)
            self.model = RandomForestClassifier(
                n_estimators=self.model.n_estimators + 10
            )
            self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
            predictions = self.model.predict(X_test)
            baseline_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
            logging.info(f"Iteration {iteration} accuracy: {baseline_accuracy}")
            iteration += 1

        logging.info("Optimal model achieved.")

    def predict(self, input_data):
        return self.model.predict(input_data)


# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example data (replace with real data)
    data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    labels = np.random.randint(2, size=100)

    # Initialize and use the recursive improvement engine
    rsi_engine = RecursiveImprovementEngine()
    rsi_engine.load_data(data, labels)
    rsi_engine.evaluate_and_improve()

    # Predict with the improved model
    new_data = np.random.rand(5, 10)
    predictions = rsi_engine.predict(new_data)
    logging.info(f"Predictions on new data: {predictions}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Recursive Improvement**: The `evaluate_and_improve` method incorporates a loop that evaluates the model, logs its performance, and adjusts its parameters recursively until the modelâ€™s accuracy no longer improves. This is a simple form of a recursive self-improvement strategy.

2. **Safety**: Log outputs are used to ensure transparency and facilitate rollback if necessary.

3. **Integration**: The modular design makes it easy to extend this framework to include more complex models, integrate additional databases, or communicate with other systems in the PTM ecosystem.

4. **Adaptation & Learning**: The basic premise is demonstrated by hyperparameter tuning of a Random Forest model, which could be expanded with more sophisticated machine learning techniques and broader adaptation mechanisms like reinforcement learning.
