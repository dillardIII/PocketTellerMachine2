Creating a strategy or empire utility in Python can involve a variety of components, such as resource management, decision-making processes, and scenario simulations. Below, Iâ€™m providing a simple framework for a resource management tool in a fictional empire-building game. This utility will help manage resources, track assets, and guide decision-making based on current empire status.

```python
class EmpireResourceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize resources
        self.resources = {
            'gold': 1000,
            'wood': 500,
            'stone': 300,
            'food': 700,
        }
        
        # Initialize buildings that require resources to build or maintain
        self.buildings = {
            'farm': {'cost': 100, 'maintenance': 5, 'production': {'food': 10}},
            'sawmill': {'cost': 150, 'maintenance': 10, 'production': {'wood': 15}},
            'mine': {'cost': 200, 'maintenance': 20, 'production': {'stone': 20, 'gold': 5}},
        }
        
        # List of constructed buildings
        self.constructed_buildings = {
            'farm': 1,
            'sawmill': 1,
            'mine': 0,
        }
        
    def construct_building(self, building_name):
        if building_name in self.buildings:
            cost = self.buildings[building_name]['cost']
            if self.resources['gold'] >= cost:
                self.resources['gold'] -= cost
                self.constructed_buildings[building_name] += 1
                print(f"{building_name.capitalize()} constructed!")
            else:
                print(f"Not enough gold to construct {building_name}. Need {cost - self.resources['gold']} more gold.")
        else:
            print(f"Invalid building: {building_name}")

    def collect_resources(self):
        print("Collecting resources from buildings...")
        for building, count in self.constructed_buildings.items():
            if count > 0:
                for resource, amount in self.buildings[building]['production'].items():
                    self.resources[resource] += amount * count

    def update_resources_for_maintenance(self):
        print("Updating resources for building maintenance...")
        total_maintenance = 0
        for building, count in self.constructed_buildings.items():
            if count > 0:
                maintenance = self.buildings[building]['maintenance'] * count
                if self.resources['gold'] >= maintenance:
                    total_maintenance += maintenance
                else:
                    print(f"Cannot afford maintenance for {building}. Missing {maintenance - self.resources['gold']} gold.")
                    return False
        self.resources['gold'] -= total_maintenance
        print(f"Total maintenance cost: {total_maintenance} gold")
        return True

    def display_resources(self):
        print("Current Resources:")
        for resource, amount in self.resources.items():
            print(f"{resource.capitalize()}: {amount}")

    def make_decision(self):
        if self.resources['food'] < 200:
            print("Food levels are low. Constructing more farms.")
            self.construct_building('farm')
        elif self.resources['wood'] < 100:
            print("Wood levels are low. Constructing more sawmills.")
            self.construct_building('sawmill')
        elif self.resources['stone'] < 100:
            print("Stone levels are low. Constructing more mines.")
            self.construct_building('mine')
        else:
            print("Resources are stable. Expanding empire resources.")
            self.construct_building('farm')

def main():
    empire = EmpireResourceManager()
    for _ in range(5):  # Simulate 5 turns
        empire.display_resources()
        empire.collect_resources()
        if not empire.update_resources_for_maintenance():
            print("Maintenance failed. Consider revising your strategy.")
            break
        empire.make_decision()
        print("=" * 30)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The script initializes with a set amount of resources and a few buildings that contribute to resource production.
2. **Construction**: It allows constructing new buildings, with resource checks ensuring buildings are only constructed if there are enough resources.:
3. **Collection and Maintenance**: It simulates turns where resources are collected, and maintenance costs are calculated and deducted from available resources.
4. **Decision-Making**: Based on current resources, the utility makes decisions on what buildings to construct to optimize resource levels.
5. **Simulation**: The main function runs a simple simulation of 5 turns, demonstrating how the utility works and how resources are managed and used strategically. 

This simple utility could be expanded further with more complex decision-making logic, additional building types, and external events affecting the empire's status.
