Certainly! Let's create a Python utility that models a simple resource management system for an empire. This utility will simulate basic resource collection, building construction, and military expansion, providing a foundation for a strategy game or empire simulation. We'll call it `EmpireManager`.

```python
import random
import time

class EmpireManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.resources = {'gold': 100, 'wood': 100, 'stone': 100}
        self.troops = {'infantry': 10, 'archers': 5}
        self.buildings = {'farms': 1, 'barracks': 1}
        self.disaster_chance = 0.1

    def gather_resources(self):
        bonus_farms = self.buildings['farms'] * 5
        self.resources['gold'] += random.randint(5, 10) + bonus_farms
        self.resources['wood'] += random.randint(5, 10) + bonus_farms
        self.resources['stone'] += random.randint(5, 10) + bonus_farms
        print("Resources have been gathered: ", self.resources)

    def build(self, building_type):
        costs = {'farms': {'wood': 20, 'stone': 10},
                 'barracks': {'wood': 50, 'stone': 50}}
        if building_type in costs and all(self.resources[res] >= costs[building_type][res] for res in costs[building_type]):
            for res in costs[building_type]:
                self.resources[res] -= costs[building_type][res]
            self.buildings[building_type] += 1
            print(f"{building_type.capitalize()} has been constructed.")
        else:
            print(f"Not enough resources to build {building_type} or incorrect building type.")

    def train_troops(self, troop_type, number):
        costs = {'infantry': {'gold': 10, 'wood': 5},
                 'archers': {'gold': 15, 'wood': 10}}
        
        if troop_type in costs:
            total_cost = {res: costs[troop_type][res] * number for res in costs[troop_type]}
            if all(self.resources[res] >= total_cost[res] for res in total_cost):
                for res in total_cost:
                    self.resources[res] -= total_cost[res]
                self.troops[troop_type] += number
                print(f"{number} {troop_type} have been trained.")
            else:
                print(f"Not enough resources to train {number} {troop_type}.")
        else:
            print("Invalid troop type.")

    def check_disaster(self):
        if random.random() < self.disaster_chance:
            lost_gold = min(self.resources['gold'], random.randint(10, 30))
            self.resources['gold'] -= lost_gold
            print(f"Disaster strikes! {lost_gold} gold has been lost.")

    def status(self):
        print("\nCurrent Empire Status")
        print("Resources:", self.resources)
        print("Troops:", self.troops)
        print("Buildings:", self.buildings)

    def run_simulation(self, steps=10):
        for step in range(steps):
            print(f"\n--- Turn {step+1} ---")
            self.gather_resources()
            self.check_disaster()
            action = random.choice(['build', 'train'])
            if action == 'build':
                self.build(random.choice(['farms', 'barracks']))
            elif action == 'train':
                self.train_troops(random.choice(['infantry', 'archers']), random.randint(1, 3))
            self.status()
            time.sleep(1)

# Create an instance of the EmpireManager
empire = EmpireManager()

# Run the simulation for a number of turns
empire.run_simulation(steps=5)
```

### Explanation

1. **Resources**: The empire starts with an initial allocation of resources â€” gold, wood, and stone.
2. **Buildings**: The empire can construct farms and barracks, each providing some benefits.
3. **Troops**: The empire can train two types of troops: infantry and archers.
4. **Random Events**: A simple disaster mechanism randomly reduces resources.
5. **Actions**: The simulation chooses between building and training troops randomly.
6. **Simulation**: A basic loop tracks several turns, automatically gathering resources and performing actions.

This utility could serve as a starting point for a text-based strategy game and could be further expanded with more complex dynamics and interactions.
