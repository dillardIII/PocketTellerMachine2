Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "Partially Autonomous Transportation Modules" or similar if PTM refers to something specific in your context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack would involve designing a system that can learn and adapt over time. The module would likely employ machine learning, AI, and advanced algorithmic strategies to improve decision-making and autonomy. Here’s a high-level outline for such a module, incorporating recursive strategies for continuous improvement and adaptation.

### Overview

The module will be called `ptm_autonomy`. It would be structured to include components for sensory data processing, decision-making, learning, and evolving capabilities. The recursive strategy involves the self-assessment and improvement loop, enabling the PTM units to become smarter and more autonomous over time.

### Core Functionalities

1. **Sensory Data Processing**  
   - Incorporate sensors APIs to collect real-time data.
   - Data normalization and filtering to ensure reliable input for further processing.
   - Pattern recognition for obstacle detection and environment mapping.

2. **Decision-Making**  
   - Use AI techniques such as neural networks for real-time decision-making.
   - Implement a rule-based system that can be dynamically updated as new patterns are learned.

3. **Learning Mechanism**  
   - Supervised and unsupervised learning models to continuously improve navigation and decision algorithms.
   - Reinforcement learning to adapt and optimize behavior based on success/failure metrics.

4. **Self-Evolving Strategy**  
   - Recursive self-assessment loop to evaluate performance and update decision-making models.
   - Genetic algorithms to explore and adopt new strategies based on evolutionary techniques.
   - AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) to automate the model selection and tuning processes.

5. **Communication Between Units**  
   - A distributed system for communication between different PTM units to share experiences and learn collectively.

#### Sample Content of Each Module

- **sensors.py**: This would include classes and methods for handling different types of sensor data, possibly using asynchronous programming to manage real-time inputs.

```python
class SensorManager:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # Initialize sensors
    
    def collect_data(self):
        pass  # Collects and processes data from sensors

    def normalize_data(self, data):
        pass  # Normalizes data for use in algorithms
```

- **decision_making.py**: Core decision-making algorithms based on AI models.

```python
from models import NeuralNetwork

class DecisionEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = NeuralNetwork()

    def make_decision(self, data):
        return self.model.predict(data)
```

- **learning.py**: Organize functions for model training and improvement.

```python
class LearningModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = []  # List of trained models
    
    def train_model(self, data, target):
        pass  # Implementation of training procedures

    def evaluate_model_performance(self, model, test_data):
        pass  # Evaluate and return model performance
```

- **evolution.py**: Implement evolutionary strategies to enhance autonomy.

```python
class EvolutionaryStrategy:
    def evolve_parameters(self):
        pass  # Genetic algorithm to find optimal parameters

    def recursive_assessment(self, performance_data):
        pass  # Recursive evaluation and adjustment of strategies
```

- **communication.py**: Methods for inter-module communication.

```python
class CommunicationModule:
    def broadcast_message(self, message):
        pass  # Send messages to other PTMs

    def receive_message(self):
        pass  # Receive messages from other PTMs
```

- **utils.py**: Helper functions and classes for common operations.

```python
def log_event(event):
    pass  # Logging utility for event recording
```

### Recursive Strategies

- Use **Reinforcement Learning** algorithms such as Q-Learning or Deep Q Networks, which inherently adopt a recursive approach to policy improvement over time.
- Apply **Genetic Algorithms** where models evolve and cross-breed over generations to find optimized solutions and update the autonomy stack dynamically.
- Implement **AutoML** for automated recursive processes in model improvement and feature selection, leveraging libraries like AutoKeras or TPOT.
  
This outline provides a robust foundation for designing a Python module that expands the PTM empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack. The recursive strategies ensure continuous learning and adaptation, making the system increasingly autonomous and capable over time.
