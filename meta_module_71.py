Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "Pre-trained Model" such as those by OpenAI) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires thoughtful consideration of several factors: architectural improvements, integration capabilities, recursion strategies, and scalability.

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy`

This module will focus on autonomous decision-making, iterative self-improvement, and self-evolving capabilities. We'll incorporate a recursive learning strategy alongside traditional reinforcement learning principles to build a resilient and self-improving system.

#### Key Components

1. **Recursive Learning Strategy**
2. **Meta-Learning with Dynamic Updating**
3. **Self-monitoring & Evaluation**
4. **Scalability & Integration**

#### 1. Recursive Learning Strategy

Recursive learning can be designed by enabling the model to fine-tune itself on tasks using its own evaluations as feedback:

```python
class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, model, evaluation_metric, recursive_depth=3):
        self.model = model
        self.evaluation_metric = evaluation_metric
        self.recursive_depth = recursive_depth
        
    def learn(self, task_data):
        for i in range(self.recursive_depth):
            predictions = self.model.predict(task_data)
            feedback = self.self_evaluate(predictions)
            self.model = self.update_model(task_data, feedback)
        return self.model
    
    def self_evaluate(self, predictions):
        # Implement evaluation metric to generate feedback
        feedback = self.evaluation_metric(predictions)
        return feedback
    
    def update_model(self, task_data, feedback):
        # Update model parameters based on feedback
        self.model.update(task_data, feedback)
        return self.model
```

#### 2. Meta-Learning with Dynamic Updating

Meta-learning can be structured to allow models to quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal data, thus propelling autonomy:

```python
class MetaLearner:
    def __init__(self, base_model):
        self.base_model = base_model
        
    def adapt(self, few_shot_data):
        adapted_model = self.base_model.clone()
        adapted_model.train(few_shot_data)
        return adapted_model
    
    def dynamic_update(self, new_data):
        # Perform updates only if new data enhances performance:
        improvement = self.evaluate_improvement(new_data)
        if improvement:
            self.base_model = self.adapt(new_data)
            
    def evaluate_improvement(self, new_data):
        # Mock function to evaluate performance increase
        return True
```

#### 3. Self-monitoring & Evaluation

This component will ensure continuous evaluation and self-diagnosis of the system's performance and reliability:

```python
class SelfMonitor:
    def __init__(self, model, validation_data):
        self.model = model
        self.validation_data = validation_data
        
    def run_diagnostics(self):
        results = self.model.evaluate(self.validation_data)
        self.log_results(results)
        
    def log_results(self, results):
        # Log results for future reference and tuning
        print("Diagnostic Evaluation:", results)
    
    def trigger_self_correction(self):
        # Trigger corrective measures if performance drops:
        print("Performance degradation detected! Initiating corrective measures.")
        # Implements correction strategies
```

#### 4. Scalability & Integration

A robust API allows for seamless integration and scalability across various platforms and architectures:

```python
class IntegrationAPI:
    def __init__(self, learner):
        self.learner = learner
        
    def integrate_with_system(self, external_system_interface):
        # Code for integrating with an external system
        external_system_interface.bind(self.learner)
        print("Integration successful")
        
    def scale_across_nodes(self, computation_nodes):
        # Logic to distribute learning across nodes
        for node in computation_nodes:
            node.run(self.learner)
        print(f"Scaled across {len(computation_nodes)} nodes")
```

### Conclusion

The `ptm_autonomy` module provides an advanced framework for creating self-evolving autonomous systems. Its novel recursive learning and meta-learning strategies aim to enhance adaptability, making it applicable for complex, dynamic environments. Continuous self-monitoring ensures robust performance, while its scalable integration capabilities facilitate widespread adoption and evolution. 

The module should be integrated with existing PTM systems to further expand and solidify its autonomy stack.
