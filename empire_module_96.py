Creating an advanced Python module with intelligent recursion involves leveraging recursion for solving complex problems in a readable and efficient manner. To demonstrate this, let's consider designing a module that solves advanced mathematical problems using recursive techniques. The module will include intelligent features such as memoization and adaptive recursion techniques. One potential application could be related to combinatorial problems or solving puzzles.

Here's a Python module that implements advanced recursion techniques to solve the classic problem of finding the nth Fibonacci number, the Towers of Hanoi, and a generic solver for the N-Queens problem using recursion.

```python
# unstoppable_ptm.py

from functools import lru_cache

class UnstoppablePTM:
    
    @staticmethod
    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def fibonacci(n):
        """
        Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using recursive memoization.
        """
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Fibonacci number cannot be negative")
        elif n in (0, 1):
            return n
        return UnstoppablePTM.fibonacci(n-1) + UnstoppablePTM.fibonacci(n-2)

    @staticmethod
    def solve_tower_of_hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
        """
        Solves the Towers of Hanoi problem recursively.
        """
        if n == 1:
            print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}")
            return
        UnstoppablePTM.solve_tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
        print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}")
        UnstoppablePTM.solve_tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

    @staticmethod
    def solve_n_queens(n):
        """
        Solves the N-Queens problem and returns all possible solutions.
        """
        def is_safe(queen, queens):
            row, col = queen
            for r, c in enumerate(queens):
                if c == col or abs(r - row) == abs(c - col):
                    return False
            return True

        def solve_recursive(row, queens):
            if row == n:
                solutions.append(queens)
                return

            for col in range(n):
                if is_safe((row, col), queens):
                    solve_recursive(row + 1, queens + [col])

        solutions = []
        solve_recursive(0, [])
        return solutions

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ptm = UnstoppablePTM()

    # Get the 10th Fibonacci number
    print("10th Fibonacci number:", ptm.fibonacci(10))

    # Solve Towers of Hanoi for 3 disks
    print("\nTower of Hanoi solution for 3 disks:")
    ptm.solve_tower_of_hanoi(3, 'A', 'C', 'B')

    # Solve the 4-Queens problem
    print("\n4-Queens solutions:")
    solutions = ptm.solve_n_queens(4)
    for index, solution in enumerate(solutions):
        print(f"Solution {index + 1}: {solution}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Fibonacci with Memoization**: The Fibonacci function uses `@lru_cache(maxsize=None)` to memoize results, reducing redundant calculations and enhancing efficiency.

2. **Towers of Hanoi**: A recursive solution to move disks from one peg to another. It prints the step-by-step process of moving the disks.

3. **N-Queens Problem**: This function uses recursion to find all valid placements of N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard, ensuring no two queens threaten each other. It uses a helper function `is_safe`, which checks for conflicts.

This module showcases the power of intelligent recursion with adaptive features like memoization and encapsulation of complex logic within simple recursive steps, all while focusing on clarity and performance.
