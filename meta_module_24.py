Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional organization focused on autonomous technologies) empireâ€™s self-evolving autonomy stack involves incorporating advanced recursive strategies that allow the system to learn, adapt, and improve over time. Below is a high-level overview of a potential module design, highlighting key components and strategies you might implement.

### Module: AdaptiveRecursiveAutonomy

#### Key Features:
1. **Recursive Learning Models**:
   - Incorporate learning algorithms that can recursively analyze and learn from new data.
   - Use neural networks with recursive feedback loops to update learning parameters over time.

2. **Self-Optimization Engine**:
   - Implement optimization algorithms that recursively evaluate the performance of various components and adjust them based on success metrics.
   - Leverage genetic algorithms to evolve strategies over multiple iterations.

3. **Autonomous Decision-Making**:
   - Recursive decision trees for scalable decision-making processes, capable of adjusting strategies based on historical outcomes.
   - Use Markov Decision Processes (MDP) for modeling decision-making in environments with probabilistic outcomes.

4. **Feedback Loops**:
   - Create robust feedback loops to ensure the timely adaptation of models and algorithms.
   - Implement sensors and data streams as inputs that feed back into the learning models for real-time updates.

5. **Simulation and Scenario Analysis**:
   - Develop simulation environments to recursively test strategies in a controlled setting.
   - Use these simulations to conduct scenario analysis and predict future states, continuously refining the autonomy stack.

#### Sample Code

Below is a simplified example structure of how you might start designing the `AdaptiveRecursiveAutonomy` module:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

class AdaptiveRecursiveAutonomy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.decision_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier()
        self.neural_network = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(50, 50),
                                           activation='relu', solver='adam')
        self.performance_metrics = []

    def recursive_learning(self, data, targets):
        # Train decision tree and neural network with initial data
        self.decision_tree.fit(data, targets)
        self.neural_network.fit(data, targets)

    def self_optimize(self, func_to_optimize, initial_guess):
        result = minimize(func_to_optimize, initial_guess)
        self.performance_metrics.append(result.fun)
        return result.x

    def autonomous_decision_making(self, input_data):
        decision = self.decision_tree.predict(input_data)
        return decision

    def feedback_loop(self, new_data):
        # Simulate recursive updating
        predictions = self.neural_network.predict(new_data)
        self.recursive_learning(new_data, predictions)

    def simulate_and_adapt(self, environment):
        while True:
            # Run simulation
            simulated_data = environment.run()
            # Continuously adapt the models
            self.feedback_loop(simulated_data)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    adaptive_system = AdaptiveRecursiveAutonomy()
    # Example data (replace with real data)
    initial_data, initial_targets = np.random.rand(100, 10), np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
    adaptive_system.recursive_learning(initial_data, initial_targets)
    optimized_params = adaptive_system.self_optimize(lambda x: np.sum(x**2), np.random.rand(10))
    decisions = adaptive_system.autonomous_decision_making(np.random.rand(10))
```

### Further Considerations
1. **Scalability and Efficiency**: Ensure the module can handle large datasets efficiently, possibly using parallel processing or distributed systems.
2. **Security**: Incorporate security measures to protect data and decision-making processes.
3. **Ethical Considerations**: Implement ethical guidelines to govern autonomous decision-making, ensuring compliance with regulations and societal norms.
4. **Extensibility**: Design the module to be easily extensible with plugins or additional layers of autonomy.

This architecture provides a foundational framework for building a self-evolving autonomy stack with recursive learning and decision-making capabilities. As the module is implemented, integrate additional advanced algorithms and adapt the components to the specific needs and goals of the PTM empire.
