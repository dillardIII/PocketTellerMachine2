Creating a module that evolves ghost memory weights based on the last 10 trades involves designing a system where the significance or "weight" of each past trade adapts dynamically as new information becomes available. This concept can be useful in trading algorithms where recent trades should influence decision-making to different extents based on their relevance.

Here's a Python module that demonstrates a simple implementation of such a system. This example uses a weighted moving average (WMA) strategy, where the weights are adjusted based on the trades' outcomes and timespan.

```python
import numpy as np

class GhostMemory:
    def __init__(self, memory_size=10):
        """
        Initialize the GhostMemory instance.
        
        :param memory_size: Number of trades to remember.
        """
        self.memory_size = memory_size
        self.trades = []
        self.weights = np.linspace(1, 0.1, memory_size)[::-1]

    def add_trade(self, trade_value):
        """
        Add a new trade to the memory.
        
        :param trade_value: The value of the trade.
        """
        if len(self.trades) >= self.memory_size:
            self.trades.pop(0)
        self.trades.append(trade_value)
        
    def update_weights(self):
        """
        Update the weights based on the performance of past trades.
        This method is a placeholder for implementing custom logic.
        """
        # Example logic: Increase weight for positive trades, decrease for negative
        for i in range(len(self.trades)):
            if self.trades[i] > 0:
                self.weights[i] += 0.1  # Arbitrary increase
            else:
                self.weights[i] = max(0.1, self.weights[i] - 0.1)  # Decrease but not below 0.1
        self.normalize_weights()

    def normalize_weights(self):
        """
        Normalize the weights so that they sum to 1.
        """
        total_weight = sum(self.weights)
        if total_weight != 0:
            self.weights = [w / total_weight for w in self.weights]

    def calculate_weighted_average(self):
        """
        Calculate the weighted average of the trades.
        
        :return: The weighted average of the trades.
        """
        if not self.trades:
            return 0
        weighted_sum = sum(t * w for t, w in zip(self.trades, self.weights[len(self.weights)-len(self.trades):]))
        return weighted_sum

    def process_trade(self, trade_value):
        """
        Process a new trade and update the system accordingly.
        
        :param trade_value: The value of the trade.
        :return: The updated weighted average of the trades.
        """
        self.add_trade(trade_value)
        self.update_weights()
        return self.calculate_weighted_average()

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    gm = GhostMemory(memory_size=10)
    trades = [1, -2, 3, -1, 5, 4, -3, 2, -4, 1]

    for trade in trades:
        weighted_avg = gm.process_trade(trade)
        print(f"Processed trade {trade}: Weighted Average = {weighted_avg:.2f}")
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: The `GhostMemory` class takes a `memory_size` parameter, which is the number of recent trades to consider.
- **Adding Trades**: Trades are added to a list, ensuring it doesn't exceed the specified memory size.
- **Weight Update**: A placeholder method `update_weights()` is provided to adjust weights based on custom logic (e.g., trade outcomes). Here, positive trade values slightly increase their associated weight, while negative values decrease it.
- **Normalization**: The weights are normalized to sum to 1, which is crucial for appropriately calculating the weighted average.
- **Calculating Averages**: The `calculate_weighted_average()` method computes the weighted average of the trades with their respective weights.
- **Processing Trades**: The `process_trade()` function processes new trades and returns the updated weighted average.

This framework is adaptable and can be modified with more sophisticated logic for evolving weights based on additional trading indicators or metrics.
