Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional entity) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a combination of state-of-the-art concepts in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software engineering. This module will harness recursive strategies to ensure continuous learning and adaptability. Below is a high-level design of such a module:

### Self-Evolving Autonomy Stack Module

#### Key Components

1. **Data Acquisition and Processing Subsystem**
    - **Data Collectors:** Interfaces for collecting real-time data from various sensors and external sources.
    - **Data Pipeline:** Processes raw data to be suitable for further analysis (filtering, normalization, etc.).

2. **Recursive Learning Engine**
    - **Core Algorithm:** Utilize deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to allow the system to learn from its environment iteratively.
    - **Meta-Learning Layer:** Implement a meta-learning framework that enables the system to learn how to learn, optimizing its learning algorithms over time.
    - **Recursive Feedback Loop:** Continuously feeds learning outcomes back into the system to improve future decision-making.

3. **Decision Making and Planning Module**
    - **Predictive Analytics:** Leverages the learning engine to predict outcomes and plan actions.
    - **Adaptive Strategy Formulation:** Adjusts strategies dynamically based on predictions and evolving objectives.

4. **Safety and Compliance Layer**
    - **Rule-Based Constraints:** Ensures that all actions abide by safety and legal constraints.
    - **Ethical Reasoning Engine:** Includes mechanisms to integrate ethical considerations into the decision-making process.

5. **Monitoring and Evaluation System**
    - **Performance Metrics:** Continuously evaluates the performance and efficiency of learning algorithms.
    - **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies and flags any deviations or abnormalities in the system's functioning.

6. **Self-Diagnostic and Repair Unit**
    - **Health Monitoring Tools:** Assesses the system's operational status and detects faults.
    - **Auto-Repair Mechanisms:** Initiates self-correcting procedures whenever a fault is detected.

#### Recursive Strategies

- **Continuous Recursive Improvement:** The module continuously evaluates its performance and uses recursive strategies to refine and enhance its algorithms. This feedback loop allows the system to mature over time without human intervention.
  
- **Hierarchical Learning:** Employ a hierarchy of models where top-level models make abstract decisions and lower-level models focus on specific tasks, utilizing a recursive learning strategy to share insights across levels.

- **Self-Optimization:** Uses evolutionary algorithms to dynamically select the best-performing models and discard or alter less efficient ones.

- **Automated Testing and Experimentation:** Incorporate a test-bed environment where the system can experiment with new strategies and learn from failures in a controlled setup before deployment.

#### Implementation Sketch

```python
class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_pipeline = DataPipeline()
        self.learning_engine = RecursiveLearningEngine()
        self.decision_maker = DecisionMakingModule()
        self.safety_layer = SafetyComplianceLayer()
        self.monitoring_system = MonitoringSystem()
        self.diagnostic_unit = SelfDiagnosticUnit()

    def execute(self):
        while True:
            data = self.data_pipeline.collect_data()
            processed_data = self.data_pipeline.process_data(data)
            
            learning_outcome = self.learning_engine.learn(processed_data)
            decision = self.decision_maker.plan(learning_outcome)
            
            if self.safety_layer.is_safe(decision):
                self.perform_action(decision)
            
            self.monitoring_system.evaluate()
            self.diagnostic_unit.check_health()

    def perform_action(self, decision):
        # Implementation for performing the action goes here
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    autonomy_stack = AutonomyStack()
    autonomy_stack.execute()
```

### Conclusion

This module provides an innovative design framework focusing on self-evolution and adaptation, leveraging recursive learning strategies to ensure the PTM empire's autonomy stack remains cutting-edge. It integrates data-driven learning with ethical decision-making and robust monitoring to enable autonomous, continuous improvement.
