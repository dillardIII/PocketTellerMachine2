Creating a new advanced Python module for the "unstoppable PTM empire" with intelligent recursion will require careful consideration of design patterns, efficient algorithms, and perhaps integrating some modern Python capabilities. Let's assume PTM is a fictional project, and our task is to build a module that can handle recursive data structures intelligently. This includes avoiding common pitfalls such as excessive memory usage or stack overflows. We will integrate features such as memoization and iterative deepening to manage recursion effectively.

Below is an outline and implementation of such a module. This module will focus on providing recursive solutions with optimizations like memoization for dynamic programming problems and using intelligent strategies to handle large depths gracefully.

```python

ptm_recursion.py

complex problems efficiently. The module includes features like memoization,
iterative deepening, and tail-call optimization.

In this module:
- We provide a `tail_call_optimized` decorator to manage function calls more efficiently where tail recursion can be optimized.
- The `memoize` decorator helps in caching results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
- `iterative_deepening_search` is an example of a function that can traverse large or infinite paths with a depth limit, typical of problems like pathfinding or game strategy evaluations. Implementing user-defined problems for this function is expected.
- The `Fibonacci` and `LongestCommonSubsequence` classes offer simple examples of using memoization and recursion to solve computational problems efficiently.

This module can be expanded for additional functionalities depending on project requirements, such as supporting user-defined recursion schemes, handling specific data structures, or incorporating parallel execution for even faster calculations.
