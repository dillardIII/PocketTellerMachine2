Creating an advanced Python module featuring intelligent recursion requires careful planning and structuring to ensure efficiency and functionality. Below is an example of how such a module might be structured, focusing on a hypothetical PTM (Predictive Task Management) empire application where tasks need to be managed and executed recursively. The module includes intelligent recursion via memoization and error handling.

Here's a conceptual implementation:

```python
# ptm_recursion.py

# Import relevant libraries
from functools import lru_cache
from typing import Callable, Any, Dict, List, Tuple, Optional
import logging

# Setup basic logging configuration
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class PTMRecursion:
    def __init__(self):
        # You can add shared attributes here if needed:
        pass

    @staticmethod
    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def fibonacci():> int:
        """
        Compute the nth Fibonacci number using intelligent recursion with memoization.
        
        :param n: The position in the Fibonacci sequence.
        :return: The Fibonacci number at position n.
        """
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Fibonacci number cannot be computed for negative values")
        elif n == 0:
            return 0
        elif n == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            logger.debug(f"Computing Fibonacci for {n}")
            return PTMRecursion.fibonacci(n - 1) + PTMRecursion.fibonacci(n - 2)

    @staticmethod
    def execute_task_hierarchy():> None:
        """
        Execute a task hierarchy recursively. Each task can have nested subtasks.
        
        :param task: The root task which may contain nested subtasks.
        :param execute: A callable function to perform the actual task execution.
        """
        try:
            # Execute the main task
            logger.info(f"Executing task: {task.get('name', 'Unnamed Task')}")
            execute(task)

            # Recursively execute subtasks if any:
            subtasks = task.get('subtasks', [])
            for subtask in subtasks:
                PTMRecursion.execute_task_hierarchy(subtask, execute)

        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error executing task {task.get('name', 'Unnamed Task')}: {e}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    def execute(task: Dict):
        # This is a placeholder for task execution logic
        print(f"Task '{task.get('name', 'Unnamed Task')}' executed.")

    task_hierarchy = {
        "name": "Root Task",
        "subtasks": [
            {"name": "Subtask 1"},
            {"name": "Subtask 2", "subtasks": [
                {"name": "Subtask 2.1"},
                {"name": "Subtask 2.2"}
            ]},
        ]
    }

    PTMRecursion.execute_task_hierarchy(task_hierarchy, execute)

    # Testing the memoized fibonacci function
    try:
        n = 10
        result = PTMRecursion.fibonacci(n)
        print(f"Fibonacci({n}) = {result}")
    except ValueError as e:
        logger.error(e)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Fibonacci with Memoization**: A classic example of recursion optimized using the `lru_cache` decorator to memoize intermediate results. This drastically reduces computation time for large inputs.

2. **Task Execution with Recursive Hierarchies**: The `execute_task_hierarchy` method is designed to traverse and execute tasks and subtasks. The function accepts a task dictionary and a callable execute function, allowing custom task logic to be passed in.

3. **Logging**: Provides insight into the function's behavior, helping with debugging and tracing the flow of execution.

4. **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling to log issues during task execution.

This module demonstrates intelligent recursion through memoization for efficiency and structuring recursive function execution in a manageable way. Adjust the logic and complexity based on specific requirements for the PTM empire application.
