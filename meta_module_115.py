Creating a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "Persistent Turing Machine") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack can be a complex yet exciting task. This module aims to incorporate recursive strategies to enhance autonomy by allowing the system to adapt, learn, and self-improve continuously.

Here’s a high-level design for such a module called `ptm_autonomy`. This module will focus on key features like self-monitoring, recursive learning, and adaptive problem-solving.

### Module Design: ptm_autonomy

#### Core Components

1. **Self-Monitoring System**: Keeps track of the system’s performance and operational health.
   
2. **Recursive Learning Algorithm**: Continuously learns and adapts based on past performance and external feedback.

3. **Adaptive Problem Solver**: Dynamically adjusts strategies to solve problems based on the current environment and past experiences.

4. **Simulation Environment**: Tests and validates new strategies before deployment.

5. **Meta-Optimizer**: Adjusts the learning parameters and model architectures for efficiency.

#### Proposed Implementation

Below is a simplified approach to how you might begin to implement this module:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import random

# ===============================
# Self-Monitoring System
# ===============================
class SelfMonitoring:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_log = []

    def log_performance(self, data):
        print("Logging performance data...")
        self.performance_log.append(data)

    def evaluate_system_health(self):
        print("Evaluating system health...")
        # Simple heuristic: Check averages
        return np.mean(self.performance_log[-10:]) if self.performance_log else 1.0:
:
# ===============================
# Recursive Learning Algorithm
# ===============================
class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_base = {}
    
    def learn(self, input_data):
        print("Learning recursively...")
        # Recursive learning logic (e.g. update knowledge_base)
        key = hash(str(input_data))
        self.knowledge_base[key] = self.knowledge_base.get(key, 0) + 1

    def predict(self, input_data):
        print("Predicting outcome based on recursive learning...")
        key = hash(str(input_data))
        return self.knowledge_base.get(key, 0.5)  # return default if unlearned:
:
# ===============================
# Adaptive Problem Solver
# ===============================
class ProblemSolver:
    def __init__(self, learning_algorithm):
        self.learning_algorithm = learning_algorithm

    def solve(self, problem):
        print("Solving problem with adaptive strategies...")
        if random.random() < 0.5:
            return "Strategy A"
        else:
            return "Strategy B"

# ===============================
# Meta-Optimizer
# ===============================
class MetaOptimizer:
    def optimize(self):
        print("Optimizing learning parameters...")
        # Analyze learning performance and parameters.

# ===============================
# Simulation Environment
# ===============================
class SimulationEnvironment:
    def run_simulation(self, strategies):
        print("Running simulations...")
        # Evaluate strategies within a simulated environment

# ===============================
# PTM Autonomy Module
# ===============================
class PTMAutonomy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.monitor = SelfMonitoring()
        self.learner = RecursiveLearner()
        self.solver = ProblemSolver(self.learner)
        self.optimizer = MetaOptimizer()
        self.simulator = SimulationEnvironment()
    
    def run(self):
        # Loop over an operational cycle
        data = {}  # This would be operational data
        self.monitor.evaluate_system_health()
        self.learner.learn(data)
        decision = self.solver.solve(data)
        self.simulator.run_simulation([decision])
        self.monitor.log_performance(random.random())
        self.optimizer.optimize()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    autonomy_system = PTMAutonomy()
    for _ in range(10):
        autonomy_system.run()
```

### Innovative Recursive Strategies
- **Nested Learning Loops**: Enable the system to apply sub-learning tasks that learn optimal steps in context, driving deeper insights and more accurate decisions.
  
- **Feedback Adaptation**: Use performance data to recursively adjust learning rates and strategy priorities.

- **Cross-Domain Transfer Learning**: Implement transfers of learning strategies across distinct domains to enhance adaptability.

This implementation hinges on key AI and machine learning principles, allowing the PTM empire to function with a self-evolving autonomous stack. Continuous iteration and incorporation of advanced AI models (e.g., deep learning, reinforcement learning) can further enhance this framework.
