Certainly! Creating an extremely aggressive and creative Python-based trading system requires a blend of advanced machine learning, algorithmic trading, autonomous decision-making, and continuous system evolution. Here's a conceptual architecture and strategy outline:

### Project Zephyr: Autonomous Trading System

#### Core Components
1. **Data Ingestion & Processing:**
   - Integrate multifaceted data sources: real-time market data, news feeds, alternative data (social media sentiment, satellite imagery analysis).
   - Use Kafka or Apache Pulsar for high-throughput data streaming.
   - Utilize Hadoop or Spark for large-scale data processing.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Implement deep feature synthesis using libraries like Featuretools for automated feature extraction.
   - Use Google BigQuery ML to augment data feature sets with macroscopic economic signals and patterns.

3. **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Engine:**
   - Construct an RL framework using OpenAI's Gym or RLlib.
   - Utilize a combination of DDPG, PPO, and SAC algorithms to explore optimal trading policies.
   - Train agents in a simulated trading environment with virtual capital and historical data.

4. **Deep Learning Models:**
   - Deploy Transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT) to interpret qualitative content like earnings calls and news articles.
   - Implement LSTM and CNN networks for time series prediction.
   - Combine model ensembles to improve prediction accuracy via stacking and boosting techniques.

5. **Autonomous Evolution:**
   - Develop Genetic Algorithms for hyperparameter optimization.
   - Implement evolutionary strategies for model selection and architecture decisions.
   - Use Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to autonomously evolve deep learning model structures.

6. **Risk Management System:**
   - Programmatically define risk boundaries using CVaR and other tail-risk models.
   - Design AI-driven stop-loss and position-sizing algorithms.
   - Implement adversarial learning to test and improve system robustness against market anomalies.

7. **Execution & Trade Automation:**
   - Integrate with broker APIs using FAST, FIX, or REST protocols for seamless order execution.
   - Design low-latency trading strategies featuring techniques from HFT (High-Frequency Trading).
   - Optimize order routing using ML algorithms to minimize slippage and transaction costs.

#### Deployment & Monitoring
1. **Cloud-Native Infrastructure:**
   - Deploy on Kubernetes clusters for scalability and resilience.
   - Utilize Docker containers for microservices flexibility.
   - Leverage Spot Instances on AWS or Google Cloud for cost-efficient computational power.

2. **Monitoring & Feedback Loops:**
   - Implement real-time logging and monitoring with ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and Grafana.
   - Build feedback loops to retrain models based on performance.
   - Use Anomaly Detection algorithms to identify system failings or market shifts.

3. **Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD):**
   - Automate testing with Pytest and integration with Jenkins for rapid deployment.
   - Adopt Blue-Green Deployment strategies to minimize downtime and risk.

4. **Ethical Compliance & Regulation:**
   - Incorporate sentiment analysis to halt trading when detecting negative sentiment spikes.
   - Implement audit trails for compliance with financial regulations (e.g., MiFID II, FINRA).

### Conclusion
This aggressive and creative trading strategy leverages cutting-edge technologies in autonomous system design. It promises sophistication through the use of AI, continuous adaptation via evolutionary algorithms, and resilience through robust risk management and cloud infrastructure, all contributing to a truly powerful financial empire-building tool.
