Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional entity, let's assume it stands for "Personalized Transportation Machine") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a careful approach. We'll focus on implementing recursive strategies that enable more advanced autonomy and adaptability. Here's a high-level design outline and sample code for a module named `ptm_autonomy`.

### Module Objectives:
1. **Self-Learning and Adaptation:** Utilize machine learning to allow the system to evolve based on past experiences and interactions.
2. **Recursive Strategy Implementation:** Introduce mechanisms for recursive decision-making, enabling more intelligent behavior and self-improvement over time.
3. **Simulation and Real-World Integration:** Ensure the module can operate in both simulated environments for safe testing and real-world applications for practical use.
4. **Modular Design:** Facilitate ease of expansion and integration with other subsystems in the PTM empire.

### Key Components:
1. **Self-Evolving Base Class:** This class will serve as a foundation for building recursive strategies.
2. **Recursive Decision Engine:** A sub-system that uses recursion to refine decision pathways.
3. **Environment Simulator:** To train autonomy algorithms in a controlled setting.
4. **Feedback Loop Mechanism:** To continually integrate new data and learn from past decisions.

### Sample Code Structure

Hereâ€™s a simplified version of what the module might look like:

```python
# ptm_autonomy/__init__.py

class SelfEvolvingBase:
    """Base class for components with self-evolving capabilities."""
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []
    
    def learn_from_experience(self, new_data):
        """Integrate new data into the system's knowledge base."""
        self.history.append(new_data)
        self._update_model()
    
    def _update_model(self):
        """Internal method to update the model based on history."""
        raise NotImplementedError("This method should be implemented by subclasses.")

class RecursiveDecisionEngine(SelfEvolvingBase):
    """Engine for recursive decision-making processes."""
    
    def make_decision(self, state):
        """Make a decision based on current state using recursive strategies."""
        return self._recursive_strategy(state, depth=3)
    
    def _recursive_strategy(self, state, depth):
        """Recursive strategy to evaluate the best decision pathway."""
        if depth <= 0 or self._is_terminal(state):
            return self._evaluate_state(state)
        
        best_score = float('-inf')
        best_action = None
        for action in self._get_available_actions(state):
            new_state = self._simulate_action(state, action)
            score = self._recursive_strategy(new_state, depth - 1)
            if score > best_score:
                best_score = score
                best_action = action
        return best_action
    
    def _is_terminal(self, state):
        """Check if the state is a terminal state."""
        # Implement terminal state logic
        return False

    def _get_available_actions(self, state):
        """Return available actions for a given state."""
        # Implement action retrieval logic
        return []

    def _simulate_action(self, state, action):
        """Simulate an action and return the new state."""
        # Implement action simulation logic
        return state

    def _evaluate_state(self, state):
        """Evaluate the quality of a state."""
        # Implement state evaluation logic
        return 0

class EnvironmentSimulator:
    """Simulate environments for safe training and testing."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_environment = None
    
    def load_environment(self, env_config):
        """Load and set up a new environment."""
        # Implement environment setup
        self.current_environment = env_config
    
    def run_simulation(self, decision_engine):
        """Run a simulation using the given decision engine."""
        state = self.current_environment.get_initial_state()
        while not decision_engine._is_terminal(state):
            action = decision_engine.make_decision(state)
            state = decision_engine._simulate_action(state, action)
            # Implement continuous feedback loop
            decision_engine.learn_from_experience(state)

# Example Usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    decision_engine = RecursiveDecisionEngine()
    simulator = EnvironmentSimulator()
    simulator.load_environment(env_config="sample_env")
    simulator.run_simulation(decision_engine)
```

### Explanation:
- **SelfEvolvingBase:** A foundational class with a history to store past data for recursive learning. Subclasses will implement specific models and learning mechanisms.
- **RecursiveDecisionEngine:** Contains a recursive strategy for decision-making, allowing the system to evaluate multiple potential pathways and choose the best action.
- **EnvironmentSimulator:** Provides a framework for running simulations, allowing the decision engine to learn and adapt through trial and error.

### Further Expansion:
1. **Incorporate Machine Learning Models:** Extend `_update_model` to retrain based on historical data.
2. **Enhance Recursive Logic:** Improve the recursive strategy function to better mimic complex decision-making pathways.
3. **Integrate Reinforcement Learning:** Use techniques such as Q-learning to enhance adaptive learning.
4. **Build Real-World Interfaces:** Develop interfaces to real-world sensory inputs and actuators for practical deployment.

This module is an initial blueprint and would require further details and refinements, particularly in terms of implementation specifics for action simulation, state evaluation, and environmental setup.
