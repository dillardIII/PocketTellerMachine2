Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (let’s assume it stands for "Predictive Task Management") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies is a complex task. This module should focus on advanced AI and ML techniques, allowing components to learn, adapt, and optimize autonomously through recursive processes. Let's outline the structure and some potential features of this module:

### Module: self_evolve

#### Purpose:
To implement recursive strategies that enable components to self-optimize and evolve based on historical performance data, real-time feedback, and predictive analysis. The goal is to create a self-sustaining autonomous system that improves over time without direct human intervention.

#### Key Components:
1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**
    - Collects and prepares data for analysis and decision-making. 
    - Manages real-time data streams and batch data inputs.
    
2. **Recursive Learning Engine**
    - Implements machine learning models that can recursively update themselves.
    - Supports online learning techniques to adapt models in real-time.
    - Example technologies: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks), Reinforcement Learning.

3. **Autonomous Decision-Making**
    - Uses predictive analytics to forecast future states and outcomes.
    - Employs recursive decision-making processes to evaluate options and choose optimal actions.
    
4. **Performance Monitoring & Feedback Loop**
    - Continuously monitors system performance.
    - Implements feedback loops that allow the system to learn from past decisions and outcomes.
    
5. **Self-Optimization Mechanism**
    - Applies optimization algorithms to improve system efficiency.
    - Supports genetic algorithms or simulated annealing for recursive tuning of performance parameters.
    
6. **Adaptive Strategy Generator**
    - Crafts new strategies based on environmental changes or evolving data patterns.
    - Uses generative models to propose novel solutions and approaches.

#### Core Recursive Strategy: 

This module relies on the recursive application of learning and decision-making processes. For illustration, the recursive learning engine could operate as follows:

- **Recursive Learning Loop:**
  - **Initialize**: Start with an initial model trained on historical data.
  - **Observe**: Continuously gather input data from external sensors and internal logs.
  - **Adapt**: Adjust the model parameters based on new data, using methods such as online gradient descent.
  - **Predict**: Generate predictions based on the updated model, feeding into the decision-making component.
  - **Decide**: Make optimal decisions using updated predictions and a comprehensive decision tree.
  - **Feedback**: Gather results of decisions, evaluate the outcome, and feed back into learning loop for further optimization.

```python
# Example skeleton of the module
class SelfEvolve:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = self.initialize_model()
        self.data_acquisition = DataAcquisition()
        self.feedback_loop = FeedbackLoop()

    def initialize_model(self):
        # Initialize a preliminary machine learning model
        pass

    def recursive_learning_engine(self, input_data):
        # Recursive update of model parameters
        pass

    def autonomous_decision_making(self, predictions):
        # Make decisions based on model predictions
        pass

    def self_optimize(self):
        # Run optimization to tune model
        pass

    def run(self):
        # Main loop to engage recursive strategies
        while True:
            data = self.data_acquisition.get_data()
            predictions = self.recursive_learning_engine(data)
            self.autonomous_decision_making(predictions)
            self.self_optimize()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    autonomy_system = SelfEvolve()
    autonomy_system.run()
```

### Key Considerations:
- **Scalability**: The system should handle an increasing load without performance degradation.
- **Robustness**: Mechanisms for error detection, correction, and system recovery should be integral.
- **Security**: Protect against potential cyber threats through reliable encryption and authentication strategies.
- **Ethics**: Ensure compliance with ethical AI standards, promoting transparency and fairness.

This module is built to grow and improve autonomously, harnessing innovative recursive strategies to drive efficiency and effectiveness across the PTM empire’s autonomy systems.
