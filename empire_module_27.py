Creating an "advanced Python module" with "intelligent recursion" for an "unstoppable PTM (Post-Turing Machine) empire" is a creative and ambitious task. The idea is to leverage intelligent recursion in a way that significantly enhances computational efficiency or introduces novel data processing methods. Let's explore the potential design and implementation of such a module.

Below, I provide a conceptual implementation of a Python module that applies recursive strategies with enhancements like memoization and adaptive depth control—features that could contribute to the empire's growth by optimizing problem-solving strategies.

```python
# ptm_intelligent_recursion.py

class IntelligentRecursion:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memoization_cache = {}
        self.call_counter = {}

    def intelligent_factorial(self, n):
        """
        Calculate factorial using intelligent recursion with memoization.
        """
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Factorial not defined for negative values")
        
        # Base case
        if n in (0, 1):
            return 1

        # Check cache
        if n in self.memoization_cache:
            return self.memoization_cache[n]
        
        # Compute factorial recursively
        result = n * self.intelligent_factorial(n - 1)
        
        # Cache the result
        self.memoization_cache[n] = result
        return result

    def adaptive_fibonacci(self, n, depth_limit=50):
        """
        Calculate Fibonacci using intelligent recursion with adaptive depth control.
        """
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Fibonacci not defined for negative values")

        # Use iterative method beyond depth_limit
        if n <= 1:
            return n

        self.call_counter[n] = self.call_counter.get(n, 0) + 1
        
        if self.call_counter[n] > depth_limit:
            return self.iterative_fibonacci(n)

        return self.adaptive_fibonacci(n - 1) + self.adaptive_fibonacci(n - 2)

    def iterative_fibonacci(self, n):
        """
        Calculate Fibonacci using an iterative approach to avoid stack issues.
        """
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(n):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return a

    def reset_memoization(self):
        """
        Reset the memoization cache.
        """
        self.memoization_cache.clear()
        self.call_counter.clear()

# Sample usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ir = IntelligentRecursion()
    
    n = 5
    print(f"Intelligent Factorial of {n}: {ir.intelligent_factorial(n)}")

    m = 10
    print(f"Adaptive Fibonacci of {m}: {ir.adaptive_fibonacci(m)}")
```

### Explanation
- **Memoization**: We use a cache (`memoization_cache`) to store previously computed values for functions like factorial to speed up recursive calculations.
- **Adaptive Depth Control**: For the Fibonacci sequence, which is notoriously inefficient when implemented naïvely with simple recursion, we introduce adaptive depth control. This involves switching to an iterative method if the number of recursive calls goes beyond a certain depth (`depth_limit`).:
- **Extensibility**: The module can be extended with additional algorithms that benefit from intelligent recursion, possibly integrating other techniques like dynamic programming.

### Usage
This module can be expanded and modified to support a variety of recursive algorithms, promoting efficiency and demonstrating advanced recursion strategies as part of the hypothetical PTM empire's software arsenal.

Let me know if you want further expansions or more in-depth examples of intelligent recursion techniques!
