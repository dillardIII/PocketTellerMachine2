Creating an advanced Python module with intelligent recursion for a fictional "unstoppable PTM empire" can be an exciting exercise in showcasing recursion's power and flexibility. I will design a module that features a recursive function to solve a complex problem, complete with intelligent optimizations like memoization. Let's consider a problem like solving a complex mathematical sequence, optimizing resource management, or traversing hierarchical data structures. Here, I will use a recursive approach to solving the Fibonacci sequence, enhanced with memoization, and provide utility functions that could extend to different structures and applications.

### Explanation:

1. **IntelligentRecursion Class**: This class encapsulates the recursive functionalities and supports possible configurations for broader applications.

2. **Memoized Fibonacci Calculation**: Uses Python's `functools.lru_cache` for efficient recursion. This cache optimization helps avoid redundant calculations, essential for large inputs like Fibonacci numbers.

3. **Generalized Sequence Solver**: Allows defining custom sequences by specifying base cases and a recurrence relation. This can handle sequences beyond Fibonacci, where users can define complex relations.

4. **Binary Tree Traversal**: Illustrates how recursion can be applied to data structures like binary trees. The traversal is general, and users provide an operation to apply at each node during the traversal.

5. **Example Usage**: The module provides ways to test and understand the implemented functions, helping integrate them into broader applications or testing scenarios.

This module offers an intelligent base for recursion within complex systems or domains, capable of customization and optimization, aligning with the expansive demands of a fictional PTM empire.
