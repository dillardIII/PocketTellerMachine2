Designing a Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably a fictional or hypothetical organization) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can enhance its operations, decision-making, and adaptability through recursive strategies. Here's a conceptual breakdown of such a module:

### Module: `AutonomyExpansion`

#### Key Components

1. **Knowledge Graph Manager (`knowledge_graph.py`):**
   - Build and manage a dynamic knowledge graph representing the PTM's knowledge base.
   - Recursive updates from both internal activities and external data sources.
   - Interfaces for querying, updating, and evolving knowledge structures.

2. **Self-Learning AI Agents (`self_learning_agents.py`):**
   - Incorporate self-evolving, distributed AI agents.
   - Implement continuous learning through internal feedback loops and environment interactions.
   - Recursive improvement strategies using reinforcement learning algorithms.

3. **Decision Support System (`decision_support.py`):**
   - Advanced decision-making capabilities leveraging the knowledge graph and AI agent outputs.
   - Recursive simulation models to forecast potential outcomes and optimize decisions.
   - Integration of game theory for strategic decision-making in competitive environments.

4. **Autonomous Process Integrator (`process_integrator.py`):**
   - Seamless integration of autonomous processes into existing workflows.
   - Recursive optimization of operational processes using data-driven insights.
   - Interfaces for process monitoring, adaptation, and scaling.

5. **Evolving Security Framework (`security_framework.py`):**
   - Proactively identify and mitigate security threats using recursive threat modeling.
   - Adaptive security mechanisms that evolve alongside potential vulnerabilities.
   - Continuous feedback loops for security performance enhancement.

6. **Communication and Collaboration Hub (`communication_hub.py`):**
   - Facilitate seamless communication between different autonomy modules.
   - Recursive improvement of communication protocols for efficient information dissemination.
   - Collaboration interfaces for human-autonomy interaction.

#### Innovative Recursive Strategies

- **Recursive Data Refinement:**
  - Continuously refine input data using recursive algorithms to improve accuracy and relevance.
  - Use machine learning to self-identify areas for data enhancement.

- **Recursive Capability Expansion:**
  - Dynamically expand system capabilities through recursive identification of missing features or inefficiencies.
  - Implement a feedback-driven development process.

- **Adaptive Evolution:**
  - Employ evolutionary algorithms to recursively adapt strategies and operations.
  - Allow the system to simulate and experiment with multiple evolutionary paths for robust autonomy development.

#### Implementation Example

Below is a basic structure for the `knowledge_graph.py` component:

```python
# knowledge_graph.py

class KnowledgeGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = {}
        
    def add_entity(self, entity_id, attributes):
        """Adds an entity with attributes to the graph."""
        self.graph[entity_id] = attributes

    def get_entity(self, entity_id):
        """Retrieves entity attributes."""
        return self.graph.get(entity_id, None)

    def update_entity(self, entity_id, new_attributes):
        """Recursively update entity information."""
        if entity_id in self.graph:
            self.graph[entity_id].update(new_attributes)

    def recursive_update_from_external_data(self, external_data_func):
        """Recursively update graph using data from an external source."""
        updated_data = external_data_func()
        for entity_id, attributes in updated_data.items():
            if entity_id in self.graph:
                self.update_entity(entity_id, attributes)

    def query_graph(self, query):
        """Query the graph to find specific patterns or entities."""
        # Implement query logic
        pass
```

### Future Expansion

- Integrate advanced neuro-symbolic AI for enhanced reasoning capabilities.
- Incorporate blockchain technology for data integrity and auditability.
- Explore quantum computing techniques for complex optimization tasks.

Each of these components and strategies will need to be refined and expanded upon based on the specific needs, goals, and technological capabilities of the PTM empire's autonomy stack.
