Creating an advanced Python module for the "unstoppable PTM empire" that implements intelligent recursion involves several key considerations. We'll design a module that uses recursive techniques to solve complex problems, such as traversing data structures or solving algorithmic challenges like the Fibonacci sequence, Pascal's triangle, or finding paths in a maze. Intelligent recursion often involves optimizing the recursive calls to avoid excessive resource consumption through techniques like memoization.

Below is a conceptual example of a module that features intelligent recursion with memoization to efficiently compute the nth Fibonacci number, and more complex operations like pathfinding with recursion in a grid (e.g., a maze).

```python
# Filename: ptm_empire_tools.py

class IntelligentRecursion:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize a dictionary for memoization to store already computed values
        self.memo = {}
        self.maze_paths_cache = {}

    def fibonacci(self, n):
        """Compute the nth Fibonacci number using intelligent recursion with memoization."""
        if n <= 1:
            return n

        if n not in self.memo:
            # Store the result in the memo dictionary to use it in future calls
            self.memo[n] = self.fibonacci(n-1) + self.fibonacci(n-2)

        return self.memo[n]

    def find_paths_in_maze(self, grid):
        """Find all possible paths in a maze from top-left to bottom-right using intelligent recursion."""
        self.paths = []
        self.maze_paths(grid, 0, 0, [])
        return self.paths

    def maze_paths(self, grid, x, y, path):
        if not self.is_valid(grid, x, y):
            return
        
        # Add current position to the path
        path.append((x, y))

        # If we've reached the bottom-right corner, add the path to paths list
        if (x, y) == (len(grid) - 1, len(grid[0]) - 1):
            self.paths.append(path.copy())
        else:
            self.maze_paths(grid, x + 1, y, path)  # Move Down
            self.maze_paths(grid, x, y + 1, path)  # Move Right

        # Backtracking
        path.pop()

    def is_valid(self, grid, x, y):
        """Check if the current position is within grid bounds and not an obstacle.""":
        if (x, y) in self.maze_paths_cache:
            return self.maze_paths_cache[(x, y)]

        valid = (
            0 <= x < len(grid) and
            0 <= y < len(grid[0]) and
            grid[x][y] != 1  # Assuming 1 represents an obstacle
        )
        self.maze_paths_cache[(x, y)] = valid
        return valid


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ir = IntelligentRecursion()
    fib_result = ir.fibonacci(10)
    print("Fibonacci(10):", fib_result)  # Output: Fibonacci(10): 55

    maze = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 1],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0]
    ]
    paths = ir.find_paths_in_maze(maze)
    print("Paths in maze:", paths)

    # Outputs something like:
    # Paths in maze: [[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0)]]
```

### Key Features:
- **Memoization**: The module effectively uses memoization to store precomputed results of Fibonacci numbers and the validity of maze grid positions.
- **Pathfinding in a Maze**: It uses recursion to find all possible paths from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of a maze grid, with backtracking to explore different paths.
- **Code Efficiency**: By avoiding recomputation with memoization, the recursive functions run more efficiently, lending the module an "intelligent" aspect.

This module can be extended with more functions and adaptations to suit the needs of an "unstoppable PTM empire." It illustrates a balance between intelligent problem-solving and computational efficiency.
