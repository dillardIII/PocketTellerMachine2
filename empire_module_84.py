Creating an advanced Python module for an "unstoppable PTM (Presumably Predictive Text Model) empire" with intelligent recursion could involve designing a system that leverages recursive algorithms to enhance text prediction capabilities. Hereâ€™s an outline of how such a module might look, with Python code illustrating key concepts:

```python
# ptm_module.py

import random
from collections import defaultdict

class PredictiveTextModel:
    def __init__(self, depth=3):
        self.depth = depth
        self.model = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
        self.context = []

    def train(self, text):
        """
        Train the model with the provided text.
        Break text into words and update the prediction model.
        """
        words = text.split()
        for i in range(len(words) - self.depth):
            context_tuple = tuple(words[i:i+self.depth])
            next_word = words[i + self.depth]
            self.model[context_tuple][next_word] += 1

    def predict(self, text, num_predictions=1):
        """
        Predict the next words based on the input text.
        Uses intelligent recursion to explore multiple prediction paths.
        """
        context = tuple(text.split()[-self.depth:])
        return self._recursive_predict(context, num_predictions)

    def _recursive_predict(self, context, num_predictions):
        if num_predictions == 0:
            return []

        next_word = self._predict_next_word(context)
        new_context = context[1:] + (next_word,)
        
        prediction = [next_word] + self._recursive_predict(new_context, num_predictions - 1)
        
        return prediction

    def _predict_next_word(self, context):
        """
        Predicts the next word based on the current context.
        Uses weighted probabilities from the trained model.
        """
        candidates = self.model[context]
        total = sum(candidates.values())
        if total == 0:
            return random.choice(list(self.model.keys()))[0]  # Fallback to random choice

        r = random.randint(1, total)
        cumulative = 0
        for word, count in candidates.items():
            cumulative += count
            if cumulative >= r:
                return word

    def print_model(self):
        for context, next_words in self.model.items():
            print(f"Context: {context}, Next words: {next_words}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ptm = PredictiveTextModel(depth=2)
    ptm.train("the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog the quick fox")
    print("Model Trained!")
    
    # Make predictions
    starting_text = "the quick"
    predictions = ptm.predict(starting_text, num_predictions=10)
    print(f"Starting with '{starting_text}', predicted sequence: {' '.join(predictions)}")
    # Print the internal model for debugging
    ptm.print_model()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Data Model**: The `PredictiveTextModel` uses a `defaultdict` to handle the word prediction frequencies tied to particular contexts, which are tuples of words of length `depth`.

2. **Training**: The `train` method processes text data, updating the frequency counts of each possible "next word" for any given context of `depth` words.

3. **Prediction**: The `predict` method uses intelligent recursion via the `_recursive_predict` method.
   - It constructs predictions based on the frequency of words that follow the current context in the training data.
   - This process is recursive, producing a sequence of predictions.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: Around word prediction, the model uses random selection in case the context hasn't been seen before, preventing failures.

5. **Print Model**: A debugging function is provided to inspect the internally-trained model, which is useful for understanding how the model has weighted different possible next words. 

This is a foundational approach to using a simple Markov chain-like recursive structure for predictive text modeling. In a real-world scenario, advanced models might include elements such as machine learning or deeper natural language processing techniques.
