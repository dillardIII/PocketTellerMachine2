Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a theoretical or fictional organization) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a strategic approach that focuses on flexibility, scalability, and the ability to self-optimize through recursive strategies. Here's an outline for such a module:

### Module Name: `AdaptiveAutoStack`

#### Module Structure:

1. **Core Components:**
    - **Data Acquisition Layer**
    - **Adaptive Model Layer**
    - **Decision-Making Engine**
    - **Self-Optimization and Learning Engine**
    - **Communication Interface**

2. **Innovative Features:**
    - **Recursive Feedback Loops**
    - **Meta-Learning Algorithms**
    - **Dynamic Resource Allocation**
    - **Multi-Agent Collaboration**

#### Code Outline:

```python
# AdaptiveAutoStack module

import numpy as np
import random
from collections import defaultdict
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

class AdaptiveAutoStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_layer = DataAcquisitionLayer()
        self.model_layer = AdaptiveModelLayer()
        self.decision_engine = DecisionMakingEngine()
        self.optimization_engine = SelfOptimizationEngine()
        self.communication_interface = CommunicationInterface()

    def evolve(self):
        # Main loop for self-evolving mechanism
        while True:
            data = self.data_layer.collect_data()
            model_predictions = self.model_layer.update_model(data)
            decisions = self.decision_engine.make_decision(model_predictions)
            self.optimization_engine.optimize(decisions)
            self.communication_interface.communicate(decisions, model_predictions)

# Data Acquisition Layer
class DataAcquisitionLayer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sources = []

    def collect_data(self):
        # Simulate data collection
        data = [random.random() for _ in range(10)]
        return data

# Adaptive Model Layer
class AdaptiveModelLayer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(5,), max_iter=1000)

    def update_model(self, data):
        # Pretend we're training the model here
        X = np.array(data).reshape(-1, 1)
        y = np.array(data) # Fake target for illustration
        self.model.fit(X, y)
        return self.model.predict(X)

# Decision-Making Engine
class DecisionMakingEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def make_decision(self, predictions):
        # Implement decision-making strategy
        decisions = {}
        for idx, prediction in enumerate(predictions):
            decisions[idx] = "Action" if prediction > 0.5 else "No Action"
        return decisions

# Self-Optimization and Learning Engine
class SelfOptimizationEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_history = defaultdict(list)

    def optimize(self, decisions):
        # Simulate some optimization logic
        self.performance_history["decisions"].append(decisions)
        self._recursive_self_improvement()

    def _recursive_self_improvement(self):
        # Implement recursive strategy for self-improvement
        if len(self.performance_history["decisions"]) > 10: # Arbitrary condition
            print("Refining strategies...")

# Communication Interface
class CommunicationInterface:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def communicate(self, decisions, predictions):
        # Demonstrating communication
        print(f"Decisions: {decisions}, Predictions: {predictions}")

# Entry point
if __name__ == "__main__":
    stack = AdaptiveAutoStack()
    stack.evolve()
```

#### Key Aspects:

- **Recursive Feedback Loops:** The `SelfOptimizationEngine` uses past performance to iteratively improve decision-making strategies.
- **Meta-Learning Algorithms:** By creating a self-improvement loop, the module learns how to learn better over time, refining its models and strategies.
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Though not detailed in code, this could be implemented by dynamically tuning resources allocated to model training or decision-making based on system load and model performance.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** The communication interface can be extended to support interaction and collaboration between multiple autonomous agents.

This module aims to lay a foundation for future enhancements, including more advanced machine learning techniques, deeper integration of feedback mechanisms, and broader communication interfaces for multi-agent systems.
