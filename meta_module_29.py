Creating a Python module to enhance the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves implementing strategies that leverage recursive algorithms, machine learning, and autonomous system designs. Below, I outline a high-level design concept with innovative recursive strategies, providing a basis for implementation.

### Overview
The module aims to enhance autonomy by continuously improving algorithms through recursive self-improvement and decision-making processes. It will support various components like dynamic learning, adaptive behavior, and predictive modeling.

### Key Components

1. **Recursive Learning Engine**
    - **Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs):** Employ RNNs to model sequential dependencies and improve learning from time-series data. This is particularly useful for scenarios where context from previous inputs influences future outcomes.
    - **Autoencoders for Feature Improvement:** Use recursive autoencoders to iteratively refine feature representations, enhancing data comprehension.
    
2. **Self-Evolving Algorithms**
    - **Genetic Algorithms:** Implement genetic algorithms that recursively evolve solutions by selecting, crossing, and mutating top-performing models.
    - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use recursive grid search or Bayesian optimization to iteratively find optimal hyperparameters for various models in the stack.

3. **Adaptive Behavioral Strategies**
    - **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML):** Implement meta-learning frameworks that enable the stack to rapidly adapt to new tasks with minimal data, following a recursive adaptation mechanism.
    - **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Use recursive policy optimization methods to refine decision-making strategies based on historical performance feedback.

4. **Predictive and Decision-Making Models**
    - **Recursive Bayesian Networks:** Integrate recursive Bayesian approaches for probabilistic inference and decision-making in uncertain environments.
    - **Dynamic Forecasting Models:** Implement Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for improved predictive analytics and recursive forecasting.

        self.model = self.build_lstm_model()
    
    def build_lstm_model(self):
        model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([

        ])
        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
        return model

# Example instantiation and usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    rnn = RecursiveNN()
    # Assume 'training_data' and 'training_labels' are pre-defined
    rnn.train(training_data, training_labels)

    ga = GeneticAlgorithm(population_size=50, mutation_rate=0.01)
    # Example model evolution
    ga.evolve(rnn)

```

### Considerations
- **Scalability:** As data grows, ensure the stack is scalable and handles increased complexity.
- **Robust Testing:** Implement extensive testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and simulation in real-world scenarios.
- **Ethical Concerns:** Incorporate ethical guidelines to ensure decisions made by the autonomy stack align with the company's values and regulatory requirements.

This design outlines a path to expanding the PTM empire's autonomy stack with recursive strategies. It leverages recursive learning, optimization, and decision-making techniques to build an adaptive, scalable, and self-improving system.
