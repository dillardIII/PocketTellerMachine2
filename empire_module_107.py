Creating an advanced Python module with intelligent recursion for a fictional "unstoppable PTM empire" requires some context about what the module is supposed to achieve. Since this is quite open-ended, I'll assume we're developing a module that demonstrates intelligent recursion for a variety of algorithmic problems that might be relevant to complex systems or hierarchical tasks, which could be part of this "PTM empire."

The following Python module includes intelligent recursion techniques for tasks such as factorial computation, Fibonacci sequence calculation, and a more complex recursive system like solving mazes.

```python
# ptm_empire_module.py

import functools

# Intelligent recursion for factorial computation
@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def factorial(n):
    print(f"Calling factorial({n})")
    if n < 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Intelligent recursion for Fibonacci sequence computation
@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci(n):
    print(f"Calling fibonacci({n})")
    if n < 2:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

# Maze solving using recursion and backtracking
def solve_maze(maze, pos=(0, 0), path=[]):
    x, y = pos
    # Check if the current position is out of the bounds or a wall
    if x < 0 or x >= len(maze[0]) or y < 0 or y >= len(maze) or maze[y][x] == 1:
        return False

    # Check if the current position is the goal
    if maze[y][x] == 'G':
        path.append(pos)
        return True

    # Mark the position as visited by setting it to a wall
    maze[y][x] = 1
    path.append(pos)

    # Try to go right, down, left, and up
    if (solve_maze(maze, (x + 1, y), path) or 
        solve_maze(maze, (x, y + 1), path) or 
        solve_maze(maze, (x - 1, y), path) or 
        solve_maze(maze, (x, y - 1), path)):
        return path

    # Remove the position from the path and backtrack
    path.pop()
    return False

# Example maze (0 = path, 1 = wall, 'G' = goal)
example_maze = [
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 'G', 0]
]

# Witness the power of intelligent recursion
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Using our intelligent functions

    # Factorial example
    print("Factorial of 5: ", factorial(5))

    # Fibonacci example
    print("10th Fibonacci number: ", fibonacci(10))

    # Maze solving example
    path = []
    if solve_maze([row[:] for row in example_maze], path=path):
        print("Maze solution path: ", path)
    else:
        print("No solution found for the maze.")
```

### Key Features:

1. **Memoization with `functools.lru_cache`:** This is used for the recursive calls in the `factorial` and `fibonacci` functions to cache results and avoid redundant calculations, enhancing performance.

2. **Maze Solving with Backtracking:** The `solve_maze` function is a demonstration of using recursion for solving a maze. It uses backtracking to explore possible paths to the goal ('G') within the bounds of the maze.

3. **Logging Calls:** The module lightly logs function calls to show the trace of calculation, which can be helpful for debugging and understanding recursion flows.

This module can be extended to include more complex recursive algorithms and optimization techniques depending on the specific needs of the "PTM empire."
