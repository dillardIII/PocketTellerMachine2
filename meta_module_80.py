Designing a new Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably a company or system named PTM) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves several key components. Here's a high-level overview and sample outline of such a module:

### Module Name: PTM_Autonomy

#### Key Features:
1. **Self-Evolving Mechanism**: Implement a self-evolving capability that can learn and adapt over time.
2. **Recursive Strategies**: Use recursive algorithms to refine decision-making processes and improve system efficiency.
3. **Modularity and Scalability**: Design the system to be modular and scalable to accommodate future enhancements.
4. **Robust Data Processing**: Efficient handling and processing of large datasets for training and evolution.
5. **Secure and Fault-Tolerant**: Ensure robust security and fault tolerance to maintain system integrity.

#### Structure:

```python
# File: ptm_autonomy.py

import numpy as np
import logging
from typing import Callable, List, Optional

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class PTMSelfEvolvingSystem:
    def __init__(self, initial_state: np.array, learning_rate: float):
        self.state = initial_state
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate

    def evolve(self, data: np.array, iterations: int = 100):
        logging.info("Beginning evolution process.")
        for i in range(iterations):
            self.state = self.recursive_strategy(self.state, data)
            logging.debug(f"Iteration {i+1}/{iterations}, State: {self.state}")

    def recursive_strategy(self, state: np.array, data: np.array) -> np.array:
        # Example recursive strategy: Gradient Descent-like Optimization
        gradient = self.compute_gradient(state, data)
        logging.debug(f"Computed gradient: {gradient}")

        # Recursively apply updates to the state
        return self._recursive_update(state, gradient)
    
    def _recursive_update(self, state: np.array, gradient: np.array, steps: int = 5) -> np.array:
        if steps <= 0:
            return state

        updated_state = state - self.learning_rate * gradient
        logging.debug(f"Updated state at step {steps}: {updated_state}")

        return self._recursive_update(updated_state, self.compute_gradient(updated_state, gradient), steps - 1)

    def compute_gradient(self, state: np.array, data: np.array) -> np.array:
        # Dummy gradient computation
        return np.dot(data.T, (np.dot(data, state) - data))

# Using the module
def main():
    # Example usage
    initial_state = np.random.rand(10)
    data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    system = PTMSelfEvolvingSystem(initial_state, learning_rate=0.01)

    system.evolve(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Key Components:

1. **PTMSelfEvolvingSystem Class**:
   - Handles the main logic for the self-evolving system.
   - Stores the current state and a learning rate as parameters.
   - `evolve` function is the entry point for running the evolution over iterations.

2. **Recursive Strategy**:
   - `recursive_strategy` method showcases a recursive optimization routine using a standard gradient-descent-like approach.
   - `_recursive_update` method applies the recursive update of the state, incorporating calculated gradients at each step.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Simulated with `compute_gradient` function, though in a real scenario, it would involve complex model evaluation and optimization based on real data.

4. **Logging**:
   - Provides valuable insights into the system's internal state and evolution process with both info and debug logs.

This outline serves as a foundational framework, and real-world application would likely involve more sophisticated AI/ML models, error handling, data management, and real-time processing capabilities.
