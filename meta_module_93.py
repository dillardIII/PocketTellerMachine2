Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably, you meant a hypothetical entity) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves orchestrating various components that enable recursive learning, self-improvement, and autonomy. Hereâ€™s a conceptual breakdown and an initial implementation approach:

### Module: Recursive Autonomy Enhancer (RAE)

#### Key Components:

1. **Self-Monitoring and Feedback Loop:**
   - Implements mechanisms to constantly observe system performance, detect anomalies, and collect feedback.
   
2. **Recursive Learning:**
   - Incorporates recursive neural networks to enable self-improvement by learning from the historical states and actions.

3. **Adaptive Decision-Making:**
   - Facilitates a decision-making process that adapts based on current states and predicted future scenarios.

4. **Dynamic Environment Interaction:**
   - Manages interaction schemes with changing environments, handling data from multiple sensors or input sources.

5. **Resource Allocation Optimizer:**
   - Analyzes the system requirements and allocates resources dynamically to optimize performance.

6. **Ethical Compliance and Safety:**
   - Ensures operations align with ethical guidelines and safety standards through checks and assurances.

### High-Level Design:

```python
class RecursiveAutonomyEnhancer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state_history = []
        self.feedback = []
        self.resource_manager = ResourceManager()
        self.decision_maker = AdaptiveDecisionMaker()
        
    def collect_data(self, input_source):
        # Function to collect data from various sources
        data = input_source.get_data()
        self.state_history.append(data)
        self.feedback = self.analyze_feedback(data)
        
    def analyze_feedback(self, data):
        # Analyze system performance and generate feedback
        # Placeholder for actual analysis logic
        return ["feedback based on data analysis"]
        
    def recursive_learn(self):
        # Implement a simple recursive neural network or recursive learning logic
        print("Learning from historical data.")
        # Placeholder for actual learning logic using state_history and feedback
    
    def adapt_decision(self):
        # Make adaptive decisions based on learned patterns
        decision = self.decision_maker.make_decision(self.state_history)
        print("Adjusting strategy based on decision.")
        
    def optimize_resources(self):
        # Optimize resource allocation
        self.resource_manager.allocate_resources()
        
    def ensure_safety(self):
        # Implement safety and ethical checks
        print("Performing safety checks.")
        
    def run_cycle(self, input_source):
        # Complete cycle of self-evolution and adaptation
        self.collect_data(input_source)
        self.recursive_learn()
        self.adapt_decision()
        self.optimize_resources()
        self.ensure_safety()

class ResourceManager:
    def allocate_resources(self):
        # Manage resource allocation logic
        print("Allocating resources optimally.")
        
class AdaptiveDecisionMaker:
    def make_decision(self, state_history):
        # Implement adaptive decision-making logic based on historical data
        print("Making decision based on historical context.")
        return "optimum_strategy"

```

### Considerations for Expansion:

1. **Scalability:**
   - Ensure that the module architecture can handle increased data input and expand functionalities without degrading performance.

2. **Integration with Existing Systems:**
   - Design APIs or interfaces that allow seamless integration with other modules within the PTM stack.

3. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Employ rigorous testing to validate the recursive strategies and decision-making processes.

4. **Security:**
   - Incorporate robust security measures to protect the autonomy stack from unauthorized accesses and vulnerabilities.

5. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - Implement continuous monitoring and refinement protocols to enhance performance over time.

This module provides a highly abstract prototype. In practice, you would need to refine algorithms, integrate actual neural networks, leverage advanced machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, and ensure robust real-time capabilities.
