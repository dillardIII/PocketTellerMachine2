Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "Perpetual Technology Machine") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating advanced algorithms, leveraging cutting-edge technologies, and ensuring seamless adaptability and scalability. Below is a conceptual design with innovative strategies:

### Module Name: `AutonomousEvolution`

#### Key Components:

1. **Algorithmic Core**:
    - **Self-Learning Neural Networks**: Use meta-learning algorithms to allow models to learn new tasks with minimal data. Implementations could focus on Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) or Prototypical Networks.

    ```python
    class SelfLearningNN:
        def __init__(self, base_model):
            self.base_model = base_model

        def meta_train(self, tasks):
            # Implement MAML or another meta-learning strategy
            pass

        def adapt_to_new_task(self, task_data):
            # Adjust model parameters quickly for new tasks
            pass
    ```

2. **Reinforcement Learning Agents**:
    - **Hierarchical RL**: Implement a hierarchical architecture in reinforcement learning to manage complex decision-making effectively.
    - **Continuous Adaptation**: Develop agents that can adapt policies based on environmental feedback and intrinsic motivation measures.

    ```python
    class HierarchicalRLAgent:
        def __init__(self, high_level_policy, low_level_policy):
            self.high_level_policy = high_level_policy
            self.low_level_policy = low_level_policy

        def train(self, environment):
            # Train both high-level and low-level policies
            pass

        def adapt(self, environment_feedback):
            # Use feedback to refine policies
            pass
    ```

3. **Autonomous Data Pipeline**:
    - **Dynamic Data Fusion**: Combine different data sources dynamically to ensure robust decision-making. Use sensor fusion techniques such as Kalman Filters and Bayesian Filters.
    - **Automated Data Curation**: Implement pipelines for automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes using tools like Apache Airflow or Prefect.

    ```python
    class DataFusionPipeline:
        def __init__(self, data_sources):
            self.data_sources = data_sources

        def fuse_data(self):
            # Implement sensor fusion logic
            pass

        def automate_etl(self, raw_data):
            # ETL logic for transforming raw data into a usable format
            pass
    ```

4. **Adaptive Planning Module**:
    - **Probabilistic Planning**: Use POMDPs (Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) for planning under uncertainty.
    - **Scenario-based Simulation**: Develop scenario simulation tools to predict outcomes and optimize planning.

    ```python
    class AdaptivePlanner:
        def __init__(self):
            pass

        def plan_with_pomdp(self, state):
            # POMDP-based planning approach
            pass

        def run_simulation(self, scenarios):
            # Simulate scenarios to optimize decision-making
            pass
    ```

5. **Safety and Compliance Layer**:
    - **Formal Verification**: Employ formal methods to ensure safety-critical systems adhere to standards.
    - **Ethical AI Integration**: Develop frameworks to incorporate ethical decision-making guidelines into autonomous systems.

    ```python
    class SafetyCompliance:
        def __init__(self, safety_standards):
            self.safety_standards = safety_standards

        def verify_compliance(self, system_state):
            # Formal verification against safety standards
            pass

        def implement_ethical_guidelines(self, decision_data):
            # Integrate ethical considerations into decision-making
            pass
    ```

#### Integration Strategy:

- **Modular Design**: Each component is designed as a module to allow easy integration and scalability.
- **APIs for Interoperability**: Develop robust APIs for seamless communication between different modules, ensuring a cohesive system.
- **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback Loop**: Implement monitoring systems to provide continuous feedback and adjust strategies as necessary.

#### Tools and Technologies:

- **Machine Learning Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch for deep learning.
- **Reinforcement Learning Frameworks**: OpenAI Gym, Ray RLib for training RL agents.
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, and Apache Kafka for data streaming.
- **Simulation and Planning**: ROS (Robot Operating System), SimPy for simulation environments.

These strategies and components provide a blueprint for expanding the PTM empireâ€™s self-evolving autonomy stack, focusing on adaptability, scalability, and integration of ethical considerations.
