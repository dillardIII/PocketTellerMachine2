Designing a Python module to expand the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating advanced recursive strategies to facilitate autonomous decision-making and system adaptation. Below is a conceptual design of such a module, focusing on recursive techniques, modular architecture, and adaptability.

### Module: `autonomy_stack`

#### Overview
The `autonomy_stack` module will be at the heart of the PTM empire's autonomous system. It integrates recursive algorithms to enable self-evolving capabilities, allowing the system to iteratively refine its processes and decision-making strategies based on real-time data and feedback.

#### Key Components

1. **Recursive Learning Engine (`RecursiveLearner`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Enable recursive improvements by continually refining models based on new inputs and outcomes.
   - **Features**:
     - Recursive adjustments using feedback loops.
     - Integration with machine learning models for predictive capabilities.
     - Hierarchical decision-making using recursive structures.

2. **Feedback Analysis (`FeedbackProcessor`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Collect and analyze feedback from various modules to guide system adaptation.
   - **Features**:
     - Aggregation of feedback from different system components.
     - Sentiment and trend analysis.
     - Recursive feedback utilization to refine processing logic.

3. **Autonomous Decision-Making (`Decider`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Make autonomous decisions based on a continuously evolving set of rules and data.
   - **Features**:
     - Rule-based and ML-based decision-making hybrid model.
     - Recursive evaluation of outcomes to improve future decisions.
     - Scenario simulation and recursive optimization.

4. **Self-Evolving Knowledge Base (`KnowledgeBase`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Maintain and evolve a knowledge repository for informed decision-making.
   - **Features**:
     - Storage and retrieval of data and decision precedence.
     - Recursive pattern recognition for knowledge enhancement.
     - Integration with external data sources for comprehensive knowledge growth.

5. **System Monitor and Logger (`SystemMonitor`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Monitor system performance and log decisions and outcomes for recursive evaluation.
   - **Features**:
     - Real-time performance metrics.
     - Recursive log analysis for identifying process improvements.
     - Alerts and notifications for significant anomalies.

#### Sample Code Structure

```python
class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, initial_model):
        self.model = initial_model

    def refine_model(self, input_data, feedback):
        # Recursive logic to improve the model
        updated_model = self.model.train(input_data, feedback)
        self.model = updated_model
        return self.model

class FeedbackProcessor:
    def process_feedback(self, feedback_data):
        # Analyze feedback and prepare for use
        aggregated_feedback = self.aggregate(feedback_data)
        return aggregated_feedback
    
    def aggregate(self, feedback_data):
        # Example of feedback aggregation
        return sum(feedback_data) / len(feedback_data)

class Decider:
    def decide(self, context_data):
        # Use a recursive strategy to make decisions
        decision = self.evaluate_options(context_data)
        return decision

    def evaluate_options(self, context_data):
        # Simple recursive decision logic
        # In a real use case, it will be more complex
        return max(context_data, key=lambda option: self.heuristic(option))

    def heuristic(self, option):
        # Define a heuristic for decision-making
        return option["score"]

class KnowledgeBase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}

    def update_knowledge(self, new_information):
        # Recursive pattern recognition and knowledge updating
        self.data.update(new_information)

class SystemMonitor:
    def log_decision(self, decision, outcome):
        # Recursive log evaluation
        print(f"Decision: {decision}, Outcome: {outcome}")
```

#### Execution Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Load initial models and knowledge bases.
2. **Continuous Operation**: 
   - Gather data.
   - Process and analyze feedback.
   - Make decisions using `Decider`.
   - Refine knowledge and models using recursive methods.
   - Monitor system performance and log outcomes.
3. **Feedback Loops**: Use recursive strategies to refine processes based on feedback, striving for continuous improvement.

### Conclusion
The `autonomy_stack` module is designed to harness recursive strategies to enhance autonomous capabilities within the PTM empire's infrastructure. By incorporating recursive learning, feedback processing, autonomous decision-making, and a self-evolving knowledge base, this module lays the foundation for highly adaptive and intelligent autonomous systems.
