Creating an advanced Python module that incorporates intelligent recursion and aligns with a fictional "unstoppable PTM empire" theme requires a blend of imagination and technical detail. Below is a step-by-step outline followed by the actual code for a Python module named `ptm_recursion`.

### Module Overview
The module `ptm_recursion` will include:
1. **RecursiveDataProcessor**: A class designed to handle recursion for complex data structures.
2. **intelligent_recurse**: A function that intelligently processes nested data structures like lists, dictionaries, and custom classes.
3. **Advanced Use Cases**: Methods that showcase advanced applications of the recursive processing.

### Module: `ptm_recursion`
```python
# ptm_recursion.py

class RecursiveDataProcessor:
    """
    A class that intelligently processes recursive data structures for the PTM empire.
    """

    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def intelligent_recurse(self, action, condition=None):
        """
        Recursively applies an action to elements within the data structure
        that meet a specified condition.

        :param action: A function to apply to each element.
        :param condition: A function that returns True for elements to be processed.
        :return: Processed data structure.
        """
        def recurse(element):
            if condition and not condition(element):
                return element

            if isinstance(element, list):
                return [recurse(sub) for sub in element]
            elif isinstance(element, dict):
                return {key: recurse(value) for key, value in element.items()}

            # Apply the action if it's a leaf node, according to the condition:
            return action(element) if condition is None or condition(element) else element:
:
        return recurse(self.data)

    def flatten_structure(self):
        """
        Flattens nested data structures (lists) into a single list.

        :return: A flat list of all elements in the data structure.
        """
        flat_list = []

        def flatten(element):
            if isinstance(element, list):
                for sub in element:
                    flatten(sub)
            else:
                flat_list.append(element)

        flatten(self.data)
        return flat_list

    def filter_and_process(self, filter_condition, process_function):
        """
        Filters elements based on a condition and processes them with a given function.

        :param filter_condition: Function to filter elements.
        :param process_function: Function to process filtered elements.
        :return: List of processed elements.
        """
        filtered_processed = []

        def process(element):
            if isinstance(element, list):
                for sub in element:
                    process(sub)
            elif filter_condition(element):
                filtered_processed.append(process_function(element))

        process(self.data)
        return filtered_processed

# Example Usage

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Example input data (nested list and dictionary)
    data = {
        'numbers': [1, 2, [3, 4, {'key': 5}], 6],
        'letters': ['a', ['b', ['c', 'd']]],
    }

    processor = RecursiveDataProcessor(data)

    # Define simple action and condition functions for demonstration
    def double(x):
        return x * 2

    def is_number(x):
        return isinstance(x, int)

    # Apply intelligent recursion
    doubled_numbers = processor.intelligent_recurse(action=double, condition=is_number)
    print("Doubled Numbers:", doubled_numbers)

    # Flatten structure
    flat_data = processor.flatten_structure()
    print("Flattened Data:", flat_data)

    # Filter and process
    processed_data = processor.filter_and_process(is_number, double)
    print("Processed Data (Filtered & Doubled):", processed_data)
```

### Explanation
- **RecursiveDataProcessor**: This class can manage complex and nested data structures.
- **intelligent_recurse**: This method recursively applies an action (like a function) to elements that satisfy a certain condition, providing flexibility in processing the data structure.
- **flatten_structure**: This method recursively flattens nested lists.
- **filter_and_process**: This method filters out elements based on a condition and then processes them with a given function.
- **Example Usage**: Demonstrates how to use the class with a nested data structure, implement doubling numeric values, flattening lists, and filtering and processing data.

This module is a creative blend of recursion and straightforward application that showcases powerful data processing methods within a fictional "PTM empire."
