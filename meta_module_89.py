Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Pre-trained Model) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating advanced recursive strategies to enable adaptive and autonomous behavior in AI systems. Below, I'll outline a conceptual design for such a module, named `ptm_autonomy`, which leverages recursion and self-evolution principles to enhance the decision-making capabilities of an AI stack. This design will include key classes, methods, and a brief description of their functionality.

### Module: `ptm_autonomy`

```python
# ptm_autonomy/__init__.py

from .autonomy_core import AutonomyEngine, RecursiveLearningAgent

__all__ = ['AutonomyEngine', 'RecursiveLearningAgent']
```

### Core Components

1. **AutonomyEngine**: This is the heart of the autonomy stack, managing the orchestration of recursive strategies and overseeing the learning agents' evolution.

2. **RecursiveLearningAgent**: This class represents an agent capable of learning and adapting through recursive strategies. It employs self-improvement loops to refine its performance over time.

### Core Implementation

```python
# ptm_autonomy/autonomy_core.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator
from copy import deepcopy
from typing import Callable

class AutonomyEngine:
    def __init__(self, agent: 'RecursiveLearningAgent'):
        self.agent = agent

    def evolve(self, iterations: int = 10):
        """
        Evolves the agent by executing its recursive learning strategy.
        """
        for iteration in range(iterations):
            print(f"Evolution iteration {iteration + 1}/{iterations}")
            self.agent.recursive_strategy()

class RecursiveLearningAgent(BaseEstimator):
    def __init__(self, model, data_generator: Callable, fitness_function: Callable):
        """
        Initializes the recursive learning agent.

        :param model: The initial model to be improved.
        :param data_generator: A function to generate synthetic data.
        :param fitness_function: A function to evaluate the agent's performance.
        """
        self.model = model
        self.data_generator = data_generator
        self.fitness_function = fitness_function

    def recursive_strategy(self):
        """
        Executes the recursive learning strategy of the agent.
        """
        synthetic_data = self.data_generator()
        current_performance = self.fitness_function(self.model, synthetic_data)
        print(f"Current performance: {current_performance}")

        # Create a perturbed clone of the model
        clone = deepcopy(self.model)
        self._perturb_model(clone)

        # Evaluate the perturbed model
        perturbed_performance = self.fitness_function(clone, synthetic_data)
        print(f"Perturbed performance: {perturbed_performance}")

        # Replace the model if the perturbed model is better:
        if perturbed_performance > current_performance:
            print("Updating model to the improved version.")
            self.model = clone

    def _perturb_model(self, model):
        """
        Perturbs the model's parameters slightly to explore the search space.
        """
        params = model.get_params()
        perturbed_params = {k: v + np.random.normal(0, 0.1) for k, v in params.items()}
        model.set_params(**perturbed_params)

```

### Key Features

- **Recursive Strategy Execution**: The `RecursiveLearningAgent` applies a continuous loop of learning, perturbing its internal model and using a fitness function to assess improvements. This enables the agent to self-improve iteratively.

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: The use of a `data_generator` allows agents to generate new scenarios or data points, promoting diverse learning experiences and preventing overfitting.

- **Model Perturbation**: The `_perturb_model` method introduces small changes to the model parameters. This facilitates exploration of the solution space to discover potentially better configurations.

- **Autonomy and Evolution**: The `AutonomyEngine` manages the broader strategy, enabling recursive evolution across multiple iterations, which can be adjusted to match the complexity and depth required by the application.

### Integration and Usage

To use this module, instantiate a `RecursiveLearningAgent` with a machine learning model, a custom data generator, and a fitness function that evaluates model performance. Then, manage the evolutionary process using the `AutonomyEngine`.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def mock_data_generator():
    # Generates synthetic data for testing
    return np.random.rand(100, 2), np.random.rand(100)

def mock_fitness_function(model, data):
    # Evaluates model performance on synthetic data
    X, y = data
    predictions = model.predict(X)
    return -np.mean((y - predictions) ** 2)  # Negative MSE for minimization

# Initialize components
initial_model = LinearRegression()
agent = RecursiveLearningAgent(model=initial_model,
                               data_generator=mock_data_generator,
                               fitness_function=mock_fitness_function)

# Create and execute the autonomy engine
engine = AutonomyEngine(agent)
engine.evolve(iterations=5)
```

### Final Thoughts

The `ptm_autonomy` module provides a flexible structure to implement recursive learning and self-improvement strategies for AI systems. By focusing on model perturbation and performance-driven evolution, it empowers agents with enhanced autonomy, adaptability, and self-evolving capabilities. Further enhancements could include integrating neural network models, multithreading for parallel learning, or advanced optimization techniques for more efficient exploration of the parameter space.
