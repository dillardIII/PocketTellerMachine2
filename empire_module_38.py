Creating an advanced Python module for an "unstoppable PTM empire" with intelligent recursion requires a deep understanding of the problem domain and the application of efficient and innovative recursive strategies. Below is an example of how you might construct such a module, complete with intelligent recursion techniques. For the sake of this example, let's assume that PTM refers to a complex Problem Transformation Matrix, where solutions are derived through recursive strategies.

Here's an outline and code for an advanced module called `ptm_empire`:

```python
# ptm_empire.py

class PTMEmpire:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memoization = {}

    def intelligent_recursion(self, problem):
        """
        Solves the problem using intelligent recursion with memoization.
        
        :param problem: The input problem to solve.
        :return: The solution to the problem.
        """
        # Check if we have already solved this problem:
        if problem in self.memoization:
            return self.memoization[problem]

        if self.is_base_case(problem):
            solution = self.solve_base_case(problem)
        else:
            subproblems = self.transform_problem(problem)
            subsolutions = [self.intelligent_recursion(sub) for sub in subproblems]
            solution = self.combine_solutions(subsolutions)

        # Memorize the computed solution
        self.memoization[problem] = solution
        return solution

    def is_base_case(self, problem):
        """
        Determines if the problem is a base case.:
        """
        # Dummy check for example, replace with actual logic
        return isinstance(problem, int) and problem <= 1

    def solve_base_case(self, problem):
        """
        Solves the base case problem.
        """
        # Replace with actual base case solution
        return problem

    def transform_problem(self, problem):
        """
        Transforms the problem into smaller subproblems.
        """
        # Dummy transformation for example, replace with actual logic
        return [problem - 1, problem - 2]

    def combine_solutions(self, subsolutions):
        """
        Combines the solutions of subproblems into a full solution.
        """
        # Replace with actual logic to combine subsolutions
        return sum(subsolutions)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    empire_solver = PTMEmpire()
    problem = 10  # Example problem size
    solution = empire_solver.intelligent_recursion(problem)
    print(f"Solution to problem {problem} is {solution}")
```

### Key Concepts in this Module

1. **Memoization**: This technique stores the results of expensive function calls and re-uses them when the same inputs occur again, thus saving computation time.

2. **Problem Transformation Matrix (PTM)**: The process of breaking down a complex problem into simpler subproblems. In this template, `transform_problem` is responsible for this transformation.

3. **Recursive Solution**: The `intelligent_recursion` function is the core recursive function that intelligently decides when a subproblem or base case has been solved and structures the way solutions are combined.

4. **Base Case Recognition**: It's vital to recognize when a problem can be solved directly without further recursion. `is_base_case` and `solve_base_case` handle this logic.

5. **Combination of Subsolutions**: Once subproblems are solved, their solutions need to be combined into a solution for the original problem, handled by `combine_solutions`.

### Note
This code is illustrative. Depending on the specific application and domain of the "PTM empire," actual implementation details in `transform_problem`, `solve_base_case`, `combine_solutions`, and checking the base case would be different. The concept shown can be expanded and refined to handle specific recursive challenges with greater complexity and various intelligent techniques tailored to the problem set.
