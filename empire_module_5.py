Creating an advanced Python module for a hypothetical "unstoppable PTM (Presumably Powerful Transactional Mechanism) empire" with intelligent recursion involves designing a module that leverages recursive algorithms to handle complex problems efficiently. A typical use case for recursion involves tasks like parsing hierarchical data, solving combinatorial problems, or navigating through complex structures like graphs or trees.

Below is an example Python module that demonstrates intelligent recursion by implementing a few recursive functions to handle common advanced tasks. The module includes error handling, logging, and optimization techniques like memoization to enhance efficiency.

### How it works:

1. **Factorial Function**: Computes the factorial of a non-negative integer `n` recursively, with error handling for negative numbers.

2. **Fibonacci Function**: Uses memoization (via `functools.lru_cache`) to cache previously computed results, optimizing the recursive computation of Fibonacci numbers.

3. **Maze Path Finder**: Recursively explores a maze represented as a 2D grid, finding all possible paths from the top-left to the bottom-right, considering only valid moves (i.e., staying within the boundaries of the maze and only moving through passable cells).

Each function is designed to leverage recursion efficiently, handle errors gracefully, and log the computations at appropriate levels.

### Usage:

- Perform factorial calculations by calling `factorial(n)`.
- Compute Fibonacci numbers using `fibonacci(n)`.
- Find all paths in a maze by using the `find_paths(maze, x, y)` with a grid representation of the maze.

Remember, recursion can be powerful but should be used judiciously to avoid stack overflow issues, especially in Python, which has a relatively low default recursion depth limit. However, intelligent mechanisms like memoization can significantly enhance performance for appropriate problems.
