Creating a sophisticated Python module for an "unstoppable PTM empire" with intelligent recursion requires thoughtful design to ensure it's both robust and efficient. Let's create a simplified version that showcases recursion in solving complex problems, optimizing recursion with techniques like memoization, and structuring the module for reuse and scalability.

This example module will provide recursive solutions for tasks like computing Fibonacci numbers (a classic example), solving the Tower of Hanoi problem, and exploring permutations of a given list. We'll use recursion intelligently by including memoization for optimizing operations like Fibonacci calculations.

```python
# intelligent_recursion.py

class RecursionError(Exception):
    pass

def fibonacci(n, memo=None):
    """Calculate the n-th Fibonacci number using recursion with memoization."""
    if memo is None:
        memo = {}
    
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    
    if n <= 0:
        raise RecursionError("Invalid input: Fibonacci sequence is defined for positive integers.")
    elif n in {1, 2}:
        return 1
    
    result = fibonacci(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci(n - 2, memo)
    memo[n] = result
    return result

def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves=None):
    """
    Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with a recursive approach.
    :param n: Number of disks
    :param source: Initial rod
    :param target: Target rod
    :param auxiliary: Auxiliary rod
    :param moves: Log of moves
    :return: List of moves
    """
    if moves is None:
        moves = []

    if n <= 0:
        raise RecursionError("Invalid input: Number of disks must be positive.")

    if n == 1:
        moves.append((source, target))
    else:
        tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
        moves.append((source, target))
        tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)
    
    return moves

def permutations(elements):
    """
    Generate all permutations of a list using recursion.
    :param elements: List of elements
    :return: List of permutations
    """
    if not elements:
        return [[]]
    
    result = []
    for i in range(len(elements)):
        elem = elements[i]
        for perm in permutations(elements[:i] + elements[i+1:]):
            result.append([elem] + perm)
    
    return result

# Example of using the module
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        # Fibonacci
        print("Fibonacci(10):", fibonacci(10))

        # Tower of Hanoi
        hanoi_moves = tower_of_hanoi(3, 'A', 'C', 'B')
        print("Tower of Hanoi moves for 3 disks:", hanoi_moves)

        # Permutations
        perm_list = permutations([1, 2, 3])
        print("Permutations of [1, 2, 3]:", perm_list)
        
    except RecursionError as e:
        print(f"Recursion Error: {e}")
```

### Key Features:
1. **Memoization**: Optimizes the Fibonacci calculation by storing results of already computed terms.
2. **Error Handling**: Custom error class `RecursionError` to handle invalid inputs gracefully.
3. **Flexibility**: Functions can be used independently or as part of a larger recursive problem-solving toolkit.
4. **Modularization**: Each function is self-contained, easy to test, and can be expanded with additional features as needed.

This module serves as a foundation for exploring advanced recursion techniques in Python. You can extend functionality by adding more complex problems, optimizing further with dynamic programming, or integrating this module into larger projects.
