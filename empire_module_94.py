Creating a new advanced Python module with intelligent recursion can be an exciting challenge! Below is an example of a Python module that embodies intelligent recursion. This module includes a recursive function that optimizes its recursive calls using memoization, a common technique to improve the efficiency of recursive solutions by storing previously computed results.

Let's define a module that provides an intelligent recursive function to solve the classic problem of computing Fibonacci numbers efficiently using memoization:

```python
# file: intelligent_recursion.py

class Memoize:
    """Decorator class for memoizing function results."""
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
        self.memo = {}

    def __call__(self, *args):
        if args not in self.memo:
            self.memo[args] = self.func(*args)
        return self.memo[args]

def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Compute the nth Fibonacci number using intelligent recursion and memoization.

    :param n: An integer indicating the position in the Fibonacci sequence.
    :return: The Fibonacci number at position n.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Fibonacci number is only defined for positive integers.")
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

# Apply memoization to make recursion efficient
fibonacci = Memoize(fibonacci)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        position = 10
        print(f"Fibonacci number at position {position}: {fibonacci(position)}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
```

### Explanation

- **Memoize Decorator:** The `Memoize` class acts as a decorator to cache the results of a function based on its input arguments. When the decorated function is called with a particular set of arguments, the decorator first checks if the result is already computed and stored. If it is, the cached result is returned; otherwise, the function is called, and the result is stored for future use.:
:
- **Fibonacci Function:** This function demonstrates intelligent recursion, leveraging the memoization technique. The base cases handle the simplest known results of the Fibonacci sequence, while the recursive case uses memoization to prevent redundant computations.

- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is introduced to ensure the function is called with valid arguments (positive integers), raising a `ValueError` otherwise.

This module can be expanded with other recursive algorithms or be further integrated within a larger framework for solving similar classes of problems. Adjustments can be made to handle other recursion-related tasks while utilizing similar strategies for performance enhancement.
