Developing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably to mean "Part-Time Masters" or any other entity you might refer to) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies is an exciting challenge. Below is a conceptual design for such a module. The focus will be on creating an adaptive and self-improving system that utilizes machine learning techniques with a recursive approach.

### Module: `autonomy_stack`

#### Objectives:
1. **Self-Evolution**: The module should allow autonomous systems to adapt and evolve without external input.
2. **Recursive Strategies**: Implement recursive learning and decision-making processes to enhance adaptability.

#### Key Components
1. **Environment Interface**: A standard interface to interact with and learn from different environments.
2. **Recursive Learning Engine**: Recursive algorithms to continuously improve models.
3. **Adaptive Decision System**: A decision-making framework that evolves based on feedback.
4. **Performance Tracking**: Tools to monitor and evaluate the autonomy stack's performance.

### Module Explanation:
- **EnvironmentInterface**: Serves as a template for environments. Each specific environment should subclass this to provide specific behaviors.
- **RecursiveLearningEngine**: Uses recursive strategies to fit models. It recursively addresses prediction errors to enhance learning.
- **AdaptiveDecisionSystem**: Evolves decision strategies using recursive evaluation and adaptation.
- **PerformanceTracker**: Captures and reports on the performance of evolving autonomous strategies.

This modular setup is flexible enough to support different machine learning models and can be expanded to include more complex recursive strategies and algorithms, ensuring scalability and adaptability over time. The example provided at the end demonstrates its use in a simple environment with logistic regression, showcasing how these components can fit together in practice.
