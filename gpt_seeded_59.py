Let's create a Python utility for a strategy or empire game that focuses on resource management, which is often a crucial aspect of such games. This utility will include functions to manage resources, simulate resource production, and handle upgrades for buildings that improve production efficiency.

Suppose your empire manages three primary resources: Gold, Wood, and Stone. You also have different levels of production buildings that can be upgraded over time. Here's a basic version of such a utility:

```python
class Resource:
    def __init__(self, name, amount=0):
        self.name = name
        self.amount = amount

    def add(self, quantity):
        self.amount += quantity
        print(f"{quantity} {self.name} added. Total: {self.amount}")

    def deduct(self, quantity):
        if quantity <= self.amount:
            self.amount -= quantity
            print(f"{quantity} {self.name} deducted. Total: {self.amount}")
        else:
            print(f"Not enough {self.name} to deduct. Available: {self.amount}")

class Building:
    def __init__(self, name, level=1, base_production=10):
        self.name = name
        self.level = level
        self.base_production = base_production

    def upgrade(self):
        self.level += 1
        print(f"{self.name} upgraded to level {self.level}")

    def production_rate(self):
        return self.base_production * self.level

class Empire:
    def __init__(self):
        self.resources = {
            "Gold": Resource("Gold"),
            "Wood": Resource("Wood"),
            "Stone": Resource("Stone")
        }
        self.buildings = {
            "Gold Mine": Building("Gold Mine"),
            "Sawmill": Building("Sawmill"),
            "Quarry": Building("Quarry")
        }

    def produce_resources(self):
        for building_name, building in self.buildings.items():
            rate = building.production_rate()
            resource_name = building_name.split()[0]  # Assumes format like "Gold Mine"
            self.resources[resource_name].add(rate)

    def upgrade_building(self, building_name):
        if building_name in self.buildings:
            self.buildings[building_name].upgrade()
        else:
            print(f"No building named {building_name} found.")

    def show_resources(self):
        for resource in self.resources.values():
            print(f"{resource.name}: {resource.amount}")

# Example of using the Empire utility
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_empire = Empire()

    # Simulate resource production
    print("\n*** Simulating Resource Production ***")
    my_empire.produce_resources()

    # Show resource totals
    print("\n*** Current Resources ***")
    my_empire.show_resources()

    # Upgrade a building
    print("\n*** Upgrading Building ***")
    my_empire.upgrade_building("Sawmill")

    # Simulate another round of resource production
    print("\n*** Simulating Another Production Cycle ***")
    my_empire.produce_resources()

    # Show updated resource totals
    print("\n*** Updated Resources ***")
    my_empire.show_resources()
```

### How the Utility Works

- **Resource Class**: Manages individual resources, tracking the amount and handling additions and deductions.
- **Building Class**: Represents different production facilities, with levels affecting their production rates.
- **Empire Class**: Manages all resources and buildings, facilitating production cycles and upgrades.

This is a basic utility that can be extended with functionalities such as:
- Costs for upgrading buildings.
- Time-based production (e.g., producing resources over real or simulated game time).
- More complex interactions and features commonly found in strategy games.

This code forms the foundation of a resource management system for a strategy or empire game, providing players with necessary tools to manage their empires efficiently.
