Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably referring to a hypothetical "Project Task Management" or similar) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves several key components. Hereâ€™s a conceptual overview of how such a module could be structured:

### Module Name: `autonomous_ptm`

#### Key Components:

1. **Recursive Strategy Engine**: 
   - This core component will feature algorithms that can recursively break down complex tasks into sub-tasks, refine strategies, and apply learned experiences to new situations.
   - Use techniques like recursive neural networks, reinforcement learning, and evolutionary algorithms to enable self-improvement and task optimization.

2. **Task Decomposition and Prioritization**:
   - Implement methods to decompose tasks into manageable sub-tasks using natural language processing and logic-based parsing.
   - Use priority queues and decision trees to allocate resources efficiently across tasks recursively.

3. **Dynamic Learning Model**:
   - Integrate machine learning models that adjust priorities and strategies based on feedback loops and new data.
   - Encourage adaptive learning by employing meta-learning strategies (learning to learn) to optimize task execution pathways.

4. **Intelligent Resource Allocation**:
   - Develop algorithms for optimal resource allocation, using combinations of linear programming, deep learning, and constraint satisfaction problems.
   - Implement a mechanism to reallocate resources dynamically in response to task completion rates and evolving requirements.

5. **Feedback and Self-Improvement Mechanism**:
   - Introduce a feedback loop system where the module constantly evaluates its performance on tasks and refines its approach.
   - Implement reinforcement learning techniques to reward successful strategies and phase out inefficient ones.

6. **User Interaction and Interface**:
   - Design a user-friendly interface or API for users to define tasks, set parameters, and receive updates on task hierarchical structures and status.
   - Employ chatbots or intelligent agents for user interaction, enhancing accessibility and ease of use.

#### Example Implementation

Below is a simplified example to illustrate how parts of this module could be implemented:

```python
# autonomous_ptm.py

from queue import PriorityQueue
import numpy as np

class AutonomousPTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.task_queue = PriorityQueue()
        self.learning_model = self.initialize_learning_model()

    def initialize_learning_model(self):
        # Initialize your recursive learning model here
        pass

    def add_task(self, task, priority=0):
        # Recursively analyze and add tasks with priorities
        decomposed_tasks = self.decompose_task(task)
        for dt in decomposed_tasks:
            self.task_queue.put((priority, dt))

    def decompose_task(self, task):
        # Apply NLP and logic-based parsing to decompose tasks
        return [task]  # Simplified for example purposes

    def execute_tasks(self):
        while not self.task_queue.empty():
            priority, task = self.task_queue.get()
            self.perform_task(task)
            # Feedback loop for learning
            self.update_learning_model(task)

    def perform_task(self, task):
        # Execute task, simulate with a print
        print(f"Executing task: {task}")
        # Simulation of success or failure
        success = np.random.choice([True, False])
        return success

    def update_learning_model(self, task):
        # Update the learning model based on execution feedback
        # Implement reinforcement learning update rules here
        pass

# Example usage
autonomous_system = AutonomousPTM()
autonomous_system.add_task("Analyze market trends", priority=1)
autonomous_system.execute_tasks()
```

#### Stretch Goals:
- **Scalability Enhancements**: Integrate distributed computing support to handle massive and complex task networks.
- **Integration with IoT Devices**: Expand the module's capabilities by allowing connection and control of physical devices.

This module aims to provide an integrated, adaptive, and recursive framework to automate and optimize task management in an evolving environment, facilitating the expansion of the PTM empire's autonomy stack.
