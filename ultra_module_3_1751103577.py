Developing a deep learning predictive signal processor for Proprietary Trading Management (PTM) requires a solid understanding of financial markets, time-series data, and deep learning techniques. Below is a high-level outline along with a sample Python code using libraries like TensorFlow and Keras to create a simple predictive model. This example focuses on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is commonly used for time-series prediction tasks.

### Key Steps for Developing the Predictive Signal Processor
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Collect historical price data and other relevant financial indicators.
   - Perform preprocessing, including normalization, handling missing values, and creating features like moving averages or technical indicators.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Engineer meaningful features that may help the model learn the underlying patterns, such as:
     - Price changes.
     - Trading volume.
     - Technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD).

3. **Model Design**:
   - Choose an appropriate architecture. LSTMs are generally effective for time-series data.
   - Define the network layers, including the number of LSTM layers and the size of each layer.

4. **Training the Model**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Define a loss function and optimizer.
   - Train the model and evaluate its performance.

5. **Backtesting and Validation**:
   - Test the model on unseen data.
   - Perform backtesting using historical data to validate predictive signals.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the model to generate trading signals in a real-time trading environment.

7. **Monitoring and Optimization**:
   - Continuously monitor the modelâ€™s performance and fine-tune it as necessary.

### Sample Code

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout

# Data Collection and Preprocessing
def load_data(file_name):
    # Load your dataset as a pandas DataFrame
    df = pd.read_csv(file_name)
    return df

def preprocess_data(df):
    # Use features like prices, volume, and additional technical indicators
    df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
    df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)
    scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
    scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(df)

    return scaled_data, scaler

def create_dataset(data, time_step=1):
    dataX, dataY = [], []
    for i in range(len(data) - time_step - 1):
        a = data[i:(i + time_step), 0]  # Change [0] to desired feature index
        dataX.append(a)
        dataY.append(data[i + time_step, 0])
    return np.array(dataX), np.array(dataY)

# Load and preprocess data
df = load_data('your_data.csv')
scaled_data, scaler = preprocess_data(df)

# Create training and testing datasets
train_size = int(len(scaled_data) * 0.8)
train_data, test_data = scaled_data[0:train_size, :], scaled_data[train_size:len(scaled_data), :]

time_step = 60
X_train, y_train = create_dataset(train_data, time_step)
X_test, y_test = create_dataset(test_data, time_step)

# Reshape input to [sample, time step, feature]
X_train = X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0], X_train.shape[1], 1)
X_test = X_test.reshape(X_test.shape[0], X_test.shape[1], 1)

# Model Design & Training
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(time_step, 1)))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=False))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(units=1))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=64, verbose=1)

# Evaluate the model
train_predict = model.predict(X_train)
test_predict = model.predict(X_test)

# Inverse transform to get actual prices
train_predict = scaler.inverse_transform(train_predict)
test_predict = scaler.inverse_transform(test_predict)
actual_y_test = scaler.inverse_transform(y_test.reshape(-1,1))

# Plot the results
plt.plot(actual_y_test, label='Actual Prices')
plt.plot(test_predict, label='Predicted Prices')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Important Considerations
- **Risk Management**: Always include risk management measures when deploying any trading model, as predictions can be wrong.
- **Data Quality**: Ensure data is clean, contains sufficient history, and reflects all relevant market conditions.
- **Feature Set**: Continuously evaluate and update the feature set to improve predictive power.
- **Regulation Compliance**: Ensure that any trading algorithms comply with relevant financial regulations.

This code provides a basic framework for a predictive model in PTM trading. For a production environment, consider more sophisticated techniques, larger datasets, and additional features.
