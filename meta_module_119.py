Designing a Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably "Personal Transport Module" or "Public Transport Module") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with recursive strategies involves several aspects. We'll create a conceptual framework that outlines the structure and functionality of this module.

### Module Overview

This module, named `AutonomyExpander`, will focus on enhancing the decision-making capabilities of autonomous units using recursive strategies. The module will include adaptive learning, environment simulation, and decision recursion to achieve a higher level of autonomy.

### Key Components

1. **Sensor Integration Layer**: For seamless aggregation of data from various sensors.
2. **Recursive Decision Engine**: Employs recursive strategies to enhance decision-making.
3. **Adaptive Learning Module**: Uses machine learning to learn from past decisions and outcomes.
4. **Environment Simulator**: Simulates potential future scenarios based on current data.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Uses feedback to refine strategies over time.

### Implementation Details

```python
import random
import logging

class Sensor:
    """Provides an interface to retrieve data from various sensors."""

    def read(self):
        # Mock sensor data
        return random.uniform(0, 100)

class EnvironmentSimulator:
    """Simulates different scenarios for predictive analysis."""

    def simulate(self, current_state):
        # Generate future state scenarios
        future_states = [current_state + random.uniform(-5, 5) for _ in range(5)]
        return future_states

class RecursiveDecisionEngine:
    """Implements recursive strategies for autonomous decision making."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []

    def decide(self, current_state, iterations=3):
        logging.debug(f"Deciding with current state: {current_state}")
        if iterations == 0 or current_state < 0:
            logging.debug(f"Terminating recursion with state: {current_state}")
            return current_state

        # Recursive decision making
        next_states = self.simulate_future_states(current_state)
        best_state = max(next_states)  # Choose the best state based on some criteria

        logging.debug(f"Best state chosen: {best_state}")
        
        # Save the decision history
        self.history.append((current_state, best_state))

        # Recursive call
        return self.decide(best_state, iterations - 1)

    def simulate_future_states(self, current_state):
        env_sim = EnvironmentSimulator()
        return env_sim.simulate(current_state)

class AdaptiveLearningModule:
    """Learns from past decisions to update strategy preferences."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = {}  # Simple placeholder for an ML model

    def update_strategy(self, history):
        # Update the learning model based on history
        for current_state, best_state in history:
            # Placeholder logic to update strategies
            self.model[current_state] = best_state

        return self.model

class AutonomyExpander:
    """Main module to orchestrate the self-evolving autonomy stack."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.sensor = Sensor()
        self.recursive_engine = RecursiveDecisionEngine()
        self.learning_module = AdaptiveLearningModule()

    def execute(self):
        current_state = self.sensor.read()
        logging.info(f"Initial sensor read: {current_state}")

        # Perform recursive decision making
        final_state = self.recursive_engine.decide(current_state)
        logging.info(f"Final state after decisions: {final_state}")

        # Update learning module
        self.learning_module.update_strategy(self.recursive_engine.history)

        logging.info("Adaptive learning model updated.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
    autonomy_expander = AutonomyExpander()
    autonomy_expander.execute()
```

### Explanation

1. **Sensor Layer**: Simulates sensor data collection, essential for autonomous decision-making.
2. **Environment Simulation**: Explores possible future states of the environment which guides recursive reasoning.
3. **Recursive Decision Engine**: Makes decisions by examining possible future states recursively, selecting optimal outcomes.
4. **Adaptive Learning Module**: Updates strategy based on past decisions, refining the decision-making process over time.
5. **Orchestration**: The `AutonomyExpander` class orchestrates these components, demonstrating potential use in autonomous systems.

This module utilizes recursion not only for decision-making but also in learning adaptive strategies, combining cutting-edge machine learning with recursive logic for an enhanced autonomous stack.
