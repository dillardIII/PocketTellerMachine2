Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably an acronym related to a company or organization's name) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can learn, adapt, and evolve its capabilities over time. Here's a conceptual design for such a module, incorporating innovative recursive strategies to achieve self-evolution:

### Module Overview
The module, named `PTMSelfEvolver`, is designed to autonomously analyze its performance, learn from data and experiences, and evolve its algorithms and decision-making strategies. It leverages recursive strategies, whereby submodules continuously improve and expand upon their capabilities.

### Key Components

1. **Data Acquisition and Analysis (`DataAnalyzer`)**
   - **Functionality**:
     - Collects data from various sensors, external sources, and system logs.
     - Performs initial processing and labeling.
   - **Innovation**:
     - Utilizes recursive feature extraction to iteratively refine the data for maximum informational content.
   - **Technology**:
     - Uses libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn`.

2. **Knowledge Representation (`KnowledgeBase`)**
   - **Functionality**:
     - Structures discovered patterns and knowledge in an adaptable format.
   - **Innovation**:
     - Employs a recursive ontology system, allowing dynamic restructuring of knowledge hierarchies.
   - **Technology**:
     - Incorporates `RDFLib` for semantic web operations.

3. **Learning and Adaptation (`AdaptiveLearner`)**
   - **Functionality**:
     - Implements machine learning models to adaptively learn from data.
   - **Innovation**:
     - Utilizes recursive neural networks (RNNs) for dynamic temporal sequence processing and evolution.
     - Continuously retrains and prunes models based on feedback loops.
   - **Technology**:
     - Built using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

4. **Decision-making and Planning (`StrategicPlanner`)**
   - **Functionality**:
     - Determines optimal decisions based on current knowledge and objectives.
   - **Innovation**:
     - Integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for recursive strategy optimization.
     - Employs simulation and historical data in iterative planning processes.
   - **Technology**:
     - Utilizes `networkx` for graph-based search and planning.

5. **Feedback and Evaluation (`Evaluator`)**
   - **Functionality**:
     - Monitors system performance and evaluates outcomes.
   - **Innovation**:
     - Implements recursive performance evaluation metrics to iteratively reassess system goals and objectives.
   - **Technology**:
     - Uses `matplotlib` for visualizing performance matrices.

### Core Recursive Strategy

The recursion in this stack is both structural and operational:
- **Structural Recursion**: Each component can invoke and refine itself or its peer components. The `AdaptiveLearner` refines its models based on insights from `KnowledgeBase` and feedback from `Evaluator`.
- **Operational Recursion**: The decision-making process within `StrategicPlanner` involves recursive planning techniques to simulate and evaluate potential decisions before execution.

### Implementation Example

```python
class PTMSelfEvolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_analyzer = DataAnalyzer()
        self.knowledge_base = KnowledgeBase()
        self.adaptive_learner = AdaptiveLearner()
        self.strategic_planner = StrategicPlanner()
        self.evaluator = Evaluator()
    
    def evolve(self):
        data = self.data_analyzer.collect_and_process()
        patterns = self.knowledge_base.update(data)
        self.adaptive_learner.learn(patterns)
        decision_plan = self.strategic_planner.plan()
        outcome = self.execute_plan(decision_plan)
        self.evaluator.evaluate(outcome)
        self.recursive_refinement()  # A recursive strategy for continuous evolution
    
    def recursive_refinement(self):
        # Implementation of recursive strategies for system improvement
        self.data_analyzer.refine()
        self.knowledge_base.restructure()
        self.adaptive_learner.retrain()
        self.strategic_planner.reoptimize()
        self.evaluator.refine_metrics()
```

### Conclusion

This conceptual design sets the foundation for a self-evolving autonomy stack, leveraging recursive strategies for continuous improvement and adaptation. As technology progresses, these components can further evolve to incorporate cutting-edge methodologies, enabling the PTM empire to maintain a competitive edge in autonomous systems.
