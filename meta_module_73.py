Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional empire) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can learn, adapt, and improve its performance over time. Key to this is utilizing recursive strategies that allow components to self-optimize through repeated iterations. Hereâ€™s a high-level design with some innovative strategies that could be employed:

### Module: AutonomyStack

#### Key Components:
1. **NeuralEvolutionEngine**
2. **Recursive Learning Framework**
3. **Adaptive Memory Unit**
4. **Dynamic Strategy Evaluator**
5. **Safety and Ethics Layer**

### 1. NeuralEvolutionEngine
This component drives the evolution of neural networks used in the autonomy stack, optimizing their architecture and weights over time.

**Features:**
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Incorporates crossover, mutation, and selection processes to evolve neural networks.
- **AutoML Integration**: Uses automated machine learning tools to fine-tune hyperparameters.
- **Meta-Learning**: Applies meta-learning so parts of the network can learn how to optimize other parts.

**Sample Code Snippet:**
```python
class NeuralEvolutionEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize evolution parameters
        self.population_size = 100
        self.mutation_rate = 0.01
        self.crossover_rate = 0.5

    def evolve(self, networks):
        # Implement evolution strategy
        pass

    def fitness(self, network):
        # Evaluate the fitness of a network
        return score
```

### 2. Recursive Learning Framework
The framework that allows recursive improvement by continually refining models based on past outcomes.

**Features:**
- **Recursive Feedback Loops**: Integrates previous output into the input space for further refinement.
- **Dynamic Learning Paths**: Adjusts learning strategies based on environment changes or feedback.

**Sample Code Snippet:**
```python
class RecursiveLearningFramework:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model

    def recursive_train(self, data):
        # Recursive training logic
        updated_data = self.model.update(data)
        self.model.train(updated_data)
```

### 3. Adaptive Memory Unit
Stores experiences and selectively recalls them to inform decision-making processes.

**Features:**
- **Experience Replay Mechanism**: Similar to techniques used in reinforcement learning.
- **Memory Compression and Expansion**: Automatically compresses memory based on significance and relevance.

**Sample Code Snippet:**
```python
class AdaptiveMemoryUnit:
    def __init__(self, capacity=1000):
        self.memory = []
        self.capacity = capacity

    def store(self, experience):
        # Store experiences up to a capacity
        if len(self.memory) >= self.capacity:
            self.memory.pop(0)
        self.memory.append(experience)

    def recall(self):
        # Retrieve significant experiences
        return self._retrieve_significant_experiences()

    def _retrieve_significant_experiences(self):
        # Logic to identify significant experiences
        pass
```

### 4. Dynamic Strategy Evaluator
Constantly assesses the performance of strategies and proposes adjustments.

**Features:**
- **Real-time Strategy Adjustment**: Modifies strategy based on current performance metrics.
- **Simulation Tools**: Simulates potential changes and assesses their impacts before implementation.

**Sample Code Snippet:**
```python
class DynamicStrategyEvaluator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_strategy = None

    def evaluate(self, metrics):
        # Evaluate and modify the strategy
        if self._needs_adjustment(metrics):
            self._adjust_strategy()

    def _needs_adjustment(self, metrics):
        # Criteria to assess if adjustment is needed:
        pass

    def _adjust_strategy(self):
        # Logic to adjust strategies
        pass
```

### 5. Safety and Ethics Layer
Ensures the autonomy stack operates within predefined ethical and safety boundaries.

**Features:**
- **Ethical Rule Set**: Implements ethical guidelines as enforceable rules.
- **Fail-Safe Mechanisms**: Introduces checks to prevent failure modes and unethical actions.

**Sample Code Snippet:**
```python
class SafetyAndEthicsLayer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ethical_guidelines = []

    def enforce(self, actions):
        # Ensure actions comply with ethical standards
        for action in actions:
            if not self._is_ethical(action):
                self._halt_action(action)

    def _is_ethical(self, action):
        # Logic to determine if an action is ethical:
        pass

    def _halt_action(self, action):
        # Logic to prevent unethical action
        pass
```

### Conclusion
This module design combines state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with recursive strategies to create a self-sustaining autonomy stack. Each component plays a critical role in ensuring the system learns, evolves, and acts within predefined ethical and safety guidelines. This module provides a framework on which complex autonomous systems can be built and iteratively improved.
