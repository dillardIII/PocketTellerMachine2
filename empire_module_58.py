Creating a Python module for an "unstoppable PTM empire" that utilizes advanced concepts like intelligent recursion sounds like a fun and challenging project. Below is a high-level design for such a module, combining recursion with some advanced features, such as memoization, decorators, and type annotations, to create potentially more intelligent recursive functions.

Let's make an example module that handles complex mathematical operations involving recursion. A practical example might involve recursive calculations for certain sequences or problems like the "Unstoppable Growth Sequence" (UGS). For our purposes, we'll define UGS as a hypothetical mathematical sequence that we're interested in computing efficiently using recursion.

```python
# unstoppable_ptm.py

from typing import Dict, Callable
from functools import lru_cache, wraps


def intelligent_recursion():> Callable:
    """
    A decorator to enhance a recursive function with memoization and logging capabilities.
    """
    memo: Dict = {}

    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args in memo:
            print(f"Fetching from memo: {args} -> {memo[args]}")
            return memo[args]
        else:
            result = func(*args)
            print(f"Computing: {args} -> {result}")
            memo[args] = result
            return result

    return wrapper


@intelligent_recursion
def ugs():> int:
    """
    Calculate the n-th element of the Unstoppable Growth Sequence using intelligent recursion.
    Hypothetical sequence formula: UGS(n) = UGS(n-1) + UGS(n-2) + UGS(n-3), with base cases defined.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input cannot be negative.")
    if n == 0:
        return 1  # Base case
    if n == 1:
        return 2  # Base case
    if n == 2:
        return 4  # Base case

    # Perform the recursive step by summing the previous three values
    return ugs(n - 1) + ugs(n - 2) + ugs(n - 3)


@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def factorial():> int:
    """
    Calculate factorial using recursion with memoization to demonstrate recursion for another task.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input cannot be negative.")
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1

    return n * factorial(n - 1)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    try:
        print("Unstoppable Growth Sequence:")
        print(", ".join(str(ugs(i)) for i in range(10)))

        print("\nFactorials:")
        print(", ".join(f"{i}! = {factorial(i)}" for i in range(10)))
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### Key Features:

1. **Memoization with a Decorator**: Uses a custom `intelligent_recursion` decorator to cache the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when a function is called with the same arguments again.

2. **Type Annotations**: This helps with static type checking and makes the code more self-documenting.

3. **Logging**: It informs when a computation is done versus fetching a result from memory.

4. **Advanced Recursion**: A complex sequence (`ugs`) is computed using recursion, exemplified by a hypothetical Unstoppable Growth Sequence problem.

5. **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling to address common issues.

6. **LRU Cache**: Utilizes `functools.lru_cache` for factorial computation to optimize recursive calls further by caching them.

This module provides examples of using recursion in efficient and maintainable ways, demonstrating how complex recursive computations can be tackled in Python using advanced techniques.
