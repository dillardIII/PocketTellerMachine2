Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack can be approached by integrating recursive strategies and advanced machine learning techniques. Below is a high-level design proposal for such a module. This module will focus on self-improvement and adaptability, leveraging recursive learning, meta-learning, and evolutionary algorithms.

### Module Name: `ptm_auto_evo`

#### Key Features

1. **Recursive Neural Networks**:
   - Implement recursive neural networks to process varying structured inputs.
   - Use them for tasks where hierarchical data representation is advantageous (e.g., natural language parsing).

2. **Meta-Learning (Learning to Learn)**:
   - Implement algorithms that enhance the model’s ability to learn new tasks quickly using limited data.
   - Use techniques like Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML).

3. **Evolutionary Algorithms**:
   - Integrate evolutionary strategies for hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search.
   - Use genetic algorithms to simulate evolution, allowing the model to explore a vast space of solutions.

4. **Multi-Agent Systems**:
   - Enable the system to subdivide tasks into modules that can be solved by interacting agents.
   - Utilize cooperative and competitive strategies to enhance overall performance and adaptability.

5. **Self-Improving Mechanisms**:
   - Design self-assessment modules to identify weaknesses and trigger model revisions.
   - Implement reinforcement learning systems where agents learn the most rewarding strategies over time.

#### Implementation Plan

1. **Recursive Strategy**:
   - Develop a `RecursiveNN` class that can manage recursive learning tasks.
   - Implement methods for forward and backward propagation that respect recursive data structures.

2. **Meta-Learning Implementation**:
   - Create a `MetaLearner` class that adapts models for new tasks using minimal data.
   - Implement both gradient-based meta-learning and reinforcement-based strategies.

3. **Evolutionary Approach**:
   - Develop `EvolutionaryOptimizer` classes for optimizing architectures and hyperparameters.
   - Implement crossover, mutation, and selection operations.

4. **Agent Framework**:
   - Build a `MultiAgentSystem` class to handle distributed problem solving.
   - Use communication protocols and negotiation tactics among agents.

5. **Continuous Learning and Improvement**:
   - Design a `SelfImprovingModule` for monitoring performance metrics and triggering retraining.
   - Incorporate a logging and feedback system using reinforcement signals.

        # Recursive backpropagation
        pass

# Meta-Learning Implementation
class MetaLearner:
    def __init__(self, base_model):
        self.base_model = base_model
    
    def adapt(self, task_data):
        # Implement adaptation logic for new tasks
        pass

# Evolutionary Algorithm
class EvolutionaryOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, population_size):
        self.population_size = population_size
    
    def evolve(self):
        # Implement evolutionary strategy
        pass

# Multi-Agent System
class MultiAgentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialization for multi-agent management
        pass
    
    def deploy_agents(self):
        # Logic to deploy and manage agents
        pass

# Self-Improvement Module
class SelfImprovingModule:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model

    def assess_and_improve(self):
        # Assess model performance and make improvements
        pass
```

#### Next Steps

1. **Testing and Iteration**:
   - Implement unit tests to validate each component’s functionality.
   - Conduct simulations to test system integration and performance under varied conditions.

2. **Integration with Existing Infrastructure**:
   - Ensure compatibility with existing components of the PTM empire’s stack.
   - Facilitate seamless data exchange and operational synchronization.

3. **Feedback and Continuous Development**:
   - Establish feedback mechanisms to foster iterative improvement.
   - Engage with end-users to gather insights and refine module functionalities. 

This high-level design emphasizes adaptability, efficiency, and scalability to ensure the PTM empire’s autonomy stack evolves and excels in dynamic environments.
