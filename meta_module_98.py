Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional or specific context-driven) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves several steps. Here, I will outline a conceptual framework, including some code snippets to demonstrate how such a system might be structured.

### Conceptual Framework

1. **Self-Evolving Autonomy Stack**:  
   This represents a computational framework capable of adapting and evolving over time without direct human intervention. It could be applied in contexts like robotic systems, autonomous vehicles, or AI-driven decision systems.

2. **Recursive Strategies**:  
   Recursion is a key strategy in this system, where functions call themselves to perform iterative operations with adaptive feedback loops. Recursive algorithms help in exploring and finding solutions by traversing potential decision paths or states.

3. **Modular Design**:  
   The module will be designed to be easily expanded with new features and improvements. It should have a clear interface for integrating new capabilities.

### Module Design

We'll build a hypothetical module named `self_evolver`. The core components will include:

- **State Representation**: Define states of the system using classes or data structures.
- **Evaluation Function**: Assess states or actions to determine the best path.
- **Recursive Exploration**: Search and optimization using recursive algorithms.
- **Adaptation and Learning**: Use machine learning techniques for adaptation based on feedback.

```python
# self_evolver.py

import random
import numpy as np

class State:
    def __init__(self, description):
        self.description = description
        self.score = 0.0

    def evaluate(self):
        # This would be your custom evaluation logic
        self.score = random.random()

class SelfEvolver:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.best_state = None

    def recursive_explore(self, current_state, depth=0, max_depth=10):
        if depth > max_depth:
            return

        current_state.evaluate()
        if self.best_state is None or current_state.score > self.best_state.score:
            self.best_state = current_state

        next_states = self.generate_possible_transitions(current_state)
        for state in next_states:
            self.recursive_explore(state, depth + 1)

    def generate_possible_transitions(self, state):
        # Generate possible next states; here, we mock it with random states
        transitions = [State(f"State derived from {state.description}") for _ in range(3)]
        return transitions

    def adapt(self):
        # Implement a machine learning based adaptation mechanism
        # Let's assume the use of a simple model to learn what makes a good state
        X = np.random.rand(10, 5)  # Features
        y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 10)  # Labels (binary classification)

        # Hypothetical machine learning model
        from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
        model = RandomForestClassifier()
        model.fit(X, y)

        # Use the model to adapt stack behavior here
        # This is highly dependent on specific needs and contexts
        predictions = model.predict(X)
        print("Adaptation cycle complete with predictions:", predictions)

    def run(self):
        initial_state = State("Initial state")
        self.recursive_explore(initial_state)
        print(f"Best State: {self.best_state.description} with score {self.best_state.score}")
        self.adapt()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    evolver = SelfEvolver()
    evolver.run()
```

### Key Features

- **State Management**: A simple class (`State`) to represent different states of the system and provides evaluation logic.
- **Recursive Exploration**: A method (`recursive_explore`) that examines different paths using recursion, adjusting according to state evaluations.
- **Adaptation Mechanism**: Uses a basic machine learning model to simulate learning and adaptation based on state evaluations.

### Extensions

- **Distributed Computing**: Implement parallel or distributed strategies for state exploration to handle large and complex state spaces.
- **Advanced Learning**: Integrate deep learning models or evolutionary algorithms for more sophisticated adaptation and learning.
- **Feedback Loops**: Incorporate real-time feedback systems to adjust strategies dynamically based on real-world or simulated outcomes.

This module can be further expanded and customized to meet the specific requirements of the PTM empire and whatever specific functionalities are needed for its self-evolving autonomy stack.
