Sure, let's create a Python utility for a strategy game designed to manage an empire's resource allocation efficiently. This utility will focus on optimizing resource distribution to three critical sectors: Military, Research, and Infrastructure. The goal is to ensure that resources are balanced to maintain a strong defense, innovate for future technologies, and develop infrastructure to support the growing needs of the empire.

We'll create a function `optimize_resources` that takes in current resource levels and sector priorities, then distributes resources accordingly. This example assumes the resources are in the form of some quantifiable unit like "points" or "credits".

```python
class EmpireManager:
    def __init__(self, resources, priorities):
        """
        Initializes the empire with resources and priorities.
        
        :param resources: Total available resources to distribute.
        :param priorities: Dictionary with sectors as keys and their priority levels (1-3) as values.
                           Priority levels must add up to 3.
        """
        self.resources = resources
        self.priorities = priorities
        self.sectors = ['Military', 'Research', 'Infrastructure']
        self.allocation = {sector: 0 for sector in self.sectors}

    def distribute_resources(self):
        """
        Distributes resources to each sector based on their priority level.
        """
        total_priority = sum(self.priorities.values())
        if total_priority != 3:
            raise ValueError("Priority levels must sum up to 3")
        
        for sector in self.sectors:
            allocated = (self.priorities[sector] / total_priority) * self.resources
            self.allocation[sector] = allocated
        
        return self.allocation

    def print_allocation_report(self):
        """
        Prints a report of the current resource allocation.
        """
        print(f"Total Resources: {self.resources}")
        for sector, allocated in self.allocation.items():
            print(f"{sector}: {allocated:.2f} resources allocated.")

def main():
    # Example usage
    resources = 1000  # Total resources available
    priorities = {'Military': 1, 'Research': 1, 'Infrastructure': 1}

    empire = EmpireManager(resources, priorities)
    allocation = empire.distribute_resources()
    empire.print_allocation_report()

    # Adjust priorities and redistribute
    print("\nAdjusting priorities...")
    empire.priorities = {'Military': 2, 'Research': 0.5, 'Infrastructure': 0.5}
    allocation = empire.distribute_resources()
    empire.print_allocation_report()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
- **EmpireManager Class**: This class manages the distribution of resources across the three sectors. It initializes with a certain amount of resources and sector priorities.
- **distribute_resources Method**: It calculates and allocates resources based on priorities. The sum of priorities must equal 3 to ensure a fair distribution.
- **print_allocation_report Method**: It generates a report of how resources have been allocated.
- **Main Function**: Demonstrates how to use the `EmpireManager` class. It initializes resources and priorities, performs resource allocation, and prints the result. It also shows how to adjust priorities and see the updated allocation.

This utility can be integrated into a larger strategy game to help manage resources effectively and ensure balanced empire growth. Feel free to customize the logic based on your game's specific mechanics!
