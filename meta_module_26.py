Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably referring to a fictional empire in your context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves both conceptual planning and practical implementation. When creating such a module, let's consider some realistic concepts like machine learning, meta-learning, and genetic algorithms that rely on recursive strategies. Below, I will outline a potential approach for designing this Python module.

### Overview
The module, named `RecursiveAutonomy`, aims to facilitate self-evolution in autonomous systems by leveraging recursive learning strategies. It integrates various machine learning techniques and allows the system to improve its capabilities over time.

### Key Components

1. **Self-Optimization with Meta-Learning:**
   - Use models that can learn to learn (meta-learning) to adapt rapidly to new tasks.
   - Deploy recursive neural networks or LSTMs for dynamic environments that require long-term dependencies.

2. **Genetic Algorithm-Based Evolution:**
   - Implement genetic algorithms that use recursive strategies to simulate evolution.
   - Include selection, crossover, and mutation processes recursively to optimize system parameters.

3. **Recursive Reinforcement Learning:**
   - Design an RL framework where agents evolve strategies over multiple recursive iterations.
   - Implement value iteration and policy gradients with recursive functions for decision-making.

4. **Self-Diagnostic and Self-Repair Mechanisms:**
   - Incorporate recursive diagnostic strategies that enable the system to monitor its performance continuously and execute self-repair protocols.

5. **Dataset Augmentation Using Recursive Synthesis:**
   - Implement a recursive data synthesis approach to expand training datasets artificially.

### Python Module Structure

Here's a conceptual design of what the module might look like:

```python
# RecursiveAutonomy/__init__.py
from .meta_learning import MetaLearner
from .genetic_evolution import GeneticOptimizer
from .reinforcement_learning import RecursiveReinforcer
from .self_diagnostics import SelfDiagnostician
from .data_synthesis import DataSynthesizer

# RecursiveAutonomy/meta_learning.py
class MetaLearner:
    def __init__(self, base_model):
        self.base_model = base_model
        
    def recursive_learn(self, tasks):
        # Implement recursive learning strategies across tasks
        pass

# RecursiveAutonomy/genetic_evolution.py
class GeneticOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, population_size):
        self.population = self.initialize_population(population_size)
        
    def evolve(self, generations):
        for _ in range(generations):
            self.selection()
            self.crossover()
            self.mutation()
    
    def selection(self):
        # Implement recursive strategy for selection
        pass

    def crossover(self):
        # Implement crossover logic
        pass
    
    def mutation(self):
        # Implement mutation logic
        pass

# RecursiveAutonomy/reinforcement_learning.py
class RecursiveReinforcer:
    def __init__(self, environment):
        self.environment = environment
        
    def train(self, episodes):
        for episode in range(episodes):
            # Implement recursive reinforcement learning strategy
            pass

# RecursiveAutonomy/self_diagnostics.py
class SelfDiagnostician:
    def __init__(self, system):
        self.system = system
        
    def diagnose_and_repair(self):
        # Implement recursive self-diagnostic and repair methods
        pass

# RecursiveAutonomy/data_synthesis.py
class DataSynthesizer:
    def __init__(self, base_data):
        self.base_data = base_data
        
    def augment_data(self):
        # Use recursive synthesis strategy to augment data
        pass

# RecursiveAutonomy/utils.py
def recursive_function_template():
    # Utility for implementing recursive strategies
    pass
```

### Implementation Details

- **Meta-Learning:** Use existing frameworks like MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) to implement recursive learning strategies that can adapt quickly.
  
- **Genetic Algorithms:** Implement recursion in mutation and crossover functions to improve exploration of the solution space.

- **Reinforcement Learning:** Recursive value iteration can help models improve decision-making by considering the long-term consequences dynamically.

- **Self-Diagnostics:** Employ recursive tree-search approaches to identify the root causes of system failures, followed by autogenous repair routines.

- **Data Synthesis:** Use recursive generative models to create realistic variations of training data.

### Testing and Validation

- Implement unit tests for each component to validate logical correctness and integration tests to ensure seamless operation of the entire module.

- Use simulation environments like OpenAI's Gym for testing the reinforcement learning strategies.

This approach aligns with modern autonomy stacks where dynamic adaptation, learning, and optimization become crucial. By incorporating recursive strategies, the system gains the ability to handle complex tasks and environments effectively.
