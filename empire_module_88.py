Creating an advanced Python module for a hypothetical "unstoppable PTM (Predictive Text Module) empire" can be both an exciting and challenging task. Such a module could involve complex algorithms, recursion, and perhaps some artificial intelligence or machine learning components to enhance text prediction capabilities. Below, I'll provide you with a conceptual framework and sample code for such a module, focusing on intelligent recursion and text prediction enhancements.

```python
# advanced_ptm.py

import random
from collections import defaultdict

class AdvancedPTM:
    def __init__(self, depth=3):
        self.model = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
        self.depth = depth

    def train(self, text):
        """Train the model with given text. Analyzes sequences up to a specified depth."""
        words = text.split()
        for i in range(len(words) - self.depth):
            key = tuple(words[i:i + self.depth])
            next_word = words[i + self.depth]
            self.model[key][next_word] += 1

    def predict(self, seed, num_words=10):
        """Predicts the next words based on a seed using intelligent recursion."""
        current_sequence = tuple(seed.split()[:self.depth])
        prediction = list(current_sequence)

        for _ in range(num_words):
            next_word = self._get_next_word_recursively(current_sequence)
            if not next_word:
                break
            prediction.append(next_word)
            current_sequence = tuple(prediction[-self.depth:])

        return ' '.join(prediction)

    def _get_next_word_recursively(self, sequence, recursion_depth=0):
        """Recursively attempts to find the next word for a given word sequence."""
        if recursion_depth > self.depth:
            return None

        candidates = self.model[sequence]
        if candidates:
            # Choose the next word probabilistically based on counts
            total = sum(candidates.values())
            rand_choice = random.uniform(0, total)
            cumulative = 0
            for word, count in candidates.items():
                cumulative += count
                if rand_choice <= cumulative:
                    return word

        # If no candidates, reduce the sequence length recursively
        return self._get_next_word_recursively(sequence[1:], recursion_depth + 1)

# Example usage (not part of the module):
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ptm = AdvancedPTM(depth=3)
    example_text = (
        "This is an example text for the PTM module. "
        "The PTM empire uses recursion intelligently. "
        "The recursive approach improves predictive accuracy. "
    )
    ptm.train(example_text)

    seed_text = "The PTM"
    print(ptm.predict(seed_text, num_words=10))
```

### Key Features of the Module:

1. **Markov Chain-Based Prediction**: The module uses a Markov chain-like approach where it builds a model based on sequences of words up to a specified `depth`.

2. **Intelligent Recursion**: If a prediction cannot be made, the module recursively shortens the sequence until it finds a prediction or reaches the base case, enhancing its ability to handle sparse data.

3. **Probabilistic Word Selection**: It uses a probabilistic approach weighted by the frequency of words to make predictions more realistic.

4. **Configurable Depth**: The depth of analysis can be configured, allowing users to balance between prediction granularity and computation cost.

This module provides basic predictive text functionality and demonstrates an intelligent application of recursion. For a production-level system, you might want to further optimize the structure and possibly integrate machine learning models for even more sophisticated text predictions.
