Creating an advanced Python module that leverages intelligent recursion requires designing a recursive strategy that optimizes either by reducing time complexity or efficiently using resources. Below, I'll outline a module with an intelligent recursive approach that utilizes memoization to optimize recursive calls. This will be a custom module for a fictional concept within the "PTM empire."

Let's imagine PTM stands for "Prime Transformation Model," and the task of the module is to compute the prime permutations of a given number intelligently. Our module will include intelligent recursion by using memoization, which helps avoid redundant calculations, especially for expensive recursive operations.

```python
# prime_transform.py

from collections import defaultdict
from itertools import permutations

class PrimeTransformationModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memo = {}
        
    def is_prime(self, n):
        """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        if n <= 3:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True

    def prime_permutations(self, n):
        """Calculate all unique prime permutations of a number."""
        str_n = str(n)
        perms = set(int(''.join(p)) for p in permutations(str_n))
        prime_perms = [p for p in perms if self.is_prime(p)]
        return prime_perms

    def intelligent_recursion(self, n):
        """
        An intelligently recursive function to find all prime permutations.
        
        Uses memoization to store already computed results for numbers,
        avoiding redundant calculations.
        """
        if n in self.memo:
            return self.memo[n]

        prime_perms = self.prime_permutations(n)

        # Store the result in memo
        self.memo[n] = prime_perms
        return prime_perms

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ptm = PrimeTransformationModel()
    number = 137
    prime_perms = ptm.intelligent_recursion(number)
    print(f"Prime permutations of {number}: {prime_perms}")
```

### Explanation

1. **Prime Check Function**: The function `is_prime()` checks if a given number `n` is prime. It uses a basic method that's optimized to reduce the number of checks.

2. **Permutations and Filtering**: The function `prime_permutations()` generates all permutations of the digits of `n` and then filters those permutations to find prime numbers.

3. **Memoization in Recursion**: The core here is the `intelligent_recursion()` method, which uses memoization. The computed permutations for each number are stored in a dictionary (`self.memo`). If a number has already been computed, we return the stored result, avoiding redundant calculations.

4. **Example Usage**: The example at the bottom demonstrates how to create an instance of `PrimeTransformationModel` and use it to find prime permutations of a number.

This approach ensures that calculations are not repeated unnecessarily, making the recursive calls intelligent by leveraging memoization. Depending on PTM's specific needs, such a framework can be adapted to more complex transformations and models.
