Designing an innovative Python module for the PTM (Presumably A Theoretical Model) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves leveraging recursive strategies to enhance autonomy in decision-making, optimization, and adaptability. Let's break down a conceptual design for such a module.

### Module Overview

The module, let's call it `AutonomyEnhancer`, leverages recursive strategies such as recursive neural networks, recursive optimization techniques, and recursive decision-making algorithms to evolve autonomously over time. The primary purpose is to allow the PTM system to adapt to new environments, optimize performance, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

### Key Components of the Module

1. **Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs)**:
   - Use RNNs to process dynamic sequences of input data for continual learning.
   - Implement Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to maintain information over long temporal sequences.

2. **Recursive Optimization**:
   - Develop a recursive optimization algorithm to improve system parameters iteratively.
   - Leverage gradient descent and other advanced optimization techniques that recursively update model weights.

3. **Recursive Decision-Making**:
   - Implement decision trees with recursive decision-making capabilities to navigate complex environments.
   - Use feedback loops to refine and improve decision quality over iterations.

4. **Environment Interaction**:
   - Build an interface for interacting with environments, enabling the module to receive input, act, and adapt.
   - Use reinforcement learning paradigms where an agent recursively learns from consequences of actions.

5. **Evolving Knowledge Base**:
   - Create a dynamic knowledge base that updates itself using recursive queries and data structures.
   - Incorporate ontologies that adapt over time, recognizing new patterns and augmenting existing knowledge.

```python
# AutonomyEnhancer.py

import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
import logging

class AutonomyEnhancer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = self._build_recursive_nn()
        self.decision_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier()

    def _build_recursive_nn()::
        """Builds a simple LSTM-based recursive neural network."""
        model = Sequential()
        model.add(LSTM(128, input_shape=input_shape, return_sequences=True))
        model.add(LSTM(64))
        model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
        return model

    def recursive_optimize(self, X_train, y_train, epochs=10):
        """Recursively train the neural network."""
        for epoch in range(epochs):
            logging.info(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}")
            self.model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=1, batch_size=32, verbose=1)

    def make_recursive_decision(self, context):
        """Make decisions recursively based on provided context."""
        return self.decision_tree.predict(context)

    def evolve(self, X, y):
        """Continual evolution process."""
        self.recursive_optimize(X, y)
        self.decision_tree.fit(X, y)
        self.update_knowledge_base(X, y)

    def update_knowledge_base(self, X, y):
        """Recursively update the knowledge base."""
        logging.info("Updating the knowledge base with new information.")
        # This can be expanded depending on domain knowledge and specifics.
    
    def interact_with_environment(self, environment):
        """Interact with the given environment and update module accordingly."""
        state = environment.observe()
        decision = self.make_recursive_decision(state)
        next_state, reward, done = environment.act(decision)
        self.evolve(next_state, reward)

def main():
    autonomy_module = AutonomyEnhancer()
    # Dummy environment interaction logic
    # environment = SomeEnvSimulation()
    # autonomy_module.interact_with_environment(environment)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Summary

The `AutonomyEnhancer` module provides a flexible and robust foundation to expand the self-evolving autonomy stack of the PTM empire. Each component is designed to recursively enhance capabilities, resulting in improved decision-making, adaptation to new environments, and continual learning, crucial for any autonomous system aiming for long-term success and innovation. Adjustments and expansions can be integrated based on evolving requirements and technological advancements.
