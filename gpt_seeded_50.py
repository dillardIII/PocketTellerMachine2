Creating a new Python utility for strategy or empire games can enhance the gameplay experience by automating mundane tasks, providing strategic advice, or improving in-game decision-making processes. Let's create a Python utility called "Empire Advisor" that provides strategic recommendations based on a playerâ€™s current assets and objectives. This utility will utilize simple heuristics to suggest optimal actions for resource allocation, expansion, and defense.

```python
import random

class EmpireAdvisor:
    def __init__(self, resources, territories, military_strength):
        self.resources = resources
        self.territories = territories
        self.military_strength = military_strength
        self.resource_thresholds = {
            'expansion': 1000,
            'defense': 500,
            'research': 300
        }

    def evaluate_expansion(self):
        if self.resources > self.resource_thresholds['expansion']:
            target_territory = self.choose_target_territory()
            print(f"Advisory: Expand into {target_territory}. Ensure you have enough defense.")
        else:
            print("Advisory: Accumulate more resources to expand.")

    def choose_target_territory(self):
        # A very basic AI that selects a random adjacent territory for expansion
        return random.choice(["North Territory", "South Territory", "East Territory", "West Territory"])

    def evaluate_defense(self):
        if self.territories > 5 and self.military_strength < self.resources / 2:
            print("Advisory: Strengthen your defenses with more military units.")
        else:
            print("Advisory: Your defense is currently adequate.")

    def evaluate_research(self):
        if self.resources > self.resource_thresholds['research']:
            print("Advisory: Invest in research to advance technology and improve efficiency.")
        else:
            print("Advisory: Limited resources for research, prioritize other areas.")

    def provide_strategic_advice(self):
        print("\n---- Empire Strategic Advisory ----\n")
        self.evaluate_expansion()
        self.evaluate_defense()
        self.evaluate_research()
        print("\n-----------------------------------\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example empire state, easily adjustable for different scenarios
    current_resources = 1200
    current_territories = 6
    current_military_strength = 400

    advisor = EmpireAdvisor(
        resources=current_resources,
        territories=current_territories,
        military_strength=current_military_strength
    )

    advisor.provide_strategic_advice()
```

### Features of "Empire Advisor":

1. **Resource Evaluation**:
   - Determines if the empire has enough resources for expansion, military reinforcement, or research.:
:
2. **Target Territory Selection**:
   - For expansion, the utility selects a random adjacent territory, simulating a simplified strategic decision.

3. **Defensive Measures**:
   - Provides advice on whether the empire's military strength is sufficient relative to the number of territories owned.

4. **Research Investment**:
   - Suggests investing in research if resources exceed a certain threshold.:
:
This utility provides a basic framework to issue strategic advice based on predefined heuristic rules. To improve this advisor, you could integrate more complex decision algorithms or data-driven strategies by analyzing past gameplay statistics or utilizing machine learning for adaptive advice.
