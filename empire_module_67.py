Creating an advanced Python module that demonstrates intelligent recursion requires a careful combination of advanced recursion techniques, efficiency improvements, and adaptability to various problem types. Here's a conceptual example of such a module:

```python
# intelligent_recursion.py
"""
An advanced Python module for intelligent recursion.
This module provides algorithms and utilities to solve problems using smart recursive strategies.
"""

from functools import lru_cache

class IntelligentRecursion:
    """
    A class containing methods to solve problems using intelligent recursion.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def fibonacci(self, n):
        """
        Calculate the n-th Fibonacci number using intelligent recursion with memoization.
        """
        if n < 2:
            return n
        return self.fibonacci(n - 1) + self.fibonacci(n - 2)

    def tower_of_hanoi(self, n, source, target, auxiliary):
        """
        Solve Towers of Hanoi problem using intelligent recursion.
        """
        if n > 0:
            self.tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)
            print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}.")
            self.tower_of_hanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)

    def merge_sort(self, array):
        """
        Perform a merge sort using intelligent recursion.
        """
        if len(array) <= 1:
            return array

        mid = len(array) // 2
        left_half = self.merge_sort(array[:mid])
        right_half = self.merge_sort(array[mid:])

        return self._merge(left_half, right_half)

    def _merge(self, left, right):
        """
        Merge two sorted lists.
        """
        result = []
        while left and right:
            if left[0] < right[0]:
                result.append(left.pop(0))
            else:
                result.append(right.pop(0))

        result.extend(left or right)
        return result

    def knapsack(self, capacity, weights, values, n=None):
        """
        Solve the knapsack problem using intelligent recursion with memoization.
        """
        if n is None:
            n = len(weights)

        if capacity == 0 or n == 0:
            return 0

        # Base case: If weight of the nth item is more than the capacity W
        if weights[n-1] > capacity:
            return self.knapsack(capacity, weights, values, n-1)

        # Return the maximum of two cases:
        # (1) nth item included
        # (2) not included
        return max(
            values[n-1] + self.knapsack(capacity - weights[n-1], weights, values, n-1),
            self.knapsack(capacity, weights, values, n-1)
        )


# Example Usage:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    recursion = IntelligentRecursion()

    # Example 1: Fibonacci
    print("Fibonacci Number:", recursion.fibonacci(10))

    # Example 2: Towers of Hanoi
    recursion.tower_of_hanoi(3, 'A', 'C', 'B')

    # Example 3: Merge Sort
    array = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]
    sorted_array = recursion.merge_sort(array)
    print("Sorted Array:", sorted_array)

    # Example 4: Knapsack Problem
    weights = [10, 20, 30]
    values = [60, 100, 120]
    capacity = 50
    print("Knapsack Value:", recursion.knapsack(capacity, weights, values))
```

### Key Features:
1. **Memoization:** Utilizing `lru_cache` for Fibonacci to improve recursive efficiency by avoiding redundant calculations.
2. **Parameter Passing:** Flexibility in recursive calls such as in Towers of Hanoi and merge sort.
3. **Tailor-made Recursion:** Each function adapts recursive strategies for distinct problem types while ensuring clarity and maintainability.
4. **Comprehensive Examples:** Provides real-world examples where intelligent recursion is beneficial. 

You can expand this module further by incorporating more advanced recursive algorithms and optimizing current ones as needed.
