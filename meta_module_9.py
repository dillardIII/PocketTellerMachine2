Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical entity related to autonomous systems) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can adapt, learn, and optimize its operations recursively. The focus on "recursive strategies" suggests that the module should be able to iteratively improve upon its capabilities, using feedback mechanisms and possibly leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, or evolutionary algorithms.

Below is a high-level outline for how such a Python module could be structured.

### Python Module: PTMRecursiveAutonomy

#### 1. Module Structure

```plaintext
PTMRecursiveAutonomy/
|-- __init__.py
|-- core/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- autonomous_agent.py
|   |-- environment.py
|-- strategies/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- learning.py
|   |-- optimization.py
|   |-- evolution.py
|-- utils/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- data_handler.py
|   |-- logger.py
```

#### 2. Core Components

- **Autonomous Agent (`autonomous_agent.py`):**
  - Define a class `AutonomousAgent` which serves as the primary interface for the system. This could have methods like `observe()`, `act()`, and `learn()` to interact with the environment and update its internal models.

- **Environment (`environment.py`):**
  - A class `Environment` to simulate the operational context. This could include a variety of scenarios to test and evolve the agent's capabilities.

#### 3. Strategy Implementations

- **Learning (`learning.py`):**
  - Implement deep learning techniques utilizing libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Develop recursive learning algorithms allowing for self-improvement from experiences.
  - Introduce techniques like Transfer Learning and Meta-Learning to adapt existing knowledge to new tasks rapidly.

- **Optimization (`optimization.py`):**
  - Include evolutionary strategies like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) or Genetic Algorithms (GA) to explore a diverse set of solutions.
  - Implement reinforcement learning strategies to optimize the decision-making process by rewarding effective outcomes.

- **Evolution (`evolution.py`):**
  - Design a recursive evolution model where agents can clone successful strategies with mutation and crossover mechanisms for continuous self-improvement.
  - Leverage multi-agent systems to promote collaborative learning and shared experiences across agents.

#### 4. Utilities

- **Data Handler (`data_handler.py`):**
  - Provide tools for managing training data, simulation logs, and model checkpoints for iterative improvements.

- **Logger (`logger.py`):**
  - Implement a logging utility to record agent performance, decision outcomes, and environmental changes for analysis and debugging.

#### 5. Recursive Strategies

Implement recursive methodologies within the relevant components:

- **Recursive Self-Improvement:**
  - Allow agents to evaluate their performance over time and make adjustments to their internal models or strategies autonomously.
  - Use feedback loops where output informs future input adjustments, driving a cycle of continuous improvement.

- **Hierarchical Learning:**
  - Create multi-level learning strategies where higher-level models guide the augmentation of lower-level heuristics and vice versa.

- **Adaptive Optimization:**
  - Design systems that dynamically alter their optimization strategies based on performance feedback or environmental changes, enabling quick adaptation to new challenges.

#### 6. Example Usage

```python
from PTMRecursiveAutonomy.core.autonomous_agent import AutonomousAgent
from PTMRecursiveAutonomy.core.environment import Environment
from PTMRecursiveAutonomy.strategies.learning import deep_learning_strategy

# Initialize environment and agent
env = Environment(config)
agent = AutonomousAgent(strategy=deep_learning_strategy)

# Main loop
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = agent.act(state)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        agent.learn(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        state = next_state

    # Optional: recursive improvement after each episode
    agent.self_improve()

```

### Considerations
- **Scalability:** Ensure the module is scalable and can handle various complex environments.
- **Testability:** Create unit tests for each component to ensure reliability.
- **Security:** Implement security measures to protect the autonomy stack from malicious inputs or unexpected failures.

This module provides a baseline that can be expanded with more sophisticated models and strategies as the PTM empire's needs evolve.
