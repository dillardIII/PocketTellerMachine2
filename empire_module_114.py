Creating an advanced Python module with "intelligent recursion" for the fictional "unstoppable PTM empire" can touch upon various programming concepts, such as optimization techniques, recursion in data structures, or even simulating complex systems. Below, I'll outline a Python module that implements an advanced recursive algorithm with intelligent features for optimizing performance, such as memoization and custom data handling strategies. This module will demonstrate recursive solutions for solving a generic problem, which can be adapted based on specific needs.

    # Example to demonstrate the usage of intelligent recursion
    ptm = IntelligentRecursion()

    # Fibonacci example
    print(f"10th Fibonacci number: {ptm.fibonacci(10)}")

    # Knapsack example
    weights = [10, 20, 30]
    values = [60, 100, 120]

### Explanation
- **Fibonacci with Memoization**: Uses Python's `functools.lru_cache()` to automatically cache previously computed Fibonacci numbers, reducing redundant calculations drastically.

- **0/1 Knapsack with Memoization**: Illustrates how a classic dynamic programming problem can be implemented using recursion combined with memoization to store results of sub-problems. The cache is manually handled via a dictionary `self.memo_cache`.

- **Intelligent Features**:
  - **Memoization**: Key for optimizing recursive calls by caching results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
  - **Clear Cache Functionality**: Allows clearing memoization cache, ensuring memory can be managed efficiently in long-running applications.

This module can be expanded with additional algorithms or integrated into larger systems as part of the PTM empire's library, delivering recursive solutions and optimization techniques.
