Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional organization in this context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating an architecture that can continuously improve through recursive strategies. Below is a conceptual outline for such a Python module, which we can call `RecursiveAutonomy`. This module aims to enhance autonomy by leveraging machine learning, specifically recursive neural networks, self-reinforcement learning, and meta-learning strategies.

### RecursiveAutonomy Module Structure

#### Key Components

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**
   - A submodule to gather and preprocess the necessary data from various sources. This should be designed to continuously update and enhance the data quality via feedback loops.

2. **Core Autonomy Engine**
   - A main driver for executing the core tasks. It employs a recursive neural network (RNN) to handle sequential data that could represent the states and actions of the network.

3. **Self-Optimization**
   - Uses reinforcement learning (RL) techniques that allow the system to self-optimize by learning policies for each function.

4. **Meta-Learning Strategies**
   - A component that implements meta-learning (learning to learn), allowing the system to quickly adapt to new tasks by learning parameters that aid in faster convergence of models.

5. **Feedback Loop System**
   - An intrinsic loop mechanism that evaluates performance, retrieves feedback from various stages, and updates the model accordingly.

6. **Diagnostics & Analytics**
   - Log and analyze performance metrics for tracking improvements and stability of the autonomy stack.

7. **API Interface**
   - An API to interface with other systems, allowing integration and interoperability with existing solutions.

### Implementation Sketch

```python
# RecursiveAutonomy/__init__.py

from .data_preprocessing import DataAcquisition
from .core_engine import CoreAutonomyEngine
from .self_optimization import ReinforcementLearner
from .meta_learning import MetaLearner
from .feedback_system import FeedbackSystem
from .analytics import Diagnostics
from .api_interface import APIInterface

class RecursiveAutonomy:
    def __init__(self):        
        self.data_acquisition = DataAcquisition()
        self.core_engine = CoreAutonomyEngine()
        self.reinforcement_learner = ReinforcementLearner(self.core_engine)
        self.meta_learner = MetaLearner()
        self.feedback_system = FeedbackSystem(self.reinforcement_learner, self.meta_learner)
        self.diagnostics = Diagnostics()
        self.api_interface = APIInterface()
    
    def update_autonomy(self):
        # Collect new data
        new_data = self.data_acquisition.collect_data()
        
        # Preprocess data
        processed_data = self.data_acquisition.preprocess(new_data)
        
        # Train main autonomy engine
        performance = self.core_engine.train(processed_data)
        
        # Self-optimize using reinforcement learning
        self.reinforcement_learner.optimize()
        
        # Implement meta-learning for adaptability
        self.meta_learner.adapt(performance)
        
        # Update system based on feedback
        self.feedback_system.update_models()
        
        # Run diagnostics and log metrics
        self.diagnostics.log_metrics()
        
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.update_autonomy()

# Sample submodules would be defined in their respective files such as
# data_preprocessing.py, core_engine.py, etc. Each would implement the appropriate methods.
```

### RecursiveAutonomy Strategies

- **Recursive Feedback Loops**: Use feedback mechanisms not only for immediate corrections but for long-term trend analysis, allowing the system to evolve over time.
  
- **Hierarchical Learning**: Build multiple layers of abstraction within the autonomy stack. Each layer learns not only from data but also interprets the outputs of preceding layers.

- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Adaptively allocate computational resources depending on the current learning phase or task, maximizing efficiency.

- **Adaptive Learning Rates**: Implement strategies that adjust learning rates based on the model's performance trends.

This design represents a flexible, continually evolving architecture focused on recursive improvements. It will enable the PTM empire's system to become more autonomous, adaptive, and capable of solving increasingly complex tasks over time.
