Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably referring to a fictional empire) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires considering several key components such as recursive strategies, modular architecture, machine learning, and self-optimization mechanisms. Below is an outline and conceptual design of such a module:

### Module Overview

The module, named `ptm_autonomy`, aims to enhance system autonomy using recursive strategies and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. This module focuses on self-evolution, allowing the system to dynamically adapt and improve its operations.

### Key Features

1. **Recursive Learning**: Implement recursive learning techniques to continually refine the autonomy stack.
2. **Self-Optimization**: Incorporate self-optimization algorithms that adjust parameters and strategies based on performance metrics.
3. **Modular Architecture**: Design the module with a modular architecture to ensure easily extensible components.
4. **Real-Time Data Processing**: Enable real-time processing and decision-making capabilities.
5. **Integration API**: Provide APIs for seamless integration with existing PTM systems and external data sources.

### Module Components

1. **Data Acquisition Layer**:
   - `DataCollector`: Interfaces with various sensors and data sources to gather necessary information.
   - `Preprocessor`: Cleans and preprocesses data for further analysis.

2. **Learning Core**:
   - `RecursiveLearner`: Implements recursive learning algorithms, e.g., Recursive Least Squares, Self-Organizing Maps, or Recursive Neural Networks.
   - `AnomalyDetector`: Identifies and adjusts for anomalies in the data, improving reliability and accuracy.
   - `Optimizer`: Utilizes reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms for continuous self-optimization.

3. **Decision Engine**:
   - `StrategyGenerator`: Develops and refines strategies based on learned patterns and optimization goals.
   - `Simulator`: Simulates potential outcomes of different strategies in a virtual environment before deployment.

4. **Control Interface**:
   - `ControlManager`: Provides APIs for managing system autonomy and interacting with PTM's existing systems.
   - `Dashboard`: Visualizes performance metrics, learning progress, and system health.

### Innovative Recursive Strategies

- **Hierarchical Recursive Strategy**: Implement a multi-level recursive learning approach where higher-level decision-making processes are informed by lower-level insights, enabling more strategic autonomy.
  
- **Adaptive Recursive Networks**: Use adaptive recursive neural networks (RNNs) that evolve their architecture and parameters based on feedback loops, optimizing the processing of temporally dependent data.

- **Self-Reflective Learning**: Introduce a self-reflective feedback mechanism where the system periodically assesses its performance and adjusts its learning targets dynamically.

### Example Implementation

```python
# ptm_autonomy/core.py

class DataCollector:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialization code for data sources
        pass
    
    def collect(self):
        # Collect data from various sources
        pass

class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize recursive learning algorithms
        pass
    
    def update_model(self, data):
        # Update learning model recursively
        pass

class Optimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        # Setup optimization parameters
        pass
    
    def optimize(self, strategy):
        # Optimize given strategy using self-optimization algorithms
        pass

class ControlManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize control interfaces
        pass
    
    def execute(self, strategy):
        # Execute the chosen strategy
        pass

# Example of a recursive learning method
class RecursiveLeastSquares(RecursiveLearner):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Initialize RLS parameters
        
    def update_model(self, data):
        # Recursive update procedure
        pass

# Future additions could include more specialized recursive models and strategies.
```

### Development Considerations

- **Scalability**: Ensure that the module is scalable to handle large datasets and numerous integrations.
- **Security**: Implement robust security measures to protect data integrity and system operations.
- **Testing & Validation**: Conduct thorough testing and validation to ensure reliability and accuracy across different scenarios.

This design is intended as a starting point for developing a highly adaptive and intelligent autonomy stack for the PTM empire. The architecture is flexible enough to incorporate future advancements and technologies as required.
