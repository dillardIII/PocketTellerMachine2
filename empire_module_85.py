Creating an advanced Python module with intelligent recursion involves understanding the task at hand and designing a solution that leverages recursion effectively. Let's create a sample Python module called `ptm_recursion` that includes a class to solve complex problems using intelligent recursion strategies. For demonstration purposes, I'll define a module that includes a method to solve the n-Queens problem using recursion and backtracking. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can showcase the power of recursion.

### ptm_recursion.py

```python
# ptm_recursion.py

from typing import List

class PTMRecursion:
    """
    A class to represent the problem-solving techniques for the PTM empire
    using intelligent recursion.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        # Here we can initialize any attributes if needed in the future
        pass

    def solve_n_queens(self, n: int) -> List[List[str]]:
        """
        Solve the n-Queens problem using intelligent recursion and return all solutions.
        
        :param n: Number of queens/size of the chessboard.
        :return: A list of solutions, where each solution is a list of strings
                 representing the board configuration.
        """
        def is_valid(board: List[str], row: int, col: int) -> bool:
            # Check if placing a queen on board[row][col] is valid
            for i in range(row):
                if board[i][col] == 'Q':
                    return False
                if col - (row - i) >= 0 and board[i][col - (row - i)] == 'Q':
                    return False
                if col + (row - i) < n and board[i][col + (row - i)] == 'Q':
                    return False
            return True

        def place_queens(row: int):
            if row == n:
                result.append([''.join(row) for row in board])
                return
            
            for col in range(n):
                if is_valid(board, row, col):
                    board[row][col] = 'Q'
                    place_queens(row + 1)
                    board[row][col] = '.'
        
        result = []
        board = [['.' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
        place_queens(0)
        return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    ptm_solver = PTMRecursion()
    solutions = ptm_solver.solve_n_queens(8)
    print(f"Total solutions for 8-Queens: {len(solutions)}")
    for solution in solutions:
        for row in solution:
            print(row)
        print()
```

### Explanation:

- **PTMRecursion Class**: This class is designed to encapsulate recursive methods that solve problems like n-Queens.

- **solve_n_queens Method**: Solves the n-Queens problem by recursively placing queens on the board and backtracking when a configuration isn't valid.
  
- **is_valid Function**: Checks whether a queen can be placed on the board at a given position without conflicts.

- **place_queens Function**: Recursively attempts to place queens on the board, backtracking whenever a placement leads to no valid solutions.

- **Result Format**: Each solution is a list of strings representing the board configuration, where 'Q' represents a queen and '.' represents an empty space.

This sample module demonstrates intelligent recursion by utilizing backtracking to explore possible solutions efficiently. Such techniques can be generalized and extended to other complex problems within the so-called PTM Empire.
