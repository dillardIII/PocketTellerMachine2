Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical organization in this context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a nuanced approach that integrates advanced machine learning, artificial intelligence techniques, and novel strategies. Below is a structured outline for such a module, emphasizing innovation and sustainability.

### Module Overview
The new module, `self_evolver`, will serve as an advanced addition to PTM's autonomy stack, focusing on self-evolution through machine learning-driven adaptability, multi-agent collaboration, and sustainable decision-making processes.

```python
# self_evolver.py

import numpy as np
import random
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

# Constants
ADAPTATION_THRESHOLD = 0.8
LEARNING_RATE = 0.01

class AutonomyAgent:
    def __init__(self, id, initial_state, environment_model):
        self.id = id
        self.state = initial_state
        self.environment_model = environment_model
        self.neural_net = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(50, 50),
                                       learning_rate_init=LEARNING_RATE)
        self.memory = []
        self.adaptation_score = 1.0

    def perceive_environment(self):
        # Gather data from the environment
        environment_data = self.environment_model.get_data()
        self.memory.append(environment_data)
        if len(self.memory) > 100:
            self.memory.pop(0)  # Maintain a maximum memory size

    def update_state(self):
        # Update agent state based on neural network predictions
        prediction = self.neural_net.predict([self.state])
        self.state = prediction[0]

    def adapt(self):
        # Self-adaptation mechanism
        if self.adaptation_score < ADAPTATION_THRESHOLD:
            print(f"Agent {self.id} is adapting its strategy.")
            self.neural_net.partial_fit([self.state],
                                        [self.environment_model.optimal_response(self.state)])
            self.adaptation_score = 1.0

    def collaborate(self, other_agents):
        # Strategy for collaboration using environment clustering
        environment_snapshot = np.array([agent.state for agent in other_agents])
        clusters = KMeans(n_clusters=int(len(other_agents) / 5))
        clusters.fit(environment_snapshot)
        nearest_agents = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=3).fit(environment_snapshot)
        for agent in other_agents:
            distances, indices = nearest_agents.kneighbors([agent.state])
            for index in indices[0]:
                if index != agent.id:
                    # Exchange relevant state data and adaptively evolve
                    agent_collab_data = other_agents[index].state
                    self.neural_net.partial_fit([self.state, agent_collab_data],
                                                [self.environment_model.optimal_response(self.state)])

    def evaluate_adaptation(self):
        # Evaluate the success of adaptation
        new_score = random.uniform(0, 1)  # Placeholder for a real evaluation metric
        self.adaptation_score = new_score


class EnvironmentModel:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the environmental parameters
        self.data = np.random.rand(100, 10)  # Sample random environment data

    def get_data(self):
        # Retrieves current environment data
        return np.mean(self.data, axis=0)

    def optimal_response(self, agent_state):
        # Placeholder for calculating the optimal response
        return np.mean(agent_state) + np.random.normal(0, 0.1)  # Arbitrary function


class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = []
        self.environment_model = EnvironmentModel()

    def initialize_agents(self, num_agents):
        for i in range(num_agents):
            initial_state = np.random.rand(10)
            agent = AutonomyAgent(i, initial_state, self.environment_model)
            self.agents.append(agent)

    def evolve(self):
        for agent in self.agents:
            agent.perceive_environment()
            agent.update_state()
            agent.evaluate_adaptation()
            agent.adapt()
            agent.collaborate(self.agents)


# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    stack = AutonomyStack()
    stack.initialize_agents(10)
    for _ in range(100):
        stack.evolve()
```

### Innovative Strategies
1. **Self-Adaptation Mechanism**: Employs dynamic learning rate adjustments and partial fitting of neural networks to adapt to environmental changes.
2. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Implements clustering and nearest neighbor algorithms for agents to interact and enhance learning experiences.
3. **Sustainability and Efficiency**: Agents use a limited memory size and adaptive evaluation metrics, making the module efficient for long-term operation.

### Future Enhancements
- Integrate reinforcement learning for more complex decision-making.
- Develop a graphical dashboard for real-time monitoring and visualization of agent states.
- Implement secure communication protocols amongst agents to ensure data integrity.

This structure provides a basis for PTM's expanded autonomy stack and can be further enhanced as technological needs evolve.
