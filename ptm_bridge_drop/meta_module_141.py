Creating a new Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably a fictional or new organization) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves designing a system that can iteratively improve itself through recursive strategies. This can involve several components like machine learning models, autonomous agents, and optimization algorithms. Hereâ€™s an outline and some code snippets to give you an idea of how you might approach this.

### Module Structure

Let's call our module `autonomous_stack`. The key components could be:

1. **Agent Class**: A base class for creating autonomous agents.
2. **Learning Module**: A component that enables recursive learning and improvement.
3. **Environment Interface**: For interacting with different environments.
4. **Recursive Strategy Engine**: Core part of the stack for recursive strategy evaluation and progression.

```python
# autonomous_stack/__init__.py
from .agent import Agent
from .learning import RecursiveLearner
from .environment import Environment
from .strategy import StrategyEngine
```

### Agent Class

The agent will have capabilities to interact with the environment and improve its strategies over time.

```python
# autonomous_stack/agent.py

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name, strategy_engine):
        self.name = name
        self.strategy_engine = strategy_engine
    
    def perceive(self, environment):
        return environment.get_state()
    
    def act(self, state):
        action = self.strategy_engine.decide(state)
        return action
    
    def learn(self, feedback):
        self.strategy_engine.update(feedback)
        
    def evolve(self):
        # Mechanism to improve agent's strategy
        new_strategies = self.strategy_engine.generate_new_strategies()
        self.strategy_engine.select_best(new_strategies)
```

### Learning Module

Recursive learning mechanism that helps the agent improve automatically.

```python
# autonomous_stack/learning.py

class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
    
    def train(self, data):
        self.model.fit(data)

    def recursive_improvement(self, data):
        # Logic for recursively improving the model
        self.train(data)
        for _ in range(10): # Arbitrary recursion limit
            self.model = self.refine_model(self.model)
            self.train(data)
    
    def refine_model(self, model):
        # Logic to tweak model parameters or architecture
        # This could involve hyperparameter tuning, etc.
        return model
```

### Environment Interface

A generic interface to allow easy interaction with varied environments. 

```python
# autonomous_stack/environment.py

class Environment:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize environment
        pass
    
    def get_state(self):
        # Return the current state of the environment
        pass
    
    def feedback(self, action):
        # Return feedback based on action
        pass
```

### Recursive Strategy Engine

The engine that evaluates and refine strategies recursively.

```python
# autonomous_stack/strategy.py

class StrategyEngine:
    def __init__(self, initial_strategies):
        self.strategies = initial_strategies
    
    def decide(self, state):
        # Logic for selecting the best strategy based on the state
        return self.strategies[0]  # Placeholder, should implement a choice mechanism
    
    def update(self, feedback):
        # Modify strategies based on feedback
        pass
    
    def generate_new_strategies(self):
        # Create new iterations of strategies, could involve genetic algorithms, etc.
        new_strategies = []
        # Implementation of strategy evolution
        return new_strategies
    
    def select_best(self, strategies):
        # Select best strategy based on some criteria
        self.strategies = strategies[:1]  # Simplified, actual implementation should properly evaluate
```

### Putting It All Together

Finally, you can write code to instantiate and run an agent in its environment:

```python
# main.py

from autonomous_stack import Agent, RecursiveLearner, Environment, StrategyEngine

# Initialize components
env = Environment()
strategy_engine = StrategyEngine(initial_strategies=["strategy1", "strategy2"])
agent = Agent(name="Explorer", strategy_engine=strategy_engine)

# Run the agent
for _ in range(100):  # Run for a certain number of iterations
    state = agent.perceive(env)
    action = agent.act(state)
    feedback = env.feedback(action)
    agent.learn(feedback)
    agent.evolve()  # Allow the agent to evolve its strategies
```

### Enhancements and Innovations

1. **Recursive Self-Learning**: You can incorporate meta-learning strategies for the model to change its learning strategy based on success rates.
2. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Expand the agent system to include cooperation/competition between multiple agents to foster more robust learning.
3. **Adaptive Environments**: Allow environments to change or evolve, offering agents novel challenges requiring dynamic adaptations.
4. **Application of RL**: Implement deep reinforcement learning algorithms for more complex strategy discovery and optimization.

This module is a high-level design, and in practice, it would need significant detail and testing, particularly around strategy evaluation, model selection, and the specific feedback loop you create.
