Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably an acronym related to an autonomous system or organization) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a careful blend of innovative recursive strategies, modularity, and adaptability. Hereâ€™s an outline and a basic implementation idea for such a module, focusing on core principles like self-optimization, learning, and adaptability. This module, let's call it `AutonomyEvolver`, will emphasize recursive strategies for learning and decision-making.

### Module Overview: `AutonomyEvolver`

#### Key Components:
1. **Recursive Learning Agent**: Implement a self-optimizing loop that iterates over decision outcomes to refine strategies.
2. **Adaptive Knowledge Base**: Maintain a dynamic repository of learned strategies and outcomes.
3. **Self-diagnosis Toolkit**: Identify inefficiencies or failures and adaptively redesign its learning pathways.
4. **Simulation Environment**: Test new strategies in a virtual environment before real-world deployment.

#### Core Features:
- **Recursive Strategy Improvement**: Use recursive functions to constantly refine decision-making algorithms.
- **Meta-Learning**: Learn how to learn from past experiences.
- **Dynamic Goal Adaptation**: Adjust objectives based on current performance and environmental feedback.

### Implementation Sketch:

```python
import random
import json
from typing import Any, Callable

class RecursiveLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, environment, simulate_func: Callable, max_iterations=1000):
        self.environment = environment
        self.knowledge_base = {}
        self.simulate_func = simulate_func
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations
        self.current_strategy = None

    def recursive_optimize(self, depth=0, max_depth=5):
        if depth > max_depth:
            return self.current_strategy

        potential_strategies = self.generate_strategies(self.current_strategy)
        best_strategy = self.evaluate_strategies(potential_strategies)
        
        self.current_strategy = best_strategy
        return self.recursive_optimize(depth + 1, max_depth)

    def generate_strategies(self, current_strategy: Any) -> list:
        # Generate variations of the current strategy
        new_strategies = [self.mutate_strategy(current_strategy) for _ in range(5)]
        return new_strategies

    def mutate_strategy(self, strategy: Any) -> Any:
        # Randomly change parts of the strategy
        return strategy  # This should implement actual mutation logic

    def evaluate_strategies(self, strategies: list) -> Any:
        scores = [(strategy, self.simulate_func(self.environment, strategy)) for strategy in strategies]
        best_strategy = max(scores, key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
        return best_strategy

    def learn(self):
        print("Starting recursive optimization...")
        best_strategy = self.recursive_optimize()
        print(f"Optimal strategy found: {json.dumps(best_strategy, indent=2)}")
        return best_strategy

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    def simulate(environment, strategy):
        # Placeholder for strategy evaluation function
        return random.random()  # Random score representing strategy effectiveness

    mock_environment = {}  # Placeholder for environment object
    agent = RecursiveLearningAgent(mock_environment, simulate)
    optimal_strategy = agent.learn()
```

### Explanation:

1. **RecursiveLearningAgent**: The class manages the recursive process of optimizing strategies.
   - **recursive_optimize()**: Recursively refines strategies to improve performance.
   - **generate_strategies()** and **mutate_strategy()**: Create new potential strategies by mutating the current one.
   - **evaluate_strategies()**: Evaluates and selects the best strategy based on simulated outcomes.

2. **Simulation Function**: Provided by the user to simulate and evaluate how effective a strategy is within the given environment.

3. **Expandability**: The module can be expanded to include real-world scenarios, integrate with machine learning models, and include complex environments.

This framework focuses on adaptability and recursive optimization, essential for any autonomous system aiming to self-evolve. For a real-world application, the placeholder sections (like strategy mutation and evaluation) would need to be concretely defined based on the specific requirements and characteristics of PTM's operations and objectives.
