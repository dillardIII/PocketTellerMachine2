Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional empire for this context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a combination of advanced AI techniques, recursive strategies, and system architecture considerations. Below is a conceptual design outline for such a module, focusing on self-evolution and autonomy:

### 1. Overview

The goal is to create a Python module that allows systems to autonomously evolve by integrating machine learning, recursive strategies, and self-monitoring capabilities. This module could leverage deep learning, reinforcement learning, and evolutionary algorithms to adapt and optimize its behavior in response to environmental changes.

### 2. Module Architecture

#### Key Components

1. **Environment Interface (`environment.py`):**
   - Abstraction layer to interact with various environments.
   - Monitors inputs and feedback from the environment.
   - Provides data normalization and state representation.

2. **Evolutionary Algorithm (`evolution.py`):**
   - Implements genetic algorithms and evolutionary strategies.
   - Supports mutation, crossover, and selection processes to optimize AI models.
   - Keeps track of generations and fitness scores.

3. **Recursive Strategy Engine (`recursion.py`):**
   - Implements recursive learning strategies such as hierarchical reinforcement learning.
   - Supports task decomposition and sub-goal identification for complex problem solving.
   - Dynamic recursion depth management based on task complexity and system performance.

4. **Self-Optimization Layer (`self_optimize.py`):**
   - Monitors system performance and resource utilization.
   - Automatically fine-tunes hyperparameters and model architectures.
   - Utilizes meta-learning to accelerate the learning process.

5. **Autonomy Manager (`autonomy.py`):**
   - Coordinates between different components and manages life-cycle of learning models.
   - Ensures seamless integration and execution of self-evolving processes.
   - Ensures compliance with predefined autonomy protocols.

#### Supportive Libraries
- TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning.
- DEAP or EvoPy for evolutionary algorithms.
- OpenAI Gym or custom environments for simulation.

### 3. Module Workflow

#### Initialization
- Import necessary modules and initialize environment.
- Load pre-trained models, if available, and set initial parameters.

#### Learning Cycle
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Interact with the environment to gather state-action-reward data.
   
2. **Model Training:**
   - Use recursive learning strategies to train models on collected data.
   - Apply evolutionary algorithms for population-based optimizations.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Measure model performance using specific metrics.
   - Log performance data for analysis and model selection.

4. **Optimization:**
   - Fine-tune models using self-optimization techniques.
   - Adjust recursive depth and parameters dynamically based on current task demands.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the best performing model to the live environment.
   - Monitor and capture feedback for continuous improvement.

### 4. Example Implementation

Below is a simplified implementation of a recursive strategy within this module:

```python
# recursion.py

class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, model, environment, depth=3):
        self.model = model
        self.environment = environment
        self.depth = depth

    def recursive_learn(self, state, current_depth=0):
        if current_depth >= self.depth:
            return self.model.predict(state)

        # Decompose task
        sub_tasks = self.decompose_task(state)
        outputs = []

        for sub_task in sub_tasks:
            output = self.recursive_learn(sub_task, current_depth + 1)
            outputs.append(output)

        # Aggregate results
        return self.aggregate_results(outputs)

    def decompose_task(self, state):
        # Logic to decompose state into manageable sub-tasks
        return [sub_state for sub_state in state]

    def aggregate_results(self, outputs):
        # Logic to combine outputs of sub-tasks into main task solution
        return sum(outputs) / len(outputs)

# Example of usage
# my_learner = RecursiveLearner(model, environment)
# result = my_learner.recursive_learn(initial_state)
```

### 5. Conclusion

The proposed Python module integrates multiple advanced AI techniques to provide a comprehensive self-evolving autonomy stack. The recursive strategies enable the system to tackle complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts while evolving to improve performance over time. This design lays the foundation for the PTM empire's autonomous systems that can adapt, learn, and optimize on their own.
