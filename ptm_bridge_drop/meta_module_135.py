Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably meaning Personal Transportation Module, but you might have a different context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves building upon machine learning, artificial intelligence, and recursive algorithm strategies. Below is a conceptual layout for such a module, including a hypothetical design and some example code snippets to demonstrate how such a module might be structured.

### Module Name: AutoEvo

#### Overview:
- **Objective**: Enhance self-evolving capabilities of autonomous systems by incorporating recursive learning strategies and adaptive planning.
- **Core Features**:
  - **Recursive Learning**: Implement mechanisms for recursive feedback loops that allow the system to improve autonomously over iterations.
  - **Adaptive Algorithms**: Use reinforcement learning and adaptive heuristics to fine-tune decision-making.
  - **Modular Architecture**: Allow for easy integration and testing of new strategies.
  - **Self-Diagnostics**: Include health checks and debugging capabilities that evolve with the system.

### Example Implementation

```python
# autoevo.py

import numpy as np
import logging
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class AutoEvo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = RandomForestRegressor()
        self.history = []
        self.recursive_depth = 3  # Number of recursive evaluations

    def train(self, X, y):
        """Train the model with input features X and target y."""
        self.model.fit(X, y)
        logging.info("Model trained with current dataset.")

    def predict(self, X):
        """Make predictions and recursively improve them."""
        predictions = self.model.predict(X)
        logging.info(f"Initial predictions: {predictions}")
        return self._recursive_refine(X, predictions, self.recursive_depth)

    def _recursive_refine(self, X, predictions, depth):
        """Recursively refine predictions based on error analysis."""
        if depth == 0:
            return predictions
        residuals = self.calculate_residuals(X, predictions)
        refined_predictions = self.model.predict(X + residuals)
        logging.info(f"Refined predictions at depth {self.recursive_depth - depth}: {refined_predictions}")
        return self._recursive_refine(X, refined_predictions, depth - 1)

    def calculate_residuals(self, X, predictions):
        """Calculate residuals for refining predictions (an innovative placeholder)."""
        # This is a placeholder function that should compute residuals
        # based on a real error analysis of the predictions vs actual.
        return np.random.normal(0, 0.1, size=predictions.shape)

    def log_history(self):
        """Log prediction history for self-diagnostic purposes."""
        self.history.append({
            "iteration": len(self.history),
            "data": {}  # Fill in with pertinent historical data
        })
        logging.info(f"Prediction history logged at iteration {len(self.history)}.")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create synthetic data for demonstration purposes
    X_demo = np.random.rand(10, 2)
    y_demo = np.random.rand(10)

    auto_evo = AutoEvo()
    auto_evo.train(X_demo, y_demo)

    predictions = auto_evo.predict(X_demo)
    auto_evo.log_history()
    print("Final predictions:", predictions)
```

### Innovations and Features Explained:

1. **Recursive Learning**: 
   - The `_recursive_refine` method implements a recursive strategy to improve predictions, based on iterative refinement of the error residuals.

2. **Adaptive Models**: 
   - Chose a `RandomForestRegressor` for initial implementation, but the system is designed to easily swap or upgrade with more sophisticated models.

3. **Self-diagnostics**:
   - `log_history` is designed to allow the system to log changes over iterations, valuable for debugging and system evolution tracking.

4. **Modularity**:
   - By building key functionalities as methods within a class, users can plug in various learning models, define new refinement strategies, and tune recursion depths.

This Python module provides a foundation for developing more niche capabilities and strategies tailored for specific contexts in autonomously evolving systems. Further tuning can involve more complex interactions, real-world data, and advanced strategies for practical deployment.
