Designing a Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical entity) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating an architecture that supports recursive strategies and self-improvement through adaptive algorithms. Below is a conceptual outline of how you could approach this task.

### Overview
1. **Modular Architecture**: Ensure each component is independent yet communicates with others effectively, promoting easy integration and updates.
2. **Recursive Strategies**: Implement layers of algorithms that improve upon themselves with each iteration.
3. **Self-evolution**: Utilize machine learning and genetic algorithms to adapt and optimize the system continually.

### Components of the Module

#### 1. Data Ingestion and Normalization
   - **Purpose**: Gather and preprocess data from various sources.
   - **Key Strategies**: 
     - Use of connectors/APIs to collect data.
     - Normalization to ensure consistency across data inputs.
   - **Sample Code**:
     ```python
     class DataCollector:
         def __init__(self, sources):
             self.sources = sources

         def gather_data(self):
             collected_data = []
             for source in self.sources:
                 data = self.fetch_from_source(source)
                 normalized_data = self.normalize(data)
                 collected_data.append(normalized_data)
             return collected_data

         def fetch_from_source(self, source):
             # Implement data fetching logic here
             pass

         def normalize(self, data):
             # Implement data normalization logic here
             pass
     ```

#### 2. Recursive Analysis Engine
   - **Purpose**: Analyze data recursively to find patterns or improve strategies.
   - **Key Strategies**: 
     - Use of auto-tuning and backtracking methods.
     - Implement recursive neural networks or recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
   - **Sample Code**:
     ```python
     class AnalysisEngine:
         def __init__(self, model):
             self.model = model

         def recursive_analysis(self, data):
             result = self.model.predict(data)
             improved_model = self.self_improve(result)
             self.model = improved_model
             return result

         def self_improve(self, result):
             # Implement model improvement logic
             pass
     ```

#### 3. Decision-Making Layer
   - **Purpose**: Enable the system to make autonomous decisions.
   - **Key Strategies**: 
     - Policy reinforcement learning for decision optimization.
     - Feedback loop integration for constant improvement.
   - **Sample Code**:
     ```python
     class DecisionMaker:
         def __init__(self, strategy):
             self.strategy = strategy

         def decide(self, analysis_results):
             return self.strategy.optimize(analysis_results)

         def feedback_loop(self, outcome):
             # Implement feedback mechanism for strategy improvement
             pass
     ```

#### 4. Self-Evolution Mechanism
   - **Purpose**: Enable constant system evolution without external intervention.
   - **Key Strategies**: 
     - Genetic algorithms for exploring new strategies.
     - Automated testing and deployment.
   - **Sample Code**:
     ```python
     class SelfEvolution:
         def __init__(self, current_state):
             self.current_state = current_state

         def evolve(self):
             new_state = self.genetic_algorithm(self.current_state)
             self.current_state = new_state

         def genetic_algorithm(self, state):
             # Implement genetic algorithm logic to evolve the system
             pass
     ```

### Integration and Deployment
- Containerize the module for scalability and easy deployment, e.g., using Docker.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment of new versions.

### Innovations and Future Work
- Explore integrating quantum algorithms for faster recursive calculations.
- Use federated learning to expand the module's capabilities across distributed systems while maintaining data privacy.

This design leverages state-of-the-art strategies to create a robust autonomy stack that learns, adapts, and evolves autonomously.
