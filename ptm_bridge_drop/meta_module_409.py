Designing a Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably the "PTM" refers to a hypothetical autonomous system, given no specific context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, recursive strategies, and optimization methods. Here's a structured outline and prototype for such a module:

### Module Overview: `ptm_autonomy`

The `ptm_autonomy` module focuses on expanding the autonomy stack of PTM by integrating recursive and self-evolving strategies. This might include self-improving algorithms, recursive decision-making processes, and continuous adaptation mechanisms.

#### Key Features:
1. **Recursive Learning**: Implement self-improving algorithms that enhance performance through recursive iteration over data and models.
2. **Dynamic Environment Adaptation**: Real-time adjustment strategies based on environment feedback to optimize decisions and actions.
3. **Hierarchical Planning**: Break down complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks using hierarchical models.
4. **Self-Optimization**: Utilize genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning to optimize models over time.
5. **Meta-Learning**: Implement meta-algorithms that improve the learning process by tailoring strategies according to past experiences.

### Core Components:

#### 1. `core.py`
This file contains the base classes and framework necessary for module integration.

```python
# core.py
class AutonomousAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = None
        self.model = None

    def perceive(self, environment):
        """Perceive the environment and update internal state."""
        pass

    def decide(self):
        """Make decisions based on current state and model."""
        pass

    def learn(self, feedback):
        """Learn from feedback to improve future performance."""
        pass
```

#### 2. `recursive_learning.py`
Focuses on recursive algorithms to update and improve models continuously.

```python
# recursive_learning.py
import numpy as np

class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, base_model):
        self.model = base_model

    def update(self, data):
        """Recursively update the model based on new data."""
        # Implement recursive model update logic
        pass

def recursive_train(agent, data_stream):
    """Train the agent using recursive strategies."""
    learner = RecursiveLearner(agent.model)
    for data in data_stream:
        agent.perceive(data)
        agent.decide()
        feedback = data.get_feedback()  # Hypothetical method
        learner.update(feedback)
```

#### 3. `dynamic_adaptation.py`
Enables real-time adaptation to environmental changes.

```python
# dynamic_adaptation.py
class DynamicAdapter:
    def __init__(self, agent):
        self.agent = agent

    def adapt(self, environment_change):
        """Adjust agent strategy based on environment change."""
        # Implement adaption logic
        pass
```

#### 4. `hierarchical_planning.py`
Manages task decomposition into simpler sub-tasks.

```python
# hierarchical_planning.py
class TaskPlanner:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def plan(self, task):
        """Decompose task into hierarchical plan."""
        # Implement task decomposition logic
        pass
```

#### 5. `self_optimization.py`
Focuses on genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning for optimization.

```python
# self_optimization.py
class Optimizer:
    def __init__(self, agent):
        self.agent = agent

    def optimize(self):
        """Optimize agent model using genetic or RL strategies."""
        # Implement optimization logic
        pass
```

#### 6. `meta_learning.py`
Implements learning-to-learn strategies.

```python
# meta_learning.py
class MetaLearner:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def enhance_learning(self, learning_strategy):
        """Improve learning strategy based on meta-learning."""
        # Implement meta-learning logic
        pass
```

### Usage Example:
```python
from ptm_autonomy.core import AutonomousAgent
from ptm_autonomy.recursive_learning import recursive_train
from ptm_autonomy.dynamic_adaptation import DynamicAdapter

# Instantiate core agent and environment
agent = AutonomousAgent()
environment = ...  # Define or simulate an environment

# Train the agent using recursive strategies
data_stream = ...  # Stream of environmental data
recursive_train(agent, data_stream)

# Adapt to environmental changes
adapter = DynamicAdapter(agent)
adapter.adapt(environment)
```

### Conclusion:
This module structure provides a robust framework for enhancing PTM's autonomy stack using modern AI techniques. By integrating recursive learning, dynamic adaptation, hierarchical planning, self-optimization, and meta-learning, the module supports a versatile and self-evolving system suitable for complex, real-world applications.
