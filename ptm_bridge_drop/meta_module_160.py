Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictitious empire pertaining to self-evolving technologies) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires us to consider robust, scalable, and innovative strategies to facilitate autonomous decision-making, learning, and adaptation over time. Here's a conceptual outline and a Python code structure for such a module using recursive strategies:

### Module Overview

1. **Recursive Learning Algorithms**: Implement a recursive approach to machine learning where models can dynamically adjust and improve through recursive feedback loops. This is useful in self-evolving systems where constant adaptation and improvement are needed.

2. **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Develop recursive decision-making protocols that allow the system to make decisions at multiple levels with self-correction capabilities.

3. **Data-Driven Self-Optimization**: Include mechanisms for data-driven optimization that enhance performance by continuously analyzing and adapting based on new data inputs.

```

### Key Features:

- **Recursive Learning**: The module updates its predictive model based on errors in predictions using a feedback loop.
- **Recursive Decision Making**: It can make decisions recursively, allowing deeper analysis and decision layers.
- **Self-Optimization**: The module includes a placeholder for optimization based on feedback, allowing the model and its parameters to adapt over time.

This pseudo code represents a basic framework and starting point for enhancing the PTM empire's autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies. It can be extended with more complex models, richer decision logic, and advanced optimization strategies.
