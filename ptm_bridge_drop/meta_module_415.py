Designing a Python module that expands the PTM (Presumed Technological Marvel?) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves numerous complex steps. Below is an outline of the architecture and a sample implementation to guide the development of such a module. This example focuses on creating a modular, recursive approach to evolving a set of autonomous agents' behavior via machine learning and self-improvement.

### Module Architecture

1. **Data Handling**: Efficient handling of training data and autonomous agent state data.
2. **Recursive Strategy Engine**: Recursive algorithms for self-improvement, learning, and adaptation.
3. **Machine Learning**: Integration with ML algorithms for continuous learning and optimization.
4. **Simulation Environment**: A sandbox where agents can test and evolve their strategies.
5. **Communication Layer**: Protocols for agents to communicate and collaborate.
6. **Monitoring and Analytics**: Tools for tracking the evolution and performance of different strategies.

### Sample Implementation

Here's a simplified module outline using Python:

```python
# import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import random
from copy import deepcopy

# Define a recursive strategy class
class RecursiveStrategy:
    def __init__(self, strategy_function):
        self.strategy_function = strategy_function

    def evolve(self, data):
        """
        Evolve the strategy using recursive algorithms and learning.
        """
        # Call recursively to refine the strategy
        return self._recursive_improve(data, self.strategy_function, depth=3)

    def _recursive_improve(self, data, strategy, depth):
        if depth == 0:
            return strategy

        # Here, refine the strategy based on data
        improved_strategy = strategy + np.mean(data)  # Just a placeholder logic for demonstration

        return self._recursive_improve(data, improved_strategy, depth - 1)


# Define a simple machine learning model placeholder
class LearningModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model_params = random.random()

    def train(self, data):
        # Training logic (simplified)
        self.model_params = np.mean(data)

    def predict(self, input_data):
        # Prediction logic (simplified)
        return self.model_params * input_data


# Define the Autonomous Agent class
class AutonomousAgent:
    def __init__(self, strategy_function):
        self.strategy = RecursiveStrategy(strategy_function)
        self.model = LearningModel()

    def evolve_strategy(self, data):
        """
        Evolve and improve the agent's strategy.
        """
        self.strategy.evolve(data)
        self.model.train(data)

    def act(self, input_data):
        """
        Act based on current strategy and model predictions.
        """
        prediction = self.model.predict(input_data)
        print(f"Acting with prediction: {prediction}")


# Simulate the environment
class SimulationEnvironment:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        self.agents = agents

    def run_simulation(self, data):
        """
        Run the simulation to let agents evolve.
        """
        for agent in self.agents:
            agent.evolve_strategy(data)
            agent.act(random.choice(data))


# Initialize and run the module
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a list of agents with random initial strategies
    agents = [AutonomousAgent(random.random()) for _ in range(5)]
    env = SimulationEnvironment(agents)

    # Simulate with random data
    environment_data = np.random.rand(10)
    env.run_simulation(environment_data)
```

### Key Components Explained

- **Recursive Strategy**: Uses a recursive approach to refine and improve a strategy by using past data and recursive logic.
- **LearningModel**: Acts as a placeholder for actual ML models, demonstrating continuous learning and adjustment based on data.
- **AutonomousAgent**: Represents individual agents with evolving strategies. Each agent can improve itself autonomously.
- **SimulationEnvironment**: Provides a controlled environment for agents to apply and further refine their strategies.

### Future Enhancements

- **Advanced ML Algorithms**: Integrate neural networks or advanced ML models.
- **Collaborative Strategy Development**: Enable agents to share and collaboratively evolve strategies.
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Implement real-time data handling for dynamic environments.
- **Complex Environment Simulation**: More sophisticated simulation conditions to better mimic real-world challenges.

This module can be expanded and specialized further depending on the specific needs and goals of the PTM empire for achieving self-evolving autonomy.
