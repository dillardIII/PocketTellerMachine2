Designing a new Python module for the PTM (Presumably an entity in need of an autonomy stack) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves a sophisticated approach that incorporates the latest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and systems design. Below, I outline a conceptual blueprint for such a module, focusing on recursive strategies and innovative techniques.

### Module Overview

**Module Name:** `PTMEvolution`

### Key Components

1. **Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs):**
   - **Objective:** Implement RNNs to facilitate decision-making processes that involve sequential dependencies.
   - **Functionality:** Use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for effective time-series prediction and decision-making.

2. **Self-Evolutionary Algorithms:**
   - **Objective:** Enable the autonomy stack to learn and adapt over time without explicit programming.
   - **Functionality:** Integrate genetic algorithms that mutate and evolve strategies based on a feedback loop from their environment to optimize performance metrics.

3. **Reinforcement Learning (RL):**
   - **Objective:** Implement RL for autonomous task execution with minimal human intervention.
   - **Functionality:** Use proximal policy optimization (PPO) or deep Q-learning (DQL) to train the model to improve over time.

4. **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - **Objective:** Enhance model performance automatically by adjusting hyperparameters.
   - **Functionality:** Utilize Bayesian optimization or grid/random search to find optimal parameters for each situational module task.

5. **Hierarchical Task Management:**
   - **Objective:** Dissect complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks, allowing for modular learning and execution.
   - **Functionality:** Create a task scheduler that can recursively split tasks, learn, and collaborate across tasks.

6. **Neural Architecture Search (NAS):**
   - **Objective:** Automate the design of neural network architectures.
   - **Functionality:** Integrate NAS techniques to self-generate neural networks suited to specific tasks.

7. **Adaptive Feedback Loops:**
   - **Objective:** Implement continuous learning from system outputs.
   - **Functionality:** Use recursive feedback loops that analyze system performance and encourage iterative improvement.

### Sample Python Skeleton

Here's a basic Python skeleton for `PTMEvolution`:

```python
# ptm_evolution.py

class PTMEvolution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model_architecture = None
        self.hyperparameters = {}
        self.task_queue = []

    def initialize_rnn(self):
        """Set up a Recursive Neural Network."""
        # Placeholder for initializing an RNN with LSTM or GRU
        pass

    def develop_evolutionary_strategy(self):
        """Create self-evolutionary algorithms."""
        # Implement a basic genetic algorithm structure
        pass
    
    def train_with_reinforcement_learning(self, environment):
        """Use RL for training the model."""
        # Implement training loop using RL methods like PPO
        pass

    def automatic_hyperparameter_tuning(self):
        """Adjust model hyperparameters dynamically."""
        # Implement Bayesian optimization or grid search
        pass

    def execute_hierarchical_task_management(self, task):
        """Break down and manage tasks recursively."""
        # Split tasks and manage execution flow
        pass

    def perform_neural_architecture_search(self):
        """Search for the best neural network architecture."""
        # Utilize NAS algorithms here
        pass
    
    def adaptive_feedback(self, output):
        """Continuous learning from outputs."""
        # Implement recursive feedback analysis and learning
        pass
    
# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ptm_stack = PTMEvolution()
    ptm_stack.initialize_rnn()
    ptm_stack.develop_evolutionary_strategy()
    # Execute further tasks and methods
```

### Implementation Notes

- **Modularity:** Ensure each component (like RNN and RL) is modular, allowing easy updates and maintenance.
- **Scalability:** Design with scaling in mind to adapt to larger datasets and more complex tasks as they emerge.
- **Testing and Validation:** Rigorous testing with diverse scenarios to ensure robustness and efficiency.

This architecture is conceptual and would need substantial customization and attachment to specific datasets, environments, and real-world scenarios relevant to the PTM's mission and capabilities.
