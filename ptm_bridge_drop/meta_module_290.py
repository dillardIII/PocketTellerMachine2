Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional empire or company) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves a considerable amount of planning and creativity. Below is a conceptual outline and a snippet of code that illustrates how to structure such a module. For the purposes of this explanation, we'll assume PTM's stack involves autonomous decision-making, learning, and adaptation, perhaps in scenarios like robotics, AI strategy games, or autonomous vehicles.

### Conceptual Outline

1. **Module Overview**:
   - Name: `ptm_recursive_autonomy`
   - Purpose: To enhance PTMâ€™s autonomy stack with recursive strategies for goal achievement, adaptation, and self-improvement.
   - Core Features:
     - Recursive Decision Trees
     - Self-Evolving Learning Patterns
     - Adaptive Feedback Loops
     - Contextual Strategy Optimization

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Recursive Decision Engine**: Handles decision-making processes that build upon previous outcomes using recursive logic.
   - **Learning Patterns**: Utilizes machine learning techniques that evolve based on historical performance data.
   - **Feedback System**: Collects data to refine strategies using input from the environment.
   - **Optimization Module**: Continuously seeks the most efficient paths to achieving set goals, adjusting tactics dynamically.

3. **Innovative Strategies**:
   - **Goal-Oriented Recursion**: Execute recursive methods that focus on breaking down complex goals into manageable sub-goals.
   - **Pattern Recognition**: Leverage machine learning for detecting and adapting to new patterns automatically.
   - **Adaptive Simulations**: Run simulations recursively to predict and prepare for different scenarios.

### Example Python Code Snippet

```python
# ptm_recursive_autonomy module

from typing import Any, Tuple, List, Callable

class RecursiveEngine:
    """Handles recursive decision-making and strategy adaptation."""
    
    def __init__(self, strategy_function: Callable):
        self.strategy_function = strategy_function
        self.history = []
        
    def execute_strategy(self, context: Any, goal: Any) -> Any:
        """Execute strategy recursively until a goal is achieved."""
        if self.is_goal_met(context, goal):
            return context
        
        decision = self.strategy_function(context)
        self.history.append(decision)
        
        return self.execute_strategy(decision, goal)
    
    def is_goal_met(self, context: Any, goal: Any) -> bool:
        """Override to define goal condition."""
        raise NotImplementedError("Please implement the goal condition.")
    
class LearningPattern:
    """Implements pattern recognition and adaptation."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the learning model here (e.g., neural network, decision tree)
        self.model = self.initialize_model()
    
    def initialize_model(self) -> Any:
        """Set up the learning model."""
        pass  # Add specific model initialization here
    
    def adapt_to_data(self, data: List[Any]) -> None:
        """Adapt the model using new data."""
        # Apply learning algorithm on the input data
        pass
    
    def predict(self, input_data: Any) -> Any:
        """Make predictions using the model."""
        # Use the learning model for predictions
        pass

class FeedbackSystem:
    """Aggregate feedback and updates strategies."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.collected_data = []
    
    def collect_feedback(self, context: Any, outcome: Any) -> None:
        """Collect feedback from recent decisions."""
        self.collected_data.append((context, outcome))
    
    def refine_strategy(self):
        """Refine strategies based on collected feedback."""
        # Implement strategy refinement logic
        pass

# Example instantiation and invocation
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define a basic strategy function (stub for illustration)
    def sample_strategy(context):
        return context + 1
    
    # Instantiate the recursive engine with a sample strategy
    engine = RecursiveEngine(strategy_function=sample_strategy)
    
    # Execute the strategy, given an initial context and goal
    try:
        result = engine.execute_strategy(0, 10)  # Arbitrary goal for demonstration
        print(f"Final Context: {result}")
    except NotImplementedError:
        print("Please implement the `is_goal_met` method.")
```

### Ideas for Expansion:
- Implement diverse machine learning models that can handle time-series data, image/climate data, etc., based on PTM's needs.
- Explore techniques like reinforcement learning for the Feedback System to achieve continuous improvement via trial and error.
- Incorporate advanced simulation algorithms to project long-term strategy effectiveness.

This outline and code provide a foundation that can be expanded significantly based on the specific requirements and domains of the PTM empire's autonomous stack.
