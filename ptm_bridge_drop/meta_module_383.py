Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably some autonomous system) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack, particularly with innovative recursive strategies, requires a methodical approach. Here’s a conceptual overview along with an outline for such a module:

### Module Name:
`recursive_autonomy_expansion`

### Objectives:
1. Facilitate self-evolving capabilities in PTM's autonomy stack.
2. Implement recursive learning and decision-making strategies.
3. Ensure robust handling of dynamic environments and complexities.
4. Provide a modular and extensible architecture for future upgrades.

### Key Components:

#### 1. Environment Interface
This component abstracts the interaction with the environment, enabling perception and action.

```python
class EnvironmentInterface:
    def __init__(self, environment):
        self.environment = environment
        
    def perceive(self):
        # Implement environment sensing and perception logic
        pass

    def act(self, actions):
        # Implement action-taking logic based on chosen actions
        pass
```

#### 2. Recursive Learning Agent
An agent that uses recursive strategies for continuous learning and adaptation.

```python
class RecursiveLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        self.experience_memory = []

    def recursive_learn(self, data):
        # Basic idea of recursive strategy
        self.experience_memory.append(data)
        
        # Learning & updating model recursively
        if len(self.experience_memory) > threshold:
            self.model.update(self.experience_memory)
            self.experience_memory = []  # Forget after learning (optional)
        
    def decide(self, state):
        # Decision making using the current model
        return self.model.predict(state)
    
    def self_evaluate(self):
        # Self-evaluation for improvement
        pass
```

#### 3. Self-Evolving Model
A model that can self-update based on recursive feedbacks.

```python
class SelfEvolvingModel:
    def __init__(self):
        # Model initialization
        pass

    def update(self, experience_memory):
        # Update model based on accumulated experience
        pass

    def predict(self, state):
        # Predict the next action or state
        pass
```

#### 4. Recursive Strategy Manager
Manages different recursive strategies like recursive feature expansion, knowledge distillation, etc.

```python
class RecursiveStrategyManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize strategies
        pass
    
    def execute_strategy(self, agent, environment):
        # Example of executing a recursive strategy
        state = environment.perceive()
        action = agent.decide(state)
        environment.act(action)
        feedback = environment.perceive()  # Get feedback after action
        agent.recursive_learn(feedback)
```

### Extensibility
- **Plugins**: Allow third-party developers to add new recursive strategies.
- **APIs**: Expose APIs for easy integration and expansion.
- **Configuration Files**: Use configuration files for flexible parameter tuning and strategy selection.

### Example Usage

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create Environment and Agent
    environment = EnvironmentInterface(my_environment)
    agent = RecursiveLearningAgent(SelfEvolvingModel())
    
    # Create and execute Strategy
    strategy_manager = RecursiveStrategyManager()
    for _ in range(NUM_EPISODES):
        strategy_manager.execute_strategy(agent, environment)
```

### Considerations
- **Performance**: Ensure the models and recursive strategies are computationally efficient.
- **Safety**: Design systems to ensure safe exploration and exploitation of new strategies.
- **Ethics**: Implement ethical considerations for autonomous actions.

### Future Innovations
- **Hybrid Recursive Approaches**: Combine analytical and data-driven recursive methods.
- **Distributed Recursive Systems**: Perform recursive learning across multiple agents in a distributed fashion.

The outlined module provides a framework with ample space for innovation, leveraging recursive strategies to enhance the PTM empire’s autonomy stack efficiently.
