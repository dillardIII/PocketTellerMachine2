Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably an advanced tech company or framework) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can adapt, learn, and optimize its performance over time. I'll lay out a conceptual design for this module, incorporating innovative recursive strategies that leverage machine learning, reinforcement learning, and automated self-improvement.

### Module: `SelfEvolver`

#### Features

1. **Recursive Learning Framework**: The module continually refines its learning models using recursive strategies that analyze previous iterations to increase efficiency and performance.

2. **Automated Data Pipeline**: Includes tools for automated data collection, preprocessing, and augmentation to ensure that models are always trained on the most relevant datasets.

3. **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Engine**: An embedded RL engine that enables models to make decisions in dynamic environments and learn optimal strategies through reward-based feedback.

4. **Self-optimization Mechanism**: Continuous hyperparameter tuning and model architecture refinement using techniques like genetic algorithms or Bayesian optimization.

5. **Anomaly Detection and Correction**: Integrated module to detect outliers and anomalies during training and operation, with mechanisms to either learn from these occurrences or correct them in real-time.

6. **Modular Architecture**: Easy integration with existing systems through clear interfaces and plug-and-play components that allow quick expansion and customization.

class SelfEvolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = None
        self.data_pipeline = self._create_data_pipeline()
        self.rl_engine = self._create_rl_engine()
        
    def _create_data_pipeline(self):
        def load_data():
            # Logic for loading data
            pass

        def preprocess_data(data):
            # Standardize or normalize input features
            scaler = StandardScaler()
            return scaler.fit_transform(data)

        return {'load': load_data, 'process': preprocess_data}

    def _create_rl_engine(self):
        env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
        return ReinforcementLearner(env)

    def train(self, X, y):
        # Recursive learning process
        X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
        self.model = self._select_model()
        self._train_model(X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val)
        
    def _select_model(self):
        # Model selection logic, potentially using Bayesian Optimization
        model = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(4, 24), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(24, 2))
        return model

    def _train_model(self, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val):
        criterion = nn.MSELoss()
        optimizer = optim.Adam(self.model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
        # Implement recursive training loop
        for epoch in range(100):
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = self.model(torch.FloatTensor(X_train))
            loss = criterion(outputs, torch.FloatTensor(y_train))
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            self._recursive_adjustment(epoch, loss)

    def _recursive_adjustment(self, epoch, loss):
        # Feedback from current learning iteration used to refine future iterations
        if epoch % 10 == 0:
            print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
            # Adjust hyperparameters or learning strategy

    def optimize_hyperparameters(self, X, y):
        search = BayesSearchCV(
            estimator=SVC(),
            search_spaces={
                'C': (1e-6, 1e+6, 'log-uniform'),
                'gamma': (1e-6, 1e+1, 'log-uniform'),
                'degree': (1, 8),
                'kernel': ['linear', 'poly', 'rbf']
            },
            n_iter=32,
            n_jobs=-1,
            cv=3
        )

        search.fit(X, y)
        self.model = search.best_estimator_

class ReinforcementLearner:
    def __init__(self, env):
        self.env = env

    def train_agent(self):
        # Implement an RL training loop
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    evolver = SelfEvolver()
    # Assume X and y are predefined datasets
    evolver.train(X, y)
    evolver.rl_engine.train_agent()
```

#### Considerations

- **Scalability**: The design should easily accommodate additional features like support for distributed training or integration with cloud services for expansive data processing capabilities.
- **Security**: Ensure the module has built-in security measures, especially if dealing with sensitive data.
- **Flexibility**: Make the module customizable and extendable, allowing for integration of new learning algorithms or model architectures without significant overhaul.

Implementing such a module would take considerable time and testing, especially ensuring that recursive learning strategies efficiently improve the model without overfitting or degrading performance.
