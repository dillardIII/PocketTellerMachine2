Designing a new Python module for the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can adapt, learn, and optimize its operations over time. The focus on innovative recursive strategies suggests an approach where the system leverages recursive functions and data structures to achieve self-improvement and adaptability. Below is a conceptual design and outline for such a module, including core components and strategies.

### Module: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Core Objectives:
1. **Self-Evolution**: Enable the system to evolve its strategies and behaviors based on past performance and external feedback.
2. **Recursive Learning**: Use recursive approaches to break down complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks, solve them, and then integrate solutions for enhanced performance.
3. **Adaptive Optimization**: Continuously adjust parameters and strategies for optimal performance in dynamic environments.

#### Key Components:
1. **Recursive Learning Agent**
   - **Purpose**: An agent that employs recursive algorithms to improve decision-making and learning processes.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Divide complex tasks into sub-tasks using a recursive task planner.
     - Solve sub-tasks iteratively, leveraging previous solutions to improve efficiency.

2. **Feedback-Driven Evolution**
   - **Purpose**: A mechanism to adapt and evolve strategies based on feedback and performance metrics.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Collect feedback from the environment and evaluate performance.
     - Use genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning to evolve decision-making policies.

3. **Adaptive Parameter Tuning**
   - **Purpose**: Dynamically adjust system parameters to optimize performance.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Implement self-tuning algorithms that monitor performance metrics.
     - Use recursive optimization strategies to fine-tune parameters.

4. **Memory-Augmented Neural Networks**
   - **Purpose**: Enhance learning capabilities by using memory networks.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Store past experiences and leverage them through attention mechanisms.
     - Enable complex reasoning over sequences of past events.

5. **Simulation and Iteration Framework**
   - **Purpose**: Test and iterate strategies in simulated environments before deployment.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Create virtual environments to simulate real-world scenarios.
     - Employ recursive simulation to evaluate multiple strategies efficiently.

    def plan(self, task):
        # Recursive task planner
        pass

    def solve(self, sub_task):
        # Recursive problem-solving
        pass

# Feedback-Driven Evolution
class FeedbackDrivenEvolution:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize feedback structures
        pass

    def evolve(self):
        # Implement evolutionary strategies
        pass

# Adaptive Parameter Tuning
class AdaptiveParameterTuning:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize tuning mechanisms
        pass

    def tune(self):
        # Recursive parameter tuning
        pass

# Memory-Augmented Neural Networks
class MemoryNetwork:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize memory structures
        pass

    def remember(self, experience):
        # Store and retrieve experiences
        pass

# Simulation and Iteration Framework
class SimulationFramework:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize simulation environment
        pass

    def simulate(self):
        # Run recursive simulations
        pass

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = RecursiveLearningAgent()
    feedback_system = FeedbackDrivenEvolution()
    tuner = AdaptiveParameterTuning()
    memory_net = MemoryNetwork()
    simulator = SimulationFramework()

    # Implement tasks and recursive strategies
    ...
```

### Implementation Details:
- **Recursive Approach**: Implement tasks and learning processes using recursive functions to break them into manageable parts.
- **Feedback Loop**: Establish a continuous feedback loop for learning and optimization.
- **Simulation for Safety**: Test all new strategies in simulated environments to ensure safety and efficiency before real-world deployment.

This module offers a framework for creating an adaptable and self-evolving autonomy stack using innovative recursive strategies.
