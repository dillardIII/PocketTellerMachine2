Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a placeholder name) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a focus on incorporating advanced capabilities such as self-optimization, recursive learning, and adaptive strategies. Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of a Python module with some innovative recursive strategies:

### Module: `ptm_autonomy.py`

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import logging

# Set up basic logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class AutoLearner:
    """
    A class that implements a self-optimizing learning process using a recursive strategy.
    """
    def __init__(self, base_model=RandomForestClassifier(), max_iters=10, threshold=0.01):
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.max_iters = max_iters
        self.threshold = threshold
        self.history = []

    def fit(self, X, y):
        X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
        scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X_train)
        X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
        X_val_scaled = scaler.transform(X_val)

        previous_accuracy = 0
        for i in range(self.max_iters):
            logging.info(f"Iteration {i+1}")
            self.base_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
            predictions = self.base_model.predict(X_val_scaled)
            accuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, predictions)
            self.history.append(accuracy)
            logging.info(f"Validation accuracy: {accuracy}")

            # Check for recursive optimization conditions
            if i > 0 and abs(accuracy - previous_accuracy) < self.threshold:
                logging.info("Stopping early due to negligible improvement.")
                break
            
            # Simulate dynamic model adjustments - hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, etc.
            self.recursive_adjustment()

            previous_accuracy = accuracy

    def recursive_adjustment(self):
        """
        Placeholder for dynamic adaptive strategies, like hyperparameter tuning or feature engineering.
        """
        logging.info("Performing recursive adjustment.")
        # Example: Randomly adjusting hyperparameters (this could be more sophisticated)
        self.base_model.n_estimators = np.random.randint(80, 200)
        self.base_model.max_depth = np.random.randint(5, 50)

    def predict(self, X):
        """
        Predict using the trained model.
        """
        scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X)
        X_scaled = scaler.transform(X)
        return self.base_model.predict(X_scaled)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Mock some data
    X = np.random.rand(1000, 20)   # 1000 samples, 20 features
    y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)  # Binary targets

    learner = AutoLearner()
    learner.fit(X, y)
    predictions = learner.predict(X)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y, predictions)
    logging.info(f"Final accuracy on the entire dataset: {accuracy}")
```

### Key Features

1. **Self-Optimization**: The model automatically adjusts its parameters during training through a simple recursive adjustment strategy.
   
2. **Early Stopping**: If successive improvements are smaller than a given threshold, the training process halts early to save resources.

3. **Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning**: Illustrative example of adjusting hyperparameters randomly, could be replaced with more sophisticated optimization techniques like Bayesian Optimization or Grid Search.

4. **Scalability**: The class and methods are designed to easily integrate with larger autonomy stacks or pipelines.

5. **Logging for Transparency**: Tracks progress and decisions during the training process, useful for debugging and understanding the model's behavior.

### Future Considerations

- **Integration with Reinforcement Learning**: To enable real-time decision-making and continuous improvement based on environmental feedback.
- **Incorporation of Neural Networks**: Experiment with neural network models for complex tasks, expanding beyond ensemble methods.
- **Data Stream Handling**: Implement online learning techniques for dynamic data environments.
- **Automated Data Augmentation & Feature Engineering**: Enhance model generalizability and robustness.

This module provides a foundational step towards building a more sophisticated and autonomous learning system, setting the stage for further innovations in the PTM empire's self-evolving strategies.
