To design a new Python module for expanding PTM (Presumably an acronym for a fictitious "Prime Tech Module" or similar) empireâ€™s self-evolving autonomy stack, we need to focus on integrating recursive strategies that allow the system to adapt and enhance itself over time. We can draw upon concepts from machine learning, genetic programming, and reinforcement learning to create a module that can train and evolve autonomously. Below is a high-level overview and example code for such a module.

### Module: `ptm_autonomy`

**Objective**: Develop a module enabling autonomous evolution and adaptation using recursive strategies. The module will involve components like environment simulation, dynamic strategy formulation, self-improvement through feedback loops, and genetic evolution approaches.

### Key Components

1. **Environment Simulation**: A virtual space where the PTMs can interact and evolve.
2. **Recursive Strategy Learning**: Mechanisms for the autonomy stack to recursively evaluate and enhance its strategies.
3. **Genetic Programming**: Implementing genetic algorithms to iterate and improve the members of the stack.
4. **Feedback Mechanism**: Continuous feedback loop for performance assessment and iterative improvement.

### Python Code Example

```python
import random
import numpy as np


class SimulatedEnvironment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = self.initialize_state()
    
    def initialize_state(self):
        # Initialize the environment state with random metrics
        return np.random.rand(5)

    def simulate(self, actions):
        # Dummy implementation of environment dynamics
        return self.state + np.dot(actions, np.random.rand(5, 5))

    def evaluate(self, state):
        # Simple evaluation function: Higher sum of state values is better
        return np.sum(state)


class Strategy:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize with random weights
        self.weights = np.random.rand(5)

    def decide_actions(self, state):
        # Make decisions based on current strategy
        return state * self.weights

    def mutate(self):
        mutation_strength = 0.1
        self.weights += np.random.normal(0, mutation_strength, size=self.weights.shape)

        
class PTM_Entity:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategy = Strategy()

    def improve(self, environment):
        current_state = environment.state
        actions = self.strategy.decide_actions(current_state)
        new_state = environment.simulate(actions)
        performance = environment.evaluate(new_state)
        return new_state, performance

    def adapt(self, feedback_performance):
        if feedback_performance < threshold:
            self.strategy.mutate()  # Evolve only if underperforming


class PTM_Empire:
    def __init__(self, num_entities=10):
        self.entities = [PTM_Entity() for _ in range(num_entities)]
        self.environment = SimulatedEnvironment()

    def evolve(self, iterations=100):
        for _ in range(iterations):
            for entity in self.entities:
                new_state, performance = entity.improve(self.environment)
                feedback_performance = self.environment.evaluate(new_state)
                entity.adapt(feedback_performance)

    def best_strategy(self):
        best_performance = float('-inf')
        best_strategy = None

        for entity in self.entities:
            _, performance = entity.improve(self.environment)
            if performance > best_performance:
                best_performance = performance
                best_strategy = entity.strategy

        return best_strategy


# Running the PTM empire evolution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ptm_empire = PTM_Empire()
    ptm_empire.evolve(1000)
    best = ptm_empire.best_strategy()
    print("Best Strategy:", best.weights)
```

### Explanation

- **Simulated Environment**: The class creates a simplified dynamical system where entities can act and be evaluated on their performance.
- **Recursive Strategy Learning**: PTM entities utilize strategies to decide on actions based on the current state and evolve these strategies over time through mutation.
- **Genetic Programming**: Incorporated through the mutation mechanics. Strategies mutate to explore the solution space.
- **Feedback Integration**: Entities improve through feedback loops comparing their performance to a predefined threshold.
- **Automation**: Recursive strategies ensure that each entity in the PTM empire autonomously works towards optimization.

### Conclusion

This module encapsulates the innovative recursive strategies using genetic programming and autonomous feedback integration, providing a self-evolving autonomy stack for the PTM empire. This design emphasizes adaptability, scalability, and continuous self-improvement, aiming to maintain an edge in diverse operational domains.
