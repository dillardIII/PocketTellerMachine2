Designing a new Python module for the PTM (Presumably, Personalized Transportation Machine) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack is an ambitious task. We'll focus on constructing a framework that leverages recursive strategies and machine learning to enable self-adaptation and continuous learning. The primary goal is to ensure that the vehicle can safely, efficiently, and autonomously navigate diverse environments.

### Python Module: PTM_SelfEvolver

#### Key Features:
1. **Self-Improving Algorithms**: Implement algorithms that can reassess their strategies based on past performance.
2. **Data-Driven Adaptation**: Leverage large-scale data analysis to inform decision-making.
3. **Recursive Learning**: Use recursive neural networks for pattern recognition and prediction.
4. **Simulation and Real-World Feedback Loops**: Integrate simulated environments with real-world data to improve accuracy.
5. **Modular Architecture**: Design the module so it can be easily scaled and integrated with other components.

#### Sample Code Snippet for Recursive Learning

```python
# learning.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, LSTM

class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, input_shape):
        self.model = self._build_model(input_shape)
    
    def _build_model(self, input_shape):
        model = Sequential()
        model.add(LSTM(64, input_shape=input_shape, return_sequences=True))
        model.add(LSTM(64))
        model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
        model.add(Dense(1, activation='linear'))
        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
        return model
    
    def train(self, X, y):
        X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), epochs=50, batch_size=32)
    
    def predict(self, X):
        return self.model.predict(X)

    def update(self, new_data, new_labels):
        # Incremental training for recursive learning
        self.train(new_data, new_labels)
```

### Recursive Strategies:

- **Adaptive Feedback Control**: Continuously update control parameters based on historical data.
- **Online Reinforcement Learning**: Utilize methodologies like Q-learning or Actor-Critic to adapt policy decisions in a recursive fashion.

### Integration:
The module should be easily integrable with existing PTM architecture to allow seamless updates and improvements without service interruption.

### Testing:
Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests using frameworks like `pytest`.

The PTM_SelfEvolver module uses recursive strategies and self-evolving mechanisms to assure that the autonomy stack can adapt quickly and effectively to new situations, enhancing both safety and performance.
