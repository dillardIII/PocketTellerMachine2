Developing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a metaphorical or fictional empire) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack can be an intriguing and challenging task. This would involve the design of recursive strategies that allow the system to evolve and adapt autonomously. Below, I'll provide a conceptual outline and a basic implementation to get you started.

### Conceptual Outline:

1. **Dynamic Module Loading**:
   - Leverage Python's `importlib` to dynamically load modules.
   - This enables the system to adapt to new strategies without complete redeployment.

2. **Recursive Strategies**:
   - Implement a recursive function that continually evaluates and updates strategies.
   - Utilize functional programming concepts to handle recursion efficiently.
   - Support parallel processing using Python's `concurrent.futures` to manage recursive tasks efficiently.

3. **Self-Optimization**:
   - Keep track of performance metrics for each strategy using decorators.
   - Employ machine learning models to predict the performance of different stacked strategies.
   
4. **Extensibility**:
   - Allow new strategies to be added as plugins. Implement a plugin interface.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Continuous logging of the recursive process and evaluations.
   - Monitor system performance in real-time using a dashboard built with a library like `Dash` or `Flask`.

6. **Introspection and Learning**:
   - Implement modules that allow the system to introspect its own state and learn from past experiences.
   - Machine learning models can suggest modifications or new strategies based on historic data.

### Basic Implementation:

```python
import importlib
import logging
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from functools import wraps
import random

# Setup Logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Strategy Decorator to keep track of performance
def track_performance(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        logging.info(f"Strategy: {func.__name__}, Performance: {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Load Module Dynamically
def load_strategy_module(module_name):
    module = importlib.import_module(module_name)
    return module

# Example of a recursive strategy
@track_performance
def recursive_strategy(depth, strategy_func):
    if depth <= 0:
        return 0
    # Simulate a strategy computation
    result = strategy_func(depth)
    logging.info(f"Depth: {depth}, Result: {result}")
    return result + recursive_strategy(depth-1, strategy_func)

# Simulate a strategy function
def sample_strategy(depth):
    return depth * random.random()

# Manage recursive process using ThreadPoolExecutor
def manage_recursive_autonomy(depth, strategy_func):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(recursive_strategy, depth, strategy_func)
                   for _ in range(3)]
        for future in futures:
            logging.info(f"Strategy Result: {future.result()}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Example Usage
    depth = 5
    module = load_strategy_module('my_strategy_module')  # Assuming a module is available
    manage_recursive_autonomy(depth, module.strategy_function)
```

### Expanding the Module:

1. **Machine Learning Integration**:
   - Integrate libraries like `scikit-learn` or `TensorFlow` to enable learning and anticipate future strategy performance.

2. **Plugin Architecture**:
   - Develop an interface for plugins where new strategy modules can be installed without modifying core logic.

3. **Web Dashboard**:
   - Use `Dash` or `Flask` for real-time dashboards that reflect system performance, logs, and predictions.

4. **Configuration Management**:
   - Manage configuration files using `configparser` or similar tools to easily adjust different parameters.
   
This design should help foster an adaptable autonomous system capable of evolving its strategies over time. Always keep scalability and modularity in mind as you expand functionality and add complexity.
