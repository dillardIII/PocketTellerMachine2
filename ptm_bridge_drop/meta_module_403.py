Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional term here) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves several key components. This includes a focus on intelligent automation, adaptive algorithms, and dynamic learning capabilities. Below is a conceptual design for such a module:

### Module Overview

The Python module, `ptm_autonomy.py`, will focus on creating a self-evolving system that leverages recursion to adapt and optimize its processes autonomously. The module will include functionalities for recursive learning, decision making, and system evolution.

```python
# ptm_autonomy.py

import random
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self, initial_data):
        """
        Initialize the autonomy stack with initial data.
        
        Args:
            initial_data (list): Starting dataset for the system.
        """
        self.data = initial_data
        self.strategy = self._initialize_strategy()

    def _initialize_strategy(self):
        """
        Initialize a base strategy for recursive operations.
        
        Returns:
            dict: A dictionary representing the initial strategy.
        """
        return {'operations': ['expand', 'mutate', 'prune'], 'threshold': 0.5}

    def evolve(self, depth=3):
        """
        Execute the recursive strategy to evolve the system.
        
        Args:
            depth (int): The recursion depth for evolution.
        """
        if depth <= 0:
            return

        logging.info(f"Evolution at depth {depth}")
        self._evaluate_and_execute_strategy(depth)
        self.evolve(depth - 1)

    def _evaluate_and_execute_strategy(self, current_depth):
        """
        Evaluate the strategy and execute based on current system state.
        
        Args:
            current_depth (int): The current depth of recursion.
        """
        operation = random.choice(self.strategy['operations'])
        logging.info(f"Executing operation {operation} at depth {current_depth}")

        if operation == 'expand':
            self.data.append(random.choice(range(100)))
        elif operation == 'mutate':
            if self.data:
                index = random.randint(0, len(self.data) - 1)
                self.data[index] = random.choice(range(100))
        elif operation == 'prune':
            if self.data:
                self.data.pop(random.randint(0, len(self.data) - 1))

        logging.debug(f"Data State: {self.data}")

    def optimize(self, criterion=lambda x: sum(x)/len(x) > 50):
        """
        Optimize the current state using the provided criterion.
        
        Args:
            criterion (function): A function to evaluate the condition for optimization.
        """
        logging.info("Optimizing current state")
        if criterion(self.data):
            self.strategy['threshold'] += 0.1

    def self_assess(self):
        """
        Self-assessment function to recalibrate strategy based on performance.
        """
        evaluation_score = sum(self.data) / len(self.data)
        logging.info(f"Self-assessment score: {evaluation_score}")

        if evaluation_score < self.strategy['threshold']:
            # Adjust strategy to enhance performance
            self.strategy['operations'].remove('prune')
            self.strategy['operations'].append('expand')

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    initial_data = [random.randint(0, 100) for _ in range(10)]
    stack = AutonomyStack(initial_data)
    
    stack.evolve(depth=5)
    stack.optimize()
    stack.self_assess()
```

### Features and Strategies

1. **Recursive Evolution**: The `evolve` method uses recursion to execute and adapt strategies at different depths, allowing for complex decision trees and adaptation mechanisms.

2. **Dynamic Strategy Adjustment**: Strategies are dynamically adjusted based on the system's self-assessment, ensuring that strategies continually improve.

3. **Data Management**: The module maintains and manipulates an internal dataset through operations like expanding, mutating, and pruning, allowing the system to respond to changing conditions.

4. **Optimization**: Uses criteria-driven optimization to ensure the system is always aiming towards better performance.

5. **Logging and Debugging**: Logs operations and system states for easier debugging and performance tracking.

This conceptual module serves as a starting point for building more advanced, real-world autonomous systems within the PTM empire, by continually learning and evolving through recursive strategies.
