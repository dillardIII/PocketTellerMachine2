Designing a new Python module to enhance the PTM (let's assume it stands for "Processing and Task Management") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating advanced recursive strategies and innovative machine learning methods. Below is a high-level design of such a module, which we'll call `AutonomyEnhancer`. This module emphasizes scalability, adaptability, and self-improvement over time.

### AutonomyEnhancer Module Design

1. **Module Purpose**:
   - Expand the self-evolving capabilities of the PTM empire's systems.
   - Enable recursive learning, decision-making, and optimization.

2. **Core Functionalities**:
   - **Recursive Learning Loop**: Implement recursive models that adapt based on feedback from the environment.
   - **Self-Optimization**: Continuously optimize performance metrics through evolutionary algorithms.
   - **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Use real-time data to make decisions that improve task efficiency and accuracy.
   - **Autonomous Task Management**: Automate task delegation and prioritization based on predictive insights.

3. **Key Components**:

   - **Data Processor**:
     - Handles data acquisition, cleaning, and transformation.
     - Facilitates recursive data augmentation to improve learning.

   - **Recursive Learning Engine**:
     - Implements machine learning models that learn from previous iterations.
     - Utilizes reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms for continuous improvement.

   - **Optimization Framework**:
     - Utilizes metaheuristics like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or particle swarm optimization to evolve solutions.
     - Self-tuning hyperparameters to adapt to dynamic task demands.

   - **Decision Support System**:
     - Integrates predictive models for strategic planning and logistics.
     - Implements Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) for sequential decision making.

   - **Feedback Loop**:
     - Continuously collects performance data and errors.
     - Updates models and strategies based on feedback and new insights.

   - **Interface Module**:
     - Provides APIs for integration with existing PTM systems.
     - Enables monitoring and human-in-the-loop supervision for critical decisions.

4. **Innovative Recursive Strategies**:

   - **Nested Recursive Models**:
     - Models within models that refine predictions at different abstraction levels.
     - Example: Recursive Neural Networks for tasks like multi-step forecasting.

   - **Evolvable Networks**:
     - Network architecture that self-modifies over time to improve learning capability.
     - Dynamic topology adjustments using neural architecture search.

   - **Self-Refinement Protocols**:
     - Continuous model refinement based on cross-validation performance and drift detection.
     - Implementing adversarial training to improve resilience and robustness.

5. **Implementation Plan**:

   - **Phase 1: Development**:
     - Establish baseline models and data pipelines.
     - Test recursive learning functionalities with synthetic datasets.

   - **Phase 2: Integration**:
     - Integrate with existing PTM systems.
     - Conduct pilot testing in controlled environments for initial feedback.

   - **Phase 3: Scaling and Enhancement**:
     - Deploy optimized models.
     - Scale system capabilities to handle increased workloads and more complex tasks.

6. **Sample Code Snippet**:

```python
class AutonomyEnhancer:
    def __init__(self, data_pipeline, model_builder):
        self.data_pipeline = data_pipeline
        self.model_builder = model_builder
        self.recursive_models = []

    def preprocess_data(self):
        return self.data_pipeline.process()

    def build_recursive_model(self, data):
        model = self.model_builder.build(data)
        self.recursive_models.append(model)

    def evolve(self):
        for model in self.recursive_models:
            # Implement recursive learning strategy
            model.learn()  

    def optimize(self):
        # Self-optimization logic
        pass

    def decide_and_execute(self):
        # Use decision support system to automate task execution
        pass

# Example usage
data_pipeline = DataPipeline()
model_builder = ModelBuilder()
autonomy_enhancer = AutonomyEnhancer(data_pipeline, model_builder)
data = autonomy_enhancer.preprocess_data()
autonomy_enhancer.build_recursive_model(data)
autonomy_enhancer.evolve()
autonomy_enhancer.decide_and_execute()
```

This module design provides a flexible framework for expanding the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack by integrating recursive learning techniques and evolving dynamically in response to new data and challenges.
