Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating advanced machine learning techniques, recursive strategies, and ensuring the system is both adaptive and scalable. Here's a conceptual outline and some code snippets to get you started:

### Conceptual Design

1. **Self-Evolving Architecture**: 
   - Utilize a combination of reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms to enable the system to evolve over time.
   - Implement meta-learning strategies to improve learning efficiency and adaptability.

2. **Recursive Strategy Implementation**:
   - Develop recursive decision-making processes that can adaptively refine strategies based on environmental feedback.
   - Utilize recursive neural networks (like RNNs or LSTMs) to manage time-dependent or sequential data inputs effectively.

3. **Modular and Scalable Code Architecture**:
   - Design the system in a modular fashion to facilitate easy updates and scaling.
   - Enable plug-and-play capabilities for testing different algorithms and components within the autonomy stack.

4. **Real-time Adaptiveness**:
   - Integrate real-time data processing and decision-making capabilities.
   - Implement anomaly detection and automated debugging to handle unexpected scenarios dynamically.

### Code Structure

Below is a simplified code structure to illustrate key components. This is a conceptual blueprint so adjustments will be needed for your specific applications.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, LSTM
from genetic_algorithm import GeneticAlgorithm  # Assume a custom genetic algorithm module
from reinforcement_learning import Agent  # Assume a custom RL agent module

class SelfEvolvingModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.meta_model = Sequential([
            LSTM(128, input_shape=(None, 10), return_sequences=True),
            Dense(64, activation='relu'),
            Dense(1)
        ])
        self.meta_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
        self.agent = Agent(state_size=10, action_size=5)
        self.genetic_algo = GeneticAlgorithm(pop_size=50)

    def recursive_strategy(self, state):
        # A recursive function to iteratively refine a decision strategy
        def refine(decision, iteration=0, max_iterations=10):
            if iteration > max_iterations:
                return decision
            feedback = self.get_environment_feedback(decision)
            improved_decision = self.improve_decision(decision, feedback)
            return refine(improved_decision, iteration + 1)

        initial_decision = self.agent.act(state)
        return refine(initial_decision)

    def improve_decision(self, decision, feedback):
        # Placeholder for a decision improvement mechanism
        return decision + feedback

    def get_environment_feedback(self, decision):
        # Placeholder for simulated environmental feedback
        return np.random.randn() * 0.1

    def evolve(self):
        # Use a genetic algorithm to evolve the models recently enhanced
        population = self.genetic_algo.initial_population(self.meta_model)
        best_model = self.genetic_algo.evolve(population, iterations=100)
        self.meta_model.set_weights(best_model.get_weights())

    def train(self, episodes=1000):
        for episode in range(episodes):
            state = self.get_initial_state()
            done = False
            while not done:
                decision = self.recursive_strategy(state)
                next_state, reward, done = self.take_action(decision)
                self.agent.learn(state, decision, reward, next_state, done)
                state = next_state
    
    def get_initial_state(self):
        return np.random.rand(10)

    def take_action(self, decision):
        # Placeholder for an environment interaction function
        next_state = np.random.rand(10)
        reward = np.random.randn()
        done = np.random.rand() > 0.95  # Random end condition
        return next_state, reward, done


# Initialize and use the module
if __name__ == '__main__':
    auto_module = SelfEvolvingModule()
    auto_module.train()
    auto_module.evolve()
```

### Key Considerations

- **Concurrency**: To handle real-time adaptiveness efficiently, consider incorporating multiprocessing where necessary.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement robust logging and monitoring to track system performance and debug effectively during development.
- **Security and Ethics**: Ensure data handling adheres to privacy regulations and ethical guidelines, particularly if this stack handles sensitive information.

This design encourages adaptability through recursive strategy refinement, evolution via genetic algorithms, and reinforcement learning for decision-making, creating a comprehensive framework for a self-evolving autonomous system.
