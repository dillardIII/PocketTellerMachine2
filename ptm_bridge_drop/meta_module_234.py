Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably Physical, Tactical, and Mental) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can support self-improvement and adaptation over time. This system should be able to assess its current performance, identify areas for improvement, and recursively enhance its strategies and capabilities.

Here's a blueprint for such a module with key elements and a high-level approach:

### Module Name: `ptm_self_optimizer`

#### Key Components:

1. **Autonomy Framework**:
   - A base structure to integrate different components of the PTM empire: Physical, Tactical, and Mental.

2. **Monitoring and Evaluation**:
   - Methods for continuous performance assessment of current strategies and techniques.

3. **Learning and adaptation strategies**:
   - Implementing machine learning techniques to facilitate learning from past experiences.
   - Incorporating reinforcement learning for real-time strategy adaptation.

4. **Recursive Strategy Enhancements**:
   - Algorithms to recursively improve existing strategies by identifying patterns and suggesting modifications.

5. **Simulation Environment**:
   - A controlled environment to test and refine new strategies before real-world deployment.

6. **Feedback Loop System**:
   - Establishing robust feedback mechanisms to ensure continuous data influx for learning.

7. **Integration and Scalability**:
   - Ensuring the module integrates with existing infrastructure and scales as the system grows.

### High-Level Functions:

```python
class PTMSelfOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialization of key components
        self.current_performance = {}
        self.history = []

    def monitor_and_evaluate(self):
        # Function to monitor current performance and evaluate results
        performance_data = self.collect_performance_data()
        self.current_performance = self.analyze_data(performance_data)
        return self.current_performance

    def collect_performance_data(self):
        # Hypothetical method to gather data on current system performance
        return {"success_rate": 0.8, "efficiency": 0.75, "errors": 3}

    def analyze_data(self, data):
        # Analyze data to assess current performance
        return {"assessment": "fine", "errors": data["errors"]}

    def learning_and_adaptation(self):
        # Apply machine learning and recursive strategies to enhance the stack
        improvements = self.recursive_strategy_analysis()
        self.apply_learning(improvements)

    def recursive_strategy_analysis(self):
        # Hypothetical approach to recursively analyze and enhance strategies
        improvements = {"success_rate": 0.85, "efficiency": 0.8}
        return improvements

    def apply_learning(self, improvements):
        # Apply identified improvements to current strategies
        self.current_performance.update(improvements)

    def run_simulation(self):
        # Simulate new strategies in a controlled environment
        simulation_results = self.simulate()
        self.evaluate_simulation(simulation_results)

    def simulate(self):
        # Hypothetical simulation process
        return {"success": True}

    def evaluate_simulation(self, results):
        # Evaluate results from the simulation
        if results["success"]:
            print("Simulation successful, integrating strategies.")
        else:
            print("Simulation failed, re-evaluating strategies.")

    def feedback_loop(self):
        # Implement feedback mechanism
        self.history.append(self.current_performance)

    def integrate_and_scale(self):
        # Ensure integration with existing infrastructure
        print("Integration complete, scaling the system.")
```

#### Innovation Elements:

- **Recursive Strategy Development**: Use recursive algorithms to uncover hidden insights and potentially incremental improvements with iterative re-evaluation.
  
- **Self-Evaluation Metrics**: Define self-evaluation metrics that trigger adaptation algorithms based on performance.

- **Neural Adaptive Learning**: Incorporate neural networks that focus on recursive strategy optimization directed by evolving goals.

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Research and Design**: Thoroughly research current PTM systems, user requirements, and future scalability.
2. **Prototyping & Testing**: Develop initial prototypes and test in close-to-real-world conditions.
3. **Feedback Incorporation**: Use field reports and testing data to refine and scale the solution.
4. **Iterative Development**: Continuously iterate on the system design and functionality as new insights are found.

This blueprint should act as a foundation for developing a competent self-evolving module, capable of recursively enhancing its operational strategies while maintaining alignment with the strategic goals of the PTM empire.
