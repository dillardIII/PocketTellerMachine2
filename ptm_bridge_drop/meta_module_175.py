Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably, Personalized Transportation Mechanism) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires careful consideration of several factors including flexibility, adaptability, efficient learning, and decision-making capabilities. Below is a conceptual design outline for such a module with innovative recursive strategies:

### Module Overview
The module, tentatively named `AutonomyEnhancer`, aims to improve vehicle autonomy by incorporating self-evolutionary algorithms and recursive learning techniques to enhance decision-making and adaptability.

### Key Features
1. **Recursive Mission Planning**: Utilize recursion to break down and solve larger mission objectives into manageable sub-goals. This can help in dynamically adjusting plans based on situational variance.
   
2. **Self-Evolutionary Algorithm**: Implement Genetic Algorithms or Evolutionary Strategies that allow the module to improve its own algorithms over time based on performance metrics.

3. **Behavioral Cloning with Feedback Loops**: Use imitation learning to clone the behaviors of expert drivers, then recursively refine these behaviors using feedback-based adjustments.

4. **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**: Enable collaboration between multiple agents (vehicles), utilizing recursive strategies to optimize overall system performance.

5. **Error Propagation Analysis**: Implement recursive methods to predict and correct potential error propagation throughout the decision-making pipeline.

### Component Breakdown

#### 1. **Recursive Mission Planning**
```python
class MissionPlanner:
    def __init__(self, mission_objective):
        self.mission_objective = mission_objective

    def plan(self, current_state, objective=None):
        if objective is None:
            objective = self.mission_objective
        # Base case: If the objective is simple enough, execute it
        if self.is_simple(objective):
            return self.execute(objective, current_state)
        # Recursive case: Break down the objective into sub-goals
        sub_goals = self.decompose(objective)
        results = []
        for sub_goal in sub_goals:
            result = self.plan(current_state, sub_goal)
            results.append(result)
        return self.aggregate_results(results)

    # Additional helper methods (is_simple, execute, decompose, aggregate_results)
```

#### 2. **Self-Evolutionary Algorithm**
```python
from genetic_algorithm import GeneticAlgorithm

class SelfEvolver:
    def __init__(self, population_size, mutation_rate):
        self.ga = GeneticAlgorithm(population_size, mutation_rate)

    def evolve_strategy(self, performance_metric):
        self.ga.evaluate_population(performance_metric)
        self.ga.selection()
        self.ga.crossover()
        self.ga.mutate()
        return self.ga.get_best_solution()
```

#### 3. **Behavioral Cloning with Feedback Loops**
```python
class BehavioralCloner:
    def __init__(self, expert_data):
        self.model = self.train_initial_model(expert_data)

    def improve_model(self, feedback):
        # Recursive model improvement using feedback
        refined_data = self.integrate_feedback(feedback)
        self.model = self.train_initial_model(refined_data)

    def integrate_feedback(self, feedback):
        # Method to integrate real-world feedback into the training data
        return updated_data
```

#### 4. **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**
```python
from marl import MultiAgentEnvironment

class MARLEnhancer:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        self.env = MultiAgentEnvironment(agents)

    def coordinate_agents(self):
        while not self.env.is_terminal():
            for agent in self.env.agents:
                action = agent.select_action(self.env.state)
                reward, next_state = self.env.step(agent, action)
                agent.learn(reward, next_state)
``` 

#### 5. **Error Propagation Analysis**
```python
class ErrorAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, system_model):
        self.system_model = system_model

    def analyze_errors(self, input_data):
        # Recursive analysis to predict and correct errors
        if self.is_terminal_depth(input_data):
            return self.correct_errors(input_data)
        else:
            refined_data = self.refine_data(input_data)
            return self.analyze_errors(refined_data)
```

### Conclusion
The `AutonomyEnhancer` module attempts to improve vehicle autonomy by integrating innovative recursion-based strategies into key aspects such as mission planning, evolutionary algorithm development, behavioral refinement, multi-agent coordination, and error analysis. This modular design facilitates scalable and adaptable autonomy solutions for the PTM empire. Further enhancement can be achieved by integrating real-world testing and continuous refinement based on performance data.
