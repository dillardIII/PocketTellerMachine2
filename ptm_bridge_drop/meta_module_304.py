Creating a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably a fictional entity, such as "Potential Technological Mastery" or "Personal Transportation Machine") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies requires a systematic approach. Here's a hypothetical design that could serve such a purpose:

```python
"""
    PTM_Empire_Autonomy_Stack
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    This module is an integral part of the PTM Empire's advanced self-evolving
    autonomy stack. It employs recursive strategies and machine learning for
    adaptation and self-optimization in dynamic environments.

    Features:
    - Recursive Neural Architecture Search
    - Adaptive Planning with Feedback Loops
    - Self-healing AI Strategies

### Key Components:

1. **Recursive Neural Network (RNN) Architecture**: 
   - Recursive layer stacking to increase model depth dynamically based on requirements.
   - Recursive architectures help in developing more complex feature hierarchies.

2. **Adaptive Planner**:
   - Implements a feedback loop to continuously adapt plans based on environmental feedback.
   - Uses historical feedback to make informed decisions on balancing exploration vs. exploitation.

3. **Self-Healing AI**:
   - Monitors system state to detect anomalies.
   - Initiates self-recovery procedures to maintain operational status.

### Innovation:
- Leverages recursive functions and layers to facilitate growth and learning.
- Incorporates continuous environmental interaction through feedback loops for dynamic adaptation.
- Provides a self-healing mechanism to rectify anomalies and ensure stability.

### Future Enhancements:
- Incorporate memory-based learning for better historical context.
- Integrate with more advanced anomaly detection techniques using unsupervised learning.
- Expand feedback loop mechanisms with reinforcement learning for better adaptation over time.

This design outline reflects a multi-disciplinary approach combining neural networks, planning algorithms, and system integrity checks to enhance the autonomy of technology systems.
