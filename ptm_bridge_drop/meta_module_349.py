Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably referring to Parametric Technology Module, the acronym could vary) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires careful planning. We'll incorporate innovative recursive strategies to ensure adaptability and resilience. Below is a high-level design for such a module. Note that the specifics can be modified based on exact project requirements and the existing architecture of the PTM's autonomy stack.

### Module: `self_evolver`

#### Overview
The `self_evolver` module is designed to enable the PTM system to autonomously learn, adapt, and optimize its performance over time. This will be achieved by implementing recursive strategies that leverage feedback loops, data analysis, and machine learning algorithms.

#### Key Features

1. **Learning Engine**: A component that uses machine learning to analyze historical and real-time data, identifying patterns, and suggesting optimizations.
   
2. **Recursive Feedback Loop**: Continuously refines strategies and models based on new data, similar to how biological systems evolve.

3. **Strategy Optimizer**: Automatically tests multiple strategies, selecting and evolving the most effective ones.

4. **Self-Monitoring**: Monitors system performance to trigger adaptations when anomalies are detected.

5. **Interoperability Interface**: Ensures seamless integration with existing PTM modules and external systems.

#### Architecture

1. **Data Collector**:
   - Responsible for gathering data from diverse sources within the PTM ecosystem.

2. **Analyzer**:
   - Uses statistical methods and machine learning to derive insights and identify areas for improvement.

3. **Adaptive Controller**:
   - Adjusts parameters and strategies based on insights from the Analyzer.

4. **Evolutionary Optimizer**:
   - Employs genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning to iteratively refine system configurations.

5. **Communicator**:
   - Interfaces with other modules to ensure coordinated efforts and knowledge sharing.

6. **Logger**:
   - Records all data, decisions, and outcomes for transparency and further analysis.

#### Sample Implementation

```python
class SelfEvolver:
    def __init__(self, data_sources):
        self.data_sources = data_sources
        self.models = {}  # Stores learning models
        self.results = {}  # Stores strategy outcomes

    def collect_data(self):
        # Placeholder for data collection logic
        data = []
        for source in self.data_sources:
            data.append(source.fetch_data())
        return data

    def analyze(self, data):
        # Perform analysis using machine learning models
        insights = []
        for model_name, model in self.models.items():
            predictions = model.predict(data)
            insights.append(self.evaluate(predictions))
        return insights

    def evaluate(self, predictions):
        # Evaluate predictions to extract actionable insights
        return sum(predictions) / len(predictions)  # Simplified example

    def adjust_parameters(self, insights):
        # Implement strategy adjustments
        for insight in insights:
            if insight < THRESHOLD:
                self.evolve_strategy()

    def evolve_strategy(self):
        # Recursive strategy evolution using genetic algorithms
        # Placeholder for a more complex implementation
        new_strategy = self.create_new_strategy()
        self.results[new_strategy] = self.test_strategy(new_strategy)

    def create_new_strategy(self):
        # Placeholder to create a new strategy
        return "new_strategy"

    def test_strategy(self, strategy):
        # Placeholder to test and record the performance of a strategy
        return {"success": True, "performance": 95}

    def run(self):
        while True:
            data = self.collect_data()
            insights = self.analyze(data)
            self.adjust_parameters(insights)
            # Pause or delay can be added here for practical implementations

# Example of use
data_sources = []  # Populate with actual data sources
evolver = SelfEvolver(data_sources)
evolver.run()
```

#### Future Extensions

- **Enhanced Data Analytics**: Incorporate advanced data analytics with deep learning models.
  
- **Distributed Architecture**: Implement a distributed system to scale the self-evolving capabilities across multiple nodes.

- **Security Protocols**: Strengthen security features to protect the system's learning algorithms and data integrity.

This module should offer a robust starting point for developing a self-evolving autonomy stack within the PTM ecosystem. Tailor the exact algorithms and methodologies based on specific project goals.
