Certainly! Designing a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably "Planetary Transport Module" or similar) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies is quite an exciting challenge. Here is a conceptual outline and code sketch that focuses on recursive strategies for decision-making, optimization, and self-improvement.

### Module Overview

The module, named `AutoEvo`, will consist of several key components:

1. **Recursive Learning System (RLS)**: Implements recursive machine learning to iteratively refine models and strategies.
2. **Autonomous Decision-Maker (ADM)**: Utilizes recursive decision trees and reinforcement learning for real-time decision-making.
3. **Self-Optimizing Algorithms (SOA)**: Employs recursive function optimization to improve operational efficiency continuously.
4. **Simulation and Feedback Loop (SFL)**: A recursive feedback loop system to simulate outcomes and train models in a controlled environment.

### `AutoEvo` Module Design

```python
# autoevo/__init__.py

# Imports
import numpy as np
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from scipy.optimize import minimize
import random

# Recursive Learning System
class RecursiveLearningSystem:
    def __init__(self, model, data, labels):
        self.model = model
        self.data = data
        self.labels = labels

    def train(self, iterations=10):
        for i in range(iterations):
            self.model.fit(self.data, self.labels)
            predictions = self.model.predict(self.data)
            # Simulate learning: simple recursive adjustment of data
            self.data = self._recursive_data_adjust(predictions)
            print(f"Iteration {i+1}: Model trained with recursive data adjustment.")

    def _recursive_data_adjust(self, predictions):
        # Simple simulation of recursive data adjustment
        adjustment = np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=0.1, size=self.data.shape)
        return self.data + adjustment * (self.labels - predictions.reshape(-1, 1))

# Autonomous Decision-Maker
class AutonomousDecisionMaker:
    def __init__(self, rewards):
        self.rewards = rewards
        self.policy = self._initialize_policy()

    def decision(self, state):
        # Simple recursive decision-making strategy
        if random.random() > 0.5:
            decision = self.policy[state]
            print(f"Decision made: {decision}")
            return decision
        else:
            print("Exploration enabled, evaluating new state.")
            return self._recursive_decision(state)

    def _recursive_decision(self, state):
        # Example recursion logic to explore new decisions
        return max(range(len(self.rewards[state])), key=lambda i: self.rewards[state][i])

    def _initialize_policy(self):
        return {state: random.choice(range(len(self.rewards[state]))) for state in self.rewards}

# Self-Optimizing Algorithms
class SelfOptimizingAlgorithm:
    def __init__(self, objective_function):
        self.objective_function = objective_function

    def optimize(self, initial_guess, iteration=5):
        result = initial_guess
        for _ in range(iteration):
            result = minimize(self.objective_function, result, method='BFGS').x
            print(f"Optimized to: {result}")
        return result

# Simulation and Feedback Loop
class SimulationFeedbackLoop:
    def __init__(self, model, environment):
        self.model = model
        self.environment = environment

    def run(self, episodes=50):
        for episode in range(episodes):
            state = self.environment.reset()
            done = False
            while not done:
                action = self.model.decision(state)
                next_state, reward, done, _ = self.environment.step(action)
                state = next_state
                # Recursive feedback loop: update environment based on model performance
                self.model.rewards[state] += reward
                print(f"Episode {episode+1}: Model updated with reward feedback.")

# Sample Usage (Would require datasets and environment definition)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Dummy data for illustration
    training_data = np.random.rand(100, 5)
    training_labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

    # RLS Example
    rls = RecursiveLearningSystem(DecisionTreeClassifier(), training_data, training_labels)
    rls.train()

    # ADM Example
    adm = AutonomousDecisionMaker(rewards={0: [1, 2], 1: [3, 4]})
    adm.decision(0)

    # SOA Example
    def objective_function(x):
        return x**2

    soa = SelfOptimizingAlgorithm(objective_function)
    soa.optimize(initial_guess=np.array([10]))

    # SFL Example
    # Assuming a 'mock_environment' class with appropriate methods is defined
    # sfl = SimulationFeedbackLoop(adm, mock_environment)
    # sfl.run()
```

### Key Components Explained:

- **Recursive Learning System (RLS)**: Incorporates a simple recursive approach to adjust data after each training iteration.
- **Autonomous Decision-Maker (ADM)**: Uses a rudimentary policy-based recursive exploration strategy for decision making.
- **Self-Optimizing Algorithms (SOA)**: Minimizes a given objective function recursively through iterative improvements.
- **Simulation and Feedback Loop (SFL)**: Creates a feedback-driven learning environment, potentially simulating real-time environmental interaction.

This module is designed as a conceptual start point and needs to be further tailored with specific domain knowledge, datasets, and environment configurations to effectively expand the PTM empireâ€™s autonomy stack.
