Designing a new Python module for expanding the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves incorporating cutting-edge strategies, particularly focusing on recursive capabilities and self-improvement. The goal is to enhance the autonomous system's ability to learn, adapt, and optimize its performance over time. Here's a conceptual outline with some implementation details:

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Structure:

1. **Core Components:**
   - **AutonomyEngine:** The main class responsible for managing the self-evolving strategies.
   - **RecursiveLearning:** A class dedicated to implementing recursive learning algorithms.
   - **EvolutionManager:** Handles dynamic adaptation and optimization of strategies.
   - **FeedbackLoop:** Manages feedback from the environment to guide learning processes.

2. **Innovative Features:**
   - Recursive neural networks (RNN) and attention mechanisms.
   - Genetic algorithms for evolving strategies.
   - Reinforcement learning (RL) with self-improvement cycles.
   - Continuous integration of new data for real-time adaptation.

#### Key Classes and Methods:

```python
# ptm_autonomy/core.py

class AutonomyEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.recursive_model = RecursiveLearning()
        self.evolution_manager = EvolutionManager()
        self.feedback_loop = FeedbackLoop()

    def start(self):
        # Initiates the autonomy stack
        self.recursive_model.initialize()
        self.feedback_loop.start()
        self.evolution_manager.optimize()

    def run_cycle(self):
        # Executes a cycle of learning, adaptation, and feedback
        self.recursive_model.evolve()
        feedback = self.feedback_loop.collect()
        self.recursive_model.update(feedback)
        self.evolution_manager.mutate()

class RecursiveLearning:
    def initialize(self):
        # Setup initial neural networks and parameters
        pass

    def evolve(self):
        # Applies recursive learning algorithm
        pass

    def update(self, feedback):
        # Update models based on feedback
        pass

class EvolutionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.population = []

    def optimize(self):
        # Optimize strategy using genetic algorithms
        pass

    def mutate(self):
        # Mutate strategies to introduce novelty
        pass

class FeedbackLoop:
    def start(self):
        # Initiate feedback collection from environment
        pass

    def collect(self):
        # Collect and return feedback data
        return {}

# Example script to use the module

if __name__ == "__main__":
    engine = AutonomyEngine()
    engine.start()

    while True:
        engine.run_cycle()
```

#### Key Design Considerations:

- **Modularity:** Each component is independent, allowing for easy upgrades and maintenance.
- **Scalability:** The system can handle increasing complexity as it evolves.
- **Flexibility:** Integration of various AI models and strategies is straightforward.
- **Real-time Adaptation:** Continuous learning and adaptation to changing environments and data.

#### Recursive Strategies:

1. **Recursive Learning:**
   - Implement a custom RNN-based approach, potentially combined with attention mechanisms, to allow the system to handle sequential dependencies and learn complex hierarchical patterns.

2. **Evolutionary Algorithms:**
   - Use genetic algorithms for evolving the strategy pool. Implement mutation, crossover, and selection processes to explore the strategy space efficiently.

3. **Multi-Agent Coordination:**
   - Consider integrating multiple agents that can learn and adapt collaboratively, using shared feedback to adjust their strategies.

4. **Self-Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Deploy a suite of internal metrics to gauge performance improvement and identify areas for optimization dynamically.

This module represents a sophisticated approach to self-evolving autonomy within the PTM empire, focusing on iterative improvement and adaptive intelligence. Implementing it would require thorough testing, robust error handling, and careful tuning to meet real-world demands.
