Creating a new Python module to expand the autonomous capabilities of a system like the PTM (Presumably a sort of AI or robotics system) involves designing software architecture that can adapt and evolve, learning from its environment. The focus on innovative recursive strategies suggests a need for algorithms that can repeatedly refine themselves over time.

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Key Features
1. **Recursive Learning Agents**: The module implements agents that can learn by recursive function calls, allowing them to improve their decision-making strategies over time.

2. **Self-Optimization Algorithms**: Incorporates genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning methods to enable continuous self-improvement.

3. **Environment Interaction**: Provides interfaces for agents to interact with both simulated and real-world environments, collecting data to refine their models.

4. **Modular Architecture**: Designed to be extensible, allowing new algorithms or sensors to be added without disrupting existing functionality.

5. **Simulation and Testing Tools**: Includes tools to simulate various scenarios and test the evolving strategies in a safe environment.

6. **Feedback Loops for Adaptivity**: Utilizes feedback mechanisms to adjust parameters dynamically based on performance metrics.

Here's a basic implementation plan for `ptm_autonomy`:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import random
from typing import Any, Tuple, List

# Core module class
class PTMAutonomy:
    def __init__(self, environment: Any):
        self.environment = environment
        self.agent = AdaptiveAgent(self.environment)

    def run(self, iterations: int = 1000):
        for iteration in range(iterations):
            state = self.environment.get_current_state()
            action = self.agent.get_action(state)
            reward, next_state = self.environment.execute_action(action)
            self.agent.learn(state, action, reward, next_state)

# Adaptive agent class implementing recursive strategy learning
class AdaptiveAgent:
    def __init__(self, environment: Any):
        self.environment = environment
        self.q_table = {}
        self.alpha = 0.1  # Learning rate
        self.gamma = 0.9  # Discount factor
        self.epsilon = 0.1  # Exploration rate

    def get_action(self, state: Tuple) -> Any:
        if random.uniform(0, 1) < self.epsilon:  
            # Explore
            return self.environment.sample_action()
        else:
            # Exploit
            return self.best_action(state)

    def best_action(self, state: Tuple) -> Any:
        if state not in self.q_table:
            return self.environment.sample_action()
        return max(self.q_table[state], key=self.q_table[state].get)

    def learn(self, state: Tuple, action: Any, reward: float, next_state: Tuple):
        if state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[state] = {}
        if action not in self.q_table[state]:
            self.q_table[state][action] = 0

        future_reward = 0 if next_state not in self.q_table else max(self.q_table[next_state].values())
        
        # Update Q-value using the Bellman equation
        current_q = self.q_table[state][action]
        updated_q = (1 - self.alpha) * current_q + self.alpha * (reward + self.gamma * future_reward)
        self.q_table[state][action] = updated_q

# Example usage with a dummy environment
class DummyEnvironment:
    def get_current_state(self) -> Tuple:
        # Dummy state
        return (0,)

    def sample_action(self) -> Any:
        # Return a random action
        return random.choice(['action1', 'action2', 'action3'])

    def execute_action(self, action: Any) -> Tuple[float, Tuple]:
        # Execute action and return dummy reward and new state
        return (random.random(), (0,))

# Define entry point
if __name__ == "__main__":
    environment = DummyEnvironment()
    ptm_system = PTMAutonomy(environment)
    ptm_system.run()

```

### Explanation 

- **PTMAutonomy Class**: Manages the overall operation, coordinating between the environment and the agent, running through specified iterations.
  
- **AdaptiveAgent Class**: Implements a Q-learning algorithm that evolves strategies based on rewards received from the environment.

- **Recursive Learning**: Not explicitly recursive in function calls but recursive in learning methodology, where each learning iteration refines future actions based on historical data.
  
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: The loop of observation, action selection, and learning creates a feedback loop to continuously fine-tune strategies.

- **DummyEnvironment**: Placeholder for a real or simulated environment to interact with.

This design template is a fundamental framework for expansion, supporting innovations in recursive and self-evolving autonomy strategies. You can add more sophisticated mechanisms like neural networks, advanced simulations, and complex environment interactions to further evolve capabilities.
