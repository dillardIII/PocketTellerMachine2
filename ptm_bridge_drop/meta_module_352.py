Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Potentially a fictional or hypothetical term) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires careful consideration of innovative recursive strategies, as well as principles from machine learning, artificial intelligence, and software design. The goal would be to enhance self-learning, adaptability, and efficient resource management. Below is a conceptual design and implementation outline for such a module.

### Module Overview: `autonomy_evolver`

This module, `autonomy_evolver`, aims to facilitate autonomous, recursive self-improvement through machine learning strategies, meta-learning, and system-wide adaptability. It introduces recursive strategies that involve learning not just from data but also from the learning process itself.

#### Key Features
1. **Recursive Meta-Learning**: Leveraging meta-learning algorithms to improve the learning process over iterations.
2. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate computational resources.
3. **Scalable Model Architectures**: Architectures capable of adjusting their complexity based on task demands.
4. **Self-Diagnosis and Adaptation**: Mechanisms to identify inefficiencies and autonomously adapt algorithms and parameters.

### Conceptual Classes and Methods

```python
# autonomy_evolver.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from typing import Callable, List, Tuple

class MetaLearner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = []
        self.evolution_history = []
    
    def add_model(self, model):
        """Add a new model to the ensemble"""
        self.models.append(model)
    
    def evolve(self, X, y, strategy: Callable):
        """Evolve models based on a given strategy"""
        scores = [model.evaluate(X, y) for model in self.models]
        best_score = max(scores)
        best_model = self.models[scores.index(best_score)]
        
        # Apply a recursive learning strategy
        new_model = strategy(best_model)
        self.evolution_history.append(new_model)
        self.add_model(new_model)
        
        return new_model

    def evaluate_models(self, X, y):
        """Evaluate all models and return their accuracy."""
        results = {model: model.evaluate(X, y) for model in self.models}
        return results

class AutoModel:
    def __init__(self, clf=GaussianNB()):
        self.clf = clf
        self.training_history = []
        
    def train(self, X, y):
        """Train the model on the provided data"""
        X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
        self.clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
        accuracy = self.evaluate(X_valid, y_valid)
        self.training_history.append(accuracy)
        
    def evaluate(self, X, y):
        """Evaluate the model on the provided data"""
        return self.clf.score(X, y)

def recursive_strategy(base_model: AutoModel) -> AutoModel:
    """Example strategy: slightly tweak the model hyperparameters."""
    # Hypothetical implementation to slightly mutate a model
    mutated_clf = GaussianNB()  # Replace with a better strategy for real use
    new_model = AutoModel(clf=mutated_clf)
    return new_model

# Example of usage
meta_learner = MetaLearner()
initial_model = AutoModel()

# Train an initial model
X, y = np.random.rand(100, 10), np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
initial_model.train(X, y)

meta_learner.add_model(initial_model)

# Evolve the model
new_model = meta_learner.evolve(X, y, strategy=recursive_strategy)
```

### Recursive Strategy Design
The `recursive_strategy` function serves as a placeholder for a sophisticated algorithm designed to evolve the AI model. Real implementations might include:
- Genetic algorithms for hyperparameter tuning.
- Reinforcement learning to adapt models based on performance feedback.
- Neural architecture search to optimize structural aspects of the model.

### Considerations

1. **Scalability**: Ensure the module supports distributed computing to handle large-scale data and model complexity.
2. **Interoperability**: Design the module to integrate seamlessly with existing tools and platforms within the PTM empire's infrastructure.
3. **Security and Ethics**: Implement robust security measures to prevent undesired behavior, and include checks for ethical considerations in autonomy.

By incorporating these innovative strategies, the `autonomy_evolver` module can help the PTM empire's autonomy stack to not just function with high efficiency but also to improve itself autonomously over time.
