Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably, a fictional or hypothetical entity) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves several key components. Given the scope, this module should incorporate machine learning, data processing, feedback loops, and recursive strategies to achieve full autonomy and adaptability. Here's an outline and a simplified version of what this module could look like, focusing on modularity, adaptability, and recursive strategies.

### Module Overview

The module, let's call it `AutonomyStack`, should consist of the following components:

1. **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**: Collects and processes data from various sensors or inputs.
2. **Learning Algorithms**: Utilizes machine learning techniques to evolve and adapt its strategies.
3. **Feedback Loops**: Implements feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement.
4. **Recursive Strategies**: Employs recursive methods for decision-making and learning.
5. **Adaptation and Evolution**: Adapts models and strategies based on environmental changes or new data.

### Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Each component can be independently developed, upgraded, or replaced.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a large and diverse set of inputs.
- **Self-Evolution**: Ability to learn and evolve from new data without human intervention.
- **Robustness**: Capable of operating under a wide range of conditions and adapting strategies as needed.

### Example Code for the Module

Here's a simplified version of what such a module might look like in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_layers=(100,), activation='relu'):
        self.scaler = StandardScaler()
        self.model = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=hidden_layers, activation=activation)
        self.input_size = input_size
    
    def preprocess_data(self, data):
        """ Preprocess input data: scaling, normalization, etc. """
        data = np.array(data)
        if data.shape[1] != self.input_size:
            raise ValueError("Input data shape mismatch.")
        
        # Standardize features
        data = self.scaler.fit_transform(data)
        return data
    
    def learn(self, inputs, targets):
        """ Train the model using recursive learning """
        inputs = self.preprocess_data(inputs)
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(inputs, targets, test_size=0.2)
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        score = self.model.score(X_test, y_test)
        print(f"Model trained. Initial performance: {score}")
        
        # Recursive strategy: Retrain on new data until improvement stabilizes
        last_score = score
        while True:
            self.model.partial_fit(X_train, y_train)
            current_score = self.model.score(X_test, y_test)
            print(f"Recursive improvement: {current_score}")
            if abs(current_score - last_score) < 0.001:
                break
            last_score = current_score
    
    def predict(self, new_inputs):
        """ Make predictions using the trained model """
        new_inputs = self.preprocess_data(new_inputs)
        return self.model.predict(new_inputs)
    
    def feedback_loop(self, feedback_data):
        """ Incorporate feedback data to improve model performance """
        inputs, targets = feedback_data
        self.learn(inputs, targets)

# Potential usage:
# data = ...  # Some data acquisition process
# targets = ...  # Target values for supervised learning
# stack = AutonomyStack(input_size=data.shape[1])
# stack.learn(data, targets)
# predictions = stack.predict(new_inputs)
# stack.feedback_loop(feedback_data)  # Continuously enhance model with new data points
```

### Considerations

- **Safety and Security**: When designing autonomous systems, it’s crucial to include checks and balances to prevent unintended behavior.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that data privacy standards are maintained, especially if processing personal data.
- **Ethical Concerns**: Developing autonomous systems has ethical implications that must be considered, such as decision-making processes and transparency.

This template provides a basic structure targeting recursive learning and adaptability. Depending on the specific requirements of the PTM empire’s autonomy goals, more sophisticated models, such as Reinforcement Learning or Generative models, might be integrated for enhanced functionality.
