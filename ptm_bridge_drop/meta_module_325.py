Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional organization for the context of this question) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating advanced AI techniques, particularly in recursive and self-improving strategies. Below is an outline and sample code to get started on such a module. This design assumes familiarity with advanced machine learning and autonomous systems concepts.

### Module: `autonomy_stack`

#### Key Features:
1. **Recursive Self-Improvement**: A system that can evaluate its own performance and make incremental improvements.
2. **Hierarchical Learning**: Multiple layers of decision-making processes that contribute to a global goal.
3. **Algorithmic Diversity**: Using multiple machine learning algorithms to solve different aspects of the problem.
4. **Autonomous Evaluation**: Built-in evaluation mechanisms to benchmark progress and recalibrate strategies.
5. **Scalability**: Designed to integrate easily with other modules and expand functionality as needed.

#### Structure:

1. **RecursiveLearner**: Base class for implementing recursive learning strategies.
2. **LearningAgent**: Implements various algorithms and autonomously selects the best one.
3. **PerformanceEvaluator**: Continuous evaluation to provide feedback for self-improvement.
4. **StrategyOptimizer**: Adjusts the tactics based on performance feedback.

Here's a simplified outline of how the module might look like in Python:

```python
# autonomy_stack/__init__.py
from .recursive_learner import RecursiveLearner
from .learning_agent import LearningAgent
from .performance_evaluator import PerformanceEvaluator
from .strategy_optimizer import StrategyOptimizer

# autonomy_stack/recursive_learner.py
class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []
    
    def learn(self, data):
        """Recursive learning process."""
        # Implement domain-specific logic to learn and adapt.
        improvement = self.self_improve(data)
        self.history.append(improvement)
    
    def self_improve(self, data):
        # Recursive logic for self-improvement.
        raise NotImplementedError("Implement logic for recursive improvement.")

# autonomy_stack/learning_agent.py
class LearningAgent(RecursiveLearner):
    def __init__(self, algorithms):
        super().__init__()
        self.algorithms = algorithms  # Assumed list of algorithms passed in.
    
    def choose_algorithm(self):
        """Choose the best algorithm based on some criteria."""
        # Implement logic to evaluate and choose appropriate algorithm.
    
    def self_improve(self, data):
        # Use different algorithms for recursive improvement.
        self.choose_algorithm()
        # Simulate learning.
        return "improvement_metric"

# autonomy_stack/performance_evaluator.py
class PerformanceEvaluator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = []

    def evaluate(self, learner):
        """Evaluate performance of the learner."""
        # Implement evaluating logic and feedback loop.
        metric = self.assess(learner.history)
        self.metrics.append(metric)

    def assess(self, history):
        # Calculate performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, speed).
        return sum(history) / len(history)

# autonomy_stack/strategy_optimizer.py
class StrategyOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, evaluator):
        self.evaluator = evaluator

    def optimize(self, agent):
        """Optimize strategy based on performance evaluation."""
        # Logic to optimize learner's strategy based on feedback.
        latest_metric = self.evaluator.metrics[-1]
        print(f"Optimizing strategy based on metric: {latest_metric}")
```

#### Recursive Strategy:
The recursive strategy in this module comes from `RecursiveLearner`, where a self-improvement mechanism allows the module to iteratively adjust its underlying algorithms and strategies based on the results of the previous iterations. This involves multiple evaluations using the `PerformanceEvaluator`, feeding back into the learning process, and optimizing the strategy using the `StrategyOptimizer`.

### Integration:
This module is designed to be flexible and integrous to the existing system of the PTM empire, waiting to be expanded with more complex decision-making logic and more sophisticated algorithms or learning strategies.

You would populate domain-specific implementations for each class method to address the specific needs of the PTM empire’s autonomy stack.
