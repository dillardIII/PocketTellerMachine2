Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably, an entity focused on autonomous systems) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack necessitates incorporating advanced strategies for recursive learning, decision-making, and adaptation. Below, I'll outline a conceptual design for such a module, which I'll call `AdaptiveRecursiveLearning` (ARL).

### Module: AdaptiveRecursiveLearning (ARL)

#### Main Objectives:
1. **Self-Evolution**: Continuously improve the system's performance through iterative learning processes.
2. **Recursive Learning**: Implement strategies that leverage recursive algorithms for enhanced decision-making.
3. **Adaptation**: Enable the system to adapt to changing conditions and unforeseen challenges.

#### Core Components:
1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**: Efficient gathering and processing of data from various sensors and sources.
2. **Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Utilize RNNs for handling sequential data and time-series predictions.
3. **Recursive Decision Trees**: Implement decision-making structures that adapt over iterations through learning.
4. **Self-Evolving Algorithms**: Algorithms that refine themselves based on feedback loops and performance metrics.
5. **Adaptive Mechanisms**: Strategies for adapting the autonomy stack based on collected data and evolving conditions.

#### Pseudocode Outline

Below is a framework for what such a Python module could look like:

```python
class AdaptiveRecursiveLearning:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_sources = []
        self.model = None
        self.decision_tree = None
        self.learning_rate = 0.01

    def add_data_source(self, source):
        """Add a new data source to the system."""
        self.data_sources.append(source)

    def preprocess_data(self, data):
        """Perform necessary data preprocessing steps."""
        # Implement preprocessing logic (e.g., normalization, scaling)
        processed_data = ... 
        return processed_data

    def initialize_model(self):
        """Initialize the recursive neural network model."""
        from keras.models import Sequential
        from keras.layers import SimpleRNN, Dense

        self.model = Sequential()
        self.model.add(SimpleRNN(50, input_shape=(None, 1)))
        self.model.add(Dense(1, activation='linear'))
        self.model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

    def train_model(self, training_data, training_labels):
        """Train the RNN model on given data."""
        data = self.preprocess_data(training_data)
        self.model.fit(data, training_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=1)

    def update_decision_tree(self, feedback):
        """Recursively update decision tree based on feedback."""
        # Logic to adapt and expand decision tree with new feedback
        self.decision_tree = ...  # Update the tree structure
    
    def self_evolve(self):
        """Self-evolve the autonomy stack components based on performance."""
        # Analyze performance
        performance_metrics = ...  # Placeholder for performance evaluation
        
        # If performance is below expectation, modify learning parameters
        if performance_metrics < predetermined_threshold:
            self.learning_rate *= 1.1  # Example strategy: increase learning rate

        # Update model weights, feedback loops, etc.
        # Retrain or adjust decision tree if necessary

    def make_decision(self, input_data):
        """Make a system decision based on current model and tree."""
        preprocessed_data = self.preprocess_data(input_data)
        
        # Predictive decision from RNN model
        prediction = self.model.predict(preprocessed_data)
        
        # Decision based on recursive decision tree
        decision = ...  # Implement decision logic based on tree
        
        return decision

if __name__ == "__main__":
    arl = AdaptiveRecursiveLearning()
    arl.add_data_source("sensor_data_1")
    arl.initialize_model()
    arl.train_model(training_data, training_labels)
    decision = arl.make_decision(input_data)
    arl.self_evolve()
```

#### Innovative Recursive Strategies

1. **Feedback Loops**: Implement tightly coupled feedback mechanisms, allowing the system to learn from its actions and adjust the models or decision-making trees accordingly.
2. **Continual Learning**: Allow ongoing model updates without needing complete retraining, using strategies like transfer learning and online learning.
3. **Meta-Learning**: Incorporate techniques where the model learns how to learn. This can improve adaptability across different environments or tasks.

This module is a conceptual starting point and would require robust testing and iteration to ensure its effectiveness in real-world applications. Integration with existing frameworks and systems within the PTM empire should also be considered.
