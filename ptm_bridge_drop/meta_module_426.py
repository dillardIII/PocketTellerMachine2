Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional or context-specific term here) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can learn from past experiences, adapt to new situations, and optimize its performance over time. Here is a conceptual framework for a Python module incorporating innovative recursive strategies:

```python

    def __init__(self, environment, model, max_memory_size=1000, discount_factor=0.9):
        """

                if not done:

### Key Components:
1. **Memory Buffer**: Uses a deque to store experiences for learning from past actions and decisions.
  
2. **Recursive Autonomy**: Implements a recursive strategy that allows the agent to improve iteratively. The depth of recursion controls how much self-improvement is attempted.

3. **Exploration and Learning**: Encourages exploration by introducing a probabilistic noise-based exploration mechanism. The learning model adapts by adjusting weights based on past experiences.

4. **Model Evolution**: The module facilitates evolving models over time through recursive autonomous behavior, ensuring the agents improve incrementally and adapt to changes in the environment.

5. **Traceable Performance**: Keeps track of the agentâ€™s performance with rewards history, aiding in the analysis of improvement over time.

This module represents a robust foundation for developing an autonomy stack capable of self-evolution and adaptability to novel scenarios. You can replace the placeholder methods and attributes like `model.predict` or `model.randomize_parameters` with concrete implementations fitting your architecture.
