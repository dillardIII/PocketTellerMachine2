To design a new Python module that expands the PTM (Presumably Pre-Trained Model) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack, we need to focus on creating a system that can learn and adapt itself over time. This involves leveraging recursive strategies to ensure continuous self-improvement and adaptation. Below is a conceptual outline for such a module, which I've named "AutoEclectica." This module incorporates recursive strategies, neural architecture search, reinforcement learning, and a feedback loop for iterative improvement. Note that actual implementation requires a more extensive setup, testing, and fine-tuning based on specific needs.

### Module: AutoEclectica

#### Key Features
1. **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**:
   - Automatically discovers the optimal neural network architecture for given tasks.
   - Utilizes reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms to evolve network designs.

2. **Self-Directed Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Implements recursive learning tasks where the agent sets new challenges based on past performance.
   - Automatically adjusts its learning goals and strategies.

3. **Meta-Learning**:
   - Learns how to learn by adjusting hyperparameters and optimization strategies dynamically.
   - Uses past experiences to facilitate faster learning on new tasks.

4. **Continuous Feedback Loop**:
   - Collects performance data to inform recursive learning processes.
   - Implements a feedback loop from deployment back to training to ensure improvements based on real-world usage.

5. **Evolutionary Algorithm Integration**:
   - Incorporates evolutionary strategies to mutate and recombine existing neural pathways to explore new potential solutions.

6. **Energy Efficiency Consideration**:
   - Includes mechanisms to evaluate and improve the energy efficiency of the autonomy stack.

#### Initial Setup

```python
# Import required libraries
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, Flatten
from evolutionary_algorithms import GeneticAlgorithm
from reinforcement_learning import ReinforcementAgent
from meta_learning import MetaLearner

class AutoEclectica:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_model = None
        self.history = []

    def initialize_model(self, input_shape, output_shape):
        self.current_model = Sequential([
            Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
            Flatten(),
            Dense(output_shape, activation='softmax')
        ])
        self.current_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    def recursive_search(self):
        # Implement neural architecture search
        ga = GeneticAlgorithm(population_size=50, mutation_rate=0.1, crossover_rate=0.5)
        best_architecture = ga.run(self.evaluate_model)
        self.current_model = best_architecture

    def evaluate_model(self, model):
        # Evaluate the model with current data
        return model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)

    def self_directed_learning(self):
        # Implement reinforcement learning to self-set tasks
        agent = ReinforcementAgent(self.current_model)
        agent.train(environment)

    def meta_learning_update(self):
        # Implement meta-learning to improve learning strategies
        meta_learner = MetaLearner(self.current_model)
        meta_learner.optimize_hyperparameters()

    def feedback_loop(self):
        # Gather feedback from real-world deployments and integrate it
        deployment_data = gather_deployment_data()
        self.history.append(deployment_data)
        self.current_model.fit(deployment_data['x'], deployment_data['y'])

    def run_evolution(self):
        # Execute evolutionary strategies to refine models
        self.current_model = mutate_and_recombine(self.current_model)

    def ensure_efficiency(self):
        # Improve energy efficiency of models
        optimize_energy_usage(self.current_model)

    def evolve(self):
        # Main loop for recursive strategies
        self.recursive_search()
        self.self_directed_learning()
        self.meta_learning_update()
        self.feedback_loop()
        self.run_evolution()
        self.ensure_efficiency()

# Example Usage
auto_eclectica = AutoEclectica()
auto_eclectica.initialize_model(input_shape=(28, 28, 1), output_shape=10)  # Assuming a dataset like MNIST
auto_eclectica.evolve()
```

### Notes
- **Scalability**: The module should be able to scale to larger datasets and more complex environments.
- **Adaptability**: Continuous monitoring and adjustment facilitate adaptability in rapidly changing environments.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance monitoring will be essential to ensure that the system is improving over time.
- **Ethical AI**: Ensure that the autonomy stack includes measures for ethical AI practices, such as mitigating biases.

This module is a starting point that combines multiple advanced AI strategies to foster autonomous learning and adaptation. It requires further customization and integration with specific datasets and environments to become fully operational in a real-world setting.
