Creating a new Python module to enhance the self-evolving autonomy stack for the PTM (Presumably a robotic or AI empire) involves integrating cutting-edge recursive strategies. Below, I outline a design with some high-level ideas and possible implementation details. This module will focus on continuous learning, autonomous decision-making, and self-improvement strategies.

### Key Concepts

1. **Recursive Learning**: Implement a recursive learning mechanism that uses feedback loops to improve decision-making algorithms continuously.
2. **Self-Diagnosis and Repair**: Allow the system to identify inefficiencies or errors and implement strategies to repair or improve itself.
3. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Integrate strategies for multiple autonomous agents to collaborate and make collective decisions.
4. **Cognitive Architecture**: Use layered architecture to separate decision-making, learning, and execution.
5. **Ethical Framework**: Ensure decisions comply with predefined ethical guidelines.

### Module Breakdown

1. **Recursive Learning**

   Develop algorithms that allow recursive refinement of models based on environmental feedback.

   ```python
   # recursive_learning.py

   class RecursiveLearner:
       def __init__(self, model):
           self.model = model

       def update_model(self, feedback):
           # Analyze feedback and adjust the model
           updated_model = self.model
           return updated_model

       def evaluate_performance(self):
           # Implement model evaluation logic
           performance_score = 0.0
           return performance_score
   ```

2. **Self-Diagnosis and Repair**

   Create methods for the system to identify its weaknesses and iterate improvements autonomously.

   ```python
   # self_diagnosis.py

   class SelfDiagnosis:
       def diagnose(self):
           # Logic for diagnosis
           issues = []
           return issues

       def repair(self, issues):
           # Logic for repairing identified issues
           resolved_issues = []
           return resolved_issues
   ```

3. **Multi-Agent Coordination**

   Design a protocol for agents to share information and plan jointly.

   ```python
   # multi_agent_coordination.py

   class AgentCoordinator:
       def __init__(self, agents):
           self.agents = agents

       def coordinate(self):
           # Logic for coordinating between agents
           collective_strategy = {}
           return collective_strategy
   ```

4. **Cognitive Architecture**

   Define a functional architecture separating concern areas such as perception, learning, and execution.

   ```python
   # cognitive_architecture.py

   class CognitiveLayer:
       def perceive(self, input_data):
           # Perception logic
           return perception

       def decide(self, perceived_data):
           # Decision-making logic
           return decision

       def execute(self, decision):
           # Execution logic
           pass
   ```

5. **Ethical Framework**

   Ensure that all activities comply with ethical standards defined by the PTM empire.

   ```python
   # ethics.py

   class EthicalFramework:
       def evaluate(self, decision):
           # Check decision against ethical standards
           is_ethical = True
           return is_ethical
   ```

6. **Utility Functions**

   Common utilities and helper functions.

   ```python
   # utils.py

   def log_activity(activity):
       # Logging logic
       pass

   def monitor_system():
       # System monitoring logic
       pass
   ```

### Integration

Integrate these components within the main autonomy framework, ensuring seamless interaction:

```python
# Integrate various components
from ptm_autonomy import (RecursiveLearner, SelfDiagnosis, 
                          AgentCoordinator, CognitiveLayer, EthicalFramework)

def main_autonomy_loop():
    learner = RecursiveLearner(model)
    diagnosis = SelfDiagnosis()
    coordinator = AgentCoordinator(agents)
    cognitive_layer = CognitiveLayer()
    ethics = EthicalFramework()

    while True:
        perception = cognitive_layer.perceive(environment_data)
        decision = cognitive_layer.decide(perception)
        
        if ethics.evaluate(decision):
            cognitive_layer.execute(decision)
            learner.update_model(feedback)

        issues = diagnosis.diagnose()
        if issues:
            diagnosis.repair(issues)
        
        coordinator.coordinate()

main_autonomy_loop()
```

This framework fosters self-improvement by continuously evaluating and integrating feedback, promoting effective multi-agent collaboration, and adhering to ethical guidelines, ultimately leading to a more robust PTM autonomy stack.
