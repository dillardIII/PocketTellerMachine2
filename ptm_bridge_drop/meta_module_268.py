Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably, PTM stands for a complex system within an autonomous or machine-learning context) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack requires a thoughtful approach that leverages innovative recursive strategies. Below is a high-level blueprint for creating such a module, which I’ll call `RecursiveAutonomy`.

### Module Overview

The `RecursiveAutonomy` module is designed to enhance the self-evolving capabilities of autonomous systems by implementing recursive strategies and algorithms. It focuses on continuous learning, adaptation, and complex decision-making through recursive pattern recognition and self-referencing methodologies.

### Key Features

1. **Recursive Learning Algorithm**: Implement algorithms that can adaptively learn from new data, recursively refining models over successive iterations.
   
2. **Self-Referencing Mechanism**: Enable the model to analyze its own output in relation to input to iteratively improve decisions and performance.
   
3. **Feedback Loop System**: Create a dynamic feedback loop system for real-time data processing and adaptation.
   
4. **Recursive Pattern Recognition**: Incorporate methods to identify and learn from recursive patterns in data for improved prediction and decision-making.

5. **Modular Integrations**: A design that supports integration with existing systems in the PTM stack to ensure interoperability and enhance previous models.

### Module Design

```python
# Filename: recursive_autonomy.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

class RecursiveAutonomy(BaseEstimator):
    def __init__(self, model, max_iterations=100, tolerance=0.001):
        self.model = model
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations
        self.tolerance = tolerance
        self.scaler = StandardScaler()

    def fit(self, X, y):
        X_scaled = self.scaler.fit_transform(X)
        previous_loss = np.inf
        for iteration in range(self.max_iterations):
            self.model.fit(X_scaled, y)
            predictions = self.model.predict(X_scaled)
            loss = np.mean((predictions - y) ** 2)

            if abs(previous_loss - loss) < self.tolerance:
                print(f"Convergence reached at iteration {iteration}")
                break
            previous_loss = loss

    def predict(self, X):
        X_scaled = self.scaler.transform(X)
        return self.model.predict(X_scaled)

    def recursive_self_analysis(self, X):
        # Implement self-referencing logic: Model's output analysis for enhancement.
        predictions = self.predict(X)
        # Example: Adjust based on mean prediction drift
        drift = np.mean(predictions)
        self.model.intercept_ -= drift / 2

    def feedback_loop(self, data_stream):
        for data in data_stream:
            X, y = data
            self.fit(X, y)
            self.recursive_self_analysis(X)
            yield self.predict(X)

# Usage Example:
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create an instance of RecursiveAutonomy with a simple model
autonomy_model = RecursiveAutonomy(model=LinearRegression())
```

### Recursive Strategies

1. **Iterative Model Updating**: Each call to `fit` refines the model based on the latest data, aiming for convergence with a tolerance level.

2. **Cross-Iteration Self-Analysis**: The method `recursive_self_analysis` allows the model to introspect and adjust based on the average prediction drift from its estimations.

3. **Dynamic Feedback Iterations**: The method `feedback_loop` continuously updates the model as new data becomes available, which supports real-time adaptive learning, perfectly suited for evolving environments.

### Further Enhancements

- **Metaheuristics**: Integrate genetic algorithms or simulated annealing for optimizing recursive strategies.
  
- **Dynamic Tuning**: Add modules for automatic hyperparameter tuning based on recursive model performance.
  
- **Advanced Pattern Recognition**: Implement neural network integrations like LSTMs for sophisticated sequence prediction.

This `RecursiveAutonomy` module provides a robust framework to extend the PTM empire's self-evolving capabilities by leveraging recursive strategies for ongoing learning and adaptation.
