Creating a new Python module to enhance the autonomy stack for the PTM (Presumably "Powerful Technological Mechanisms" or similar hypothetical entity) empire involves designing complex systems that utilize recursive strategies to allow self-evolution. This approach may include features such as self-optimization, adaptability, and predictive modeling.

Below is an outline of the Python module named `ptm_autonomy` focusing on these aspects:

### Key Components:

1. **Self-Optimization Engine**:
   - Uses machine learning to fine-tune parameters.
   - Implements evolutionary algorithms for natural selection of models.
   
2. **Adaptive Learning Modules**:
   - Incorporates reinforcement learning to adapt to new data.
   - Context-aware learning, adjusting to environmental changes.
   
3. **Predictive Modeling System**:
   - Utilizes recursive neural networks (RNNs) for time-series predictions.
   - Leverages ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy.

4. **Recursive Strategy Executor**:
   - Implements a recursive function execution tracker.
   - Provides rollback and retry mechanisms for recursive processes.
   
5. **Integration Interface**:
   - API to communicate with other modules and systems.
   - Event-driven architecture for seamless integration.

### Key Innovative Recursive Strategies:

- **Recursive Optimization**: 
  Use recursive functions to iteratively refine hyperparameters in machine learning models for optimal performance.
  
- **Nested Learning**:
  Implement nested loops of learning where models continuously learn from both new data inputs and results of their previous predictions or actions.
  
- **Hierarchical Task Execution**:
  Use recursive task management to decompose complex tasks into sub-tasks, ensuring efficient resource allocation and parallel processing.

Here's a basic skeleton of how the module might be structured in Python:

```python
# ptm_autonomy.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
import logging

class SelfOptimizationEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.best_params = {}
    
    def optimize(self, data, target):
        # Implement evolutionary algorithm for optimizing parameters
        pass
        
    def recursive_optimization(self, models, data, target, depth=0, max_depth=5):
        if depth >= max_depth:
            return

        # Example: Recursive tuning of model parameters
        for model in models:
            # Recursively optimize model
            print(f"Optimizing {model} at depth {depth}")
            self.optimize(data, target)
            self.recursive_optimization([model], data, target, depth + 1, max_depth)
        
        return self.best_params


class AdaptiveLearningModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = []
    
    def add_model(self, model):
        self.models.append(model)
    
    def adapt(self, new_data, feedback):
        # Implement reinforcement learning
        pass


class PredictiveModelingSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = self.build_model()

    def build_model(self):
        model = Sequential()
        model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(100, 1)))
        model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=False))
        model.add(Dense(1))
        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
        return model
        
    def predict(self, data):
        # Recursive prediction method
        pass


class RecursiveStrategyExecutor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger('RecursiveStrategyExecutor')
    
    def execute(self, task, *args, **kwargs):
        try:
            task(*args, **kwargs)
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Error executing task {task.__name__}: {e}")
            # Implement rollback or retry if necessary
            pass


class IntegrationInterface:
    def __init__(self):
        # Set up API and event-driven architecture
        pass
    
    def send_event(self, event):
        # Implement event sending
        pass
    
    def receive_event(self):
        # Implement event reception
        pass


# Example Usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    data, target = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]), np.array([1, 0])
    optimizer = SelfOptimizationEngine()
    optimizer.recursive_optimization([RandomForestClassifier()], data, target)

    predictive_system = PredictiveModelingSystem()
    predictive_system.predict(data)
```

### Goals of the Module:

- **Autonomous Parameter Tuning**: Automatically refine algorithms and systems to achieve optimal performance based on recursive feedback loops.

- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Allow the system to adjust its behavior and strategies based on real-time input and historical data.

- **Predictive Accuracy**: Enhance the capability to forecast future states and actions, improving preemptive decision-making.

- **Robust Integration**: Ensure seamless communication between various components, reacting in near real-time to ecosystem changes.

This module, once fully developed, would substantially increase the autonomous capabilities of the PTM empire's stack, effectively allowing it to self-evolve, adapt, and efficiently manage tasks in a dynamically changing environment.
