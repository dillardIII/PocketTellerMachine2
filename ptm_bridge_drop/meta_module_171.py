Creating a Python module to support the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves leveraging advanced algorithms, machine learning models, and recursive strategies designed to empower autonomous systems to grow and adapt over time. Below is a conceptual design for such a module. This design will focus on a few key strategies: evolutionary algorithms, self-learning mechanisms, and recursive strategy integration.

### Module Overview

The module, named `ptm_evolve`, will include the following components:

1. **Evolutionary Algorithm Engine:** Uses genetic algorithms to optimize and evolve various strategies autonomously.

2. **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** A self-learning agent that can learn from the environment and improve its performance over time.

3. **Recursive Strategy Manager:** Manages recursive strategy implementation to continually enhance decision-making capabilities.

4. **Simulation Environment:** A testing environment that simulates different scenarios for training and evolving the autonomy stack.

### Module Components

#### 1. Evolutionary Algorithm Engine

The evolutionary algorithm engine is responsible for generating a pool of strategies, evaluating them, and selecting the best-performing ones to evolve the autonomy stack.

```python
import random

class EvolutionaryAlgorithm:
    def __init__(self, population_size, mutation_rate):
        self.population_size = population_size
        self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate
        self.population = self.initialize_population()
    
    def initialize_population(self):
        return [self.random_strategy() for _ in range(self.population_size)]
    
    def random_strategy(self):
        # Randomly generate new strategies
        return {'parameter1': random.random(), 'parameter2': random.random()}
    
    def evaluate(self, strategy):
        # Implement evaluation of a strategy
        return sum(strategy.values())  # Placeholder for actual evaluation logic
    
    def mutate(self, strategy):
        # Implement mutation logic to slightly alter the strategy
        strategy['parameter1'] += random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)
        strategy['parameter2'] += random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)
        return strategy
    
    def evolve(self):
        # Evaluate the current population
        scored_population = [(self.evaluate(strategy), strategy) for strategy in self.population]
        scored_population.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Select the top strategies
        survivors = [strategy for _, strategy in scored_population[:self.population_size // 2]]
        
        # Mutate and generate new population
        self.population = survivors + [self.mutate(random.choice(survivors)) for _ in range(self.population_size // 2)]
```

#### 2. Reinforcement Learning Agent

The reinforcement learning agent learns through interactions with the environment and rewards received from its actions.

```python
import numpy as np

class ReinforcementLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_space, action_space):
        self.state_space = state_space
        self.action_space = action_space
        self.q_table = np.zeros((state_space, action_space))
        self.learning_rate = 0.1
        self.discount_factor = 0.9
        self.epsilon = 0.1
    
    def choose_action(self, state):
        if np.random.rand() < self.epsilon:
            return np.random.choice(self.action_space)  # Explore
        else:
            return np.argmax(self.q_table[state])  # Exploit
    
    def update(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        best_next_action = np.argmax(self.q_table[next_state])
        td_target = reward + self.discount_factor * self.q_table[next_state, best_next_action]
        self.q_table[state, action] += self.learning_rate * (td_target - self.q_table[state, action])
```

#### 3. Recursive Strategy Manager

This component enables the recursive integration of new strategies into the existing system, allowing for dynamic adaptation and optimization.

```python
class RecursiveStrategyManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategies = []
    
    def add_strategy(self, strategy):
        self.strategies.append(strategy)
    
    def execute_recursive(self):
        for strategy in self.strategies:
            # Execute strategy and possibly evolve recursively
            improved = self.recursive_improvement(strategy)
            if improved:
                self.strategies.append(improved)
    
    def recursive_improvement(self, strategy):
        # Placeholder for recursive strategy enhancement logic
        modified_strategy = self.evolve_strategy(strategy)
        if self.evaluate_strategy(modified_strategy) > self.evaluate_strategy(strategy):
            return modified_strategy
        return None
    
    def evolve_strategy(self, strategy):
        # Logic to evolve strategy, for instance via slight modifications
        return strategy
    
    def evaluate_strategy(self, strategy):
        # Evaluate the strategy
        return 100  # Placeholder score
```

#### 4. Simulation Environment

A simulated environment allows for the training and testing of various strategies.

```python
class SimulationEnvironment:
    def run_simulation(self, strategy):
        # Simulate the environment with the given strategy
        return random.uniform(0, 1)  # Return a reward or score
```

### Integration

The `ptm_evolve` module integrates all these components into a cohesive system that continually evolves and optimizes the autonomy stack, enhancing the adaptability and self-sufficiency of the PTM empire's technological assets.

This design allows for seamless integration of new strategies, continuous learning from real-time interactions, and recursive optimization to ensure long-term autonomy.
