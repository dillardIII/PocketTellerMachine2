Creating a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional empire for this context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack would involve designing a system that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to autonomously adapt and improve over time. To incorporate innovative recursive strategies, the module should include provisions for recursive learning, evolution, and strategy adaptation.

Below is a high-level design outline for such a module, named `AutonomyStack`, complete with example code.

### 1. Architecture Overview

- **Recursive Learning Engine**: Continuously learns and adapts using feedback loops.
- **Evolutionary Strategy Module**: Implements evolutionary algorithms for self-improvement.
- **Decision-Making Layer**: Uses AI for tactical decisions based on learned data.
- **Dynamic Knowledge Base**: Stores and retrieves knowledge, learning from history.
- **Monitoring and Feedback System**: Monitors operation and feeds back into learning processes.

### 2. Key Components

#### a. Recursive Learning Engine

This component continuously trains models with new data and self-generated feedback.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import joblib

class RecursiveLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self, model=None):
        self.model = model or RandomForestClassifier()
   
    def fit(self, X, y):
        # Initial training
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        print(f"Initial model accuracy: {self.model.score(X_test, y_test)}")
        
    def recursive_learn(self, new_data, new_labels):
        # Recursive learning with new feedback data
        self.model.fit(new_data, new_labels, warm_start=True)
        # Save model state
        joblib.dump(self.model, 'self_evolving_model.pkl')

```

#### b. Evolutionary Strategy Module

Applies concepts from genetic algorithms to improve strategies based on past performance.

```python
import random

class EvolutionaryStrategyModule:
    def __init__(self, population_size, mutation_rate):
        self.population_size = population_size
        self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate
        self.population = self._initialize_population()
    
    def _initialize_population(self):
        # Initialize random strategies
        return [{'strategy': np.random.rand(), 'fitness': 0} for _ in range(self.population_size)]
    
    def evaluate(self, fitness_function):
        # Assess fitness of each strategy
        for individual in self.population:
            individual['fitness'] = fitness_function(individual['strategy'])
    
    def evolve(self):
        # Select, crossover, and mutate strategies
        sorted_pop = sorted(self.population, key=lambda ind: ind['fitness'], reverse=True)
        next_gen = sorted_pop[:self.population_size//2]
        
        while len(next_gen) < self.population_size:
            parent1, parent2 = random.sample(next_gen, 2)
            child_strategy = self._crossover(parent1['strategy'], parent2['strategy'])
            child_strategy = self._mutate(child_strategy)
            next_gen.append({'strategy': child_strategy, 'fitness': 0})
        
        self.population = next_gen
    
    def _crossover(self, parent1, parent2):
        return (parent1 + parent2) / 2  # Simple average
    
    def _mutate(self, strategy):
        if random.random() < self.mutation_rate:
            return strategy + np.random.normal(0, 0.01)  # Small mutation
        return strategy
```

#### c. Decision-Making Layer

Utilizes AI to make decisions based on evolving strategies and learned data.

```python
class DecisionMakingLayer:
    def __init__(self, learning_engine, strategy_module):
        self.learning_engine = learning_engine
        self.strategy_module = strategy_module

    def decide(self, input_data):
        best_strategy = max(self.strategy_module.population, key=lambda ind: ind['fitness'])
        features = self.extract_features(input_data, best_strategy)
        decision = self.learning_engine.model.predict([features])
        return decision

    def extract_features(self, input_data, strategy):
        # Extract features influenced by the best strategy
        return input_data * strategy['strategy']
```

### 3. Dynamic Knowledge Base

A simplified version may just rely on a structured file-based system or an advanced database system depending on complexity.

### 4. Monitoring and Feedback System

Ensures continuous feedback loops by monitoring system performance and feeding results back into learning algorithms.

### Usage Example:

```python
# Instantiate components
learning_engine = RecursiveLearningEngine()
strategy_module = EvolutionaryStrategyModule(population_size=10, mutation_rate=0.1)
decision_maker = DecisionMakingLayer(learning_engine, strategy_module)

# Train and evolve strategies
X, y = np.random.randn(100, 10), np.random.randint(2, size=100)  # Example dataset
learning_engine.fit(X, y)
strategy_module.evaluate(lambda strategy: np.random.random())  # Fitness for demonstration
strategy_module.evolve()

# Make a decision
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 10)
decision = decision_maker.decide(input_data)
print("Decision:", decision)
```

### Conclusion

This module represents a self-adaptive system capable of evolving over time with recursive learning and strategic adjustments. The recursive strategies focus on both improving the learning models and optimizing the decision-making strategies through evolutionary algorithms. This setup offers a foundation for any empire, fictional or real, striving to achieve autonomous and self-optimizing systems.
