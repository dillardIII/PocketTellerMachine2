Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Potentially Transformative Modules) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves a combination of advanced machine learning techniques, recursive strategies, and adaptive algorithms. Below is a conceptual design for such a module.

### Module Name: `AutonomyEvolver`

#### Key Features

1. **Self-Optimizing Agents**: Agents that learn and adapt based on past performance using recursive strategies.

2. **Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Employ RNNs for pattern recognition in time-series data to enhance predictive capabilities.

3. **Meta-Learning**: Implement meta-learning algorithms to allow the model to learn how to learn, improving its adaptability.

4. **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use recursive search strategies for automated hyperparameter optimization.

5. **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Framework**: Integrate RL to enable agents to learn optimal strategies through trial and error.

#### Core Components

1. **Recursive Agent Architecture (RAA)**:
    - Implements self-evolving agents using recursive strategies.
    - Each agent has a feedback loop to continually adapt based on environmental inputs.

2. **Advanced Neural Network Models**:
    - RNNs and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for handling sequential data.
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance spatial pattern recognition.

3. **Meta-Learning Techniques**:
    - Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for generalization across tasks.
    - Recursive updates that optimize model parameters at multiple layers of abstraction.

4. **Automated Hyperparameter Optimization**:
    - Recursive grid and random search methods.
    - Bayesian optimization for efficient search space exploration.

5. **Reinforcement Learning Layer**:
    - Actors and critics are in a continuous loop of improvement.
    - Use of recursive Q-learning and policy gradient methods.

6. **Data Augmentation and Simulation**:
    - Simulate varying scenarios to train agents in diverse environments.
    - Recursive data augmentation to enhance dataset robustness.

#### Example Structure

```python
# AutonomyEvolver Module

class RecursiveAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = None

    def update(self, feedback):
        """Recursively update based on feedback."""
        # Call recursive optimization functions
        pass

    def act(self, environment):
        """Perform action based on environment state."""
        # Apply RNN for decision-making
        pass


class MetaLearner:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def optimize(self, agent):
        """Perform meta-learning optimization."""
        # Implement MAML or similar techniques
        pass


def recursive_hyperparameter_optimization(model):
    """Recursive method for hyperparameter tuning."""
    # Implement Bayesian or grid search strategies
    pass


def reinforcement_learning_loop(agent, environment):
    """Continuous learning through interaction."""
    # Use Q-learning or policy gradient methods
    pass


# Example usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Initialize modules and environments
    agent = RecursiveAgent()
    learner = MetaLearner()
    environment = None  # Replace with actual environment

    # Simulate recursive learning
    while True:
        current_state = environment.get_state()
        action = agent.act(current_state)
        feedback = environment.provide_feedback(action)
        agent.update(feedback)

        recursive_hyperparameter_optimization(agent)
        learner.optimize(agent)

        if environment.is_goal_state():
            break
```

### Conclusion

This design introduces a modular approach combining various aspects of AI and ML to enhance autonomy in the PTM empire. By leveraging recursive strategies, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning, the `AutonomyEvolver` module offers a robust framework for developing self-evolving, adaptive systems. This framework should be iteratively improved through real-world testing and continuous integration of state-of-the-art techniques.
