Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably an Autonomous System) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack is an intriguing task. Let us consider developing a framework that supports recursive learning and decision-making strategies, fostering an environment of continuous improvement and adaptation.

### Module Overview

This module, called `AutonomyStack`, will focus on recursive learning, adaptability, and decision-making. We will implement several components: simulation environments, a recursive learning framework, and optimization strategies. Here’s a high-level design:

### Key Components

1. **Environment Simulation**: 
   - This submodule creates diverse simulation environments for testing and training autonomous agents.
   
2. **Recursive Learning Framework**: 
   - Leverages multi-level learning strategies where the system refines its decision-making processes through recursive self-assessment and adaptation.

3. **Optimization Strategies**:
   - Implements cutting-edge algorithms to optimize decision processes.

4. **Evaluation and Metrics**:
   - Provides automated metrics and evaluation systems to assess performance continually.

### Detailed Design

#### 1. Environment Simulation
```python
# environment.py

from typing import Any

class Environment:
    def __init__(self, config: dict):
        self.config = config

    def simulate(self) -> Any:
        # Execute the simulation given the configuration
        return self.config["scenario"]

    def reset(self) -> None:
        # Reset the environment to its initial state
        pass
```

#### 2. Recursive Learning Framework
```python
# recursive_learning.py

class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, initial_policy: Any):
        self.policy = initial_policy

    def assess_and_adapt(self, observations: Any) -> None:
        self.evaluate(observations)
        self.adapt_policy()

    def evaluate(self, observations: Any) -> dict:
        # Perform evaluation of the current policy
        performance = {}  # Mock performance metrics
        return performance

    def adapt_policy(self):
        # Adapt the policy based on evaluations
        self.policy = self.policy  # Simple placeholder for policy adaptation
```

#### 3. Optimization Strategies
```python
# optimization.py

import numpy as np

class Optimizer:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate: float):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate

    def optimize(self, data: np.ndarray) -> None:
        # Perform optimization using a method such as gradient descent
        pass
```

#### 4. Evaluation and Metrics
```python
# evaluation.py

class Evaluator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []

    def record_metrics(self, metrics: dict) -> None:
        self.history.append(metrics)

    def report(self) -> dict:
        # Generate a report based on recorded metrics
        return {"average_performance": sum(m["score"] for m in self.history) / len(self.history)}
```

### Integration Example

Here is how these components could work together in a simplified integration script:

```python
from environment import Environment
from recursive_learning import RecursiveLearner
from optimization import Optimizer
from evaluation import Evaluator

# Initialize components
env = Environment(config={"scenario": "default"})
learner = RecursiveLearner(initial_policy="basic_policy")
optimizer = Optimizer(learning_rate=0.01)
evaluator = Evaluator()

# Simulation loop
for epoch in range(10):
    state = env.simulate()
    learner.assess_and_adapt(state)
    optimizer.optimize(np.array([state]))
    current_metrics = learner.evaluate(state)
    evaluator.record_metrics(current_metrics)

# Reporting
final_report = evaluator.report()
print("Final Report:", final_report)
```

This design provides the foundation for an autonomous stack with self-improving capabilities. The use of recursion in the learning framework ensures continuous evolution via recursive assessment and adjustment, embodying the idea of self-evolving autonomy.

### Next Steps

- **Enhance Adaptive Algorithms**: Incorporating advanced machine learning technologies like reinforcement learning could enhance the adaptive nature of the policies.
- **Robust Simulation Scenarios**: Develop more complex and diverse environments.
- **Advanced Performance Metrics**: Implement detailed analytics for better insights.
- **Scalability**: Optimize components to handle larger datasets and complexities. 

This overarching structure allows the PTM empire to create a dynamically improving, autonomous system capable of adapting to new challenges and environments through self-reflection and recursive adjustments.
