Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a technology enterprise) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating cutting-edge technologies, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and incorporating recursive learning strategies. Here's an abstract proposal for such a module, focusing on autonomous systems using recursive machine learning and distributed architecture. The design will be high-level, emphasizing flexibility and future adaptability.

### Module Overview

**Module Name:** `PTMAutonomy`

**Objective:** To enhance the capabilities of autonomous systems through self-learning and adaptation, by leveraging recursive strategies, distributed processing, and continuous integration of learning feedback loops.

#### Core Components

1. **Recursive Learning Engine (RLE):**
   - Implements algorithmic strategies for continuous feedback integration and model refinement.
   - Uses techniques like reinforcement learning with recursive approaches (e.g., Q-Learning with dynamic exploration).
   - Employs meta-learning to adapt learning processes based on past experiences.

2. **Distributed Decision Making System (DDMS):**
   - Facilitates real-time data sharing and decision-making across the network of autonomous agents.
   - Employ strategies like Consensus Algorithms (e.g., Paxos, Raft) for synchronized, decentralized decisions.
   - Incorporate federated learning to enhance decision-making while preserving data privacy.

3. **Adaptive Scenario Simulation (ASS):**
   - Enables the simulation of various real-world scenarios for training and testing models.
   - Incorporates environmental dynamics and stochastic processes to validate model robustness.
   - Offers plug-in support for various domain-specific scenario generators.

4. **Autonomous Feedback Loop (AFL):**
   - Collects real-time feedback from deployed models and adapts them based on performance data.
   - Uses anomaly detection to identify areas needing improvement or change.
   - Utilizes a shadow mode deployment feature for safe real-world scenario testing.

5. **Integration and Deployment Interface (IDI):**
   - Simplifies the integration of the autonomy stack with existing PTM infrastructure.
   - Provides APIs for seamless deployment, monitoring, and scaling of autonomous systems.
   - Offers tools for version control, rollback mechanisms, and system health checks.

### Example Implementation

Here's a simplified illustration of how you might begin implementing such a module in Python.

```python
# PTMAutonomy Module Base Structure

class RecursiveLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        self.experience_buffer = []

    def train(self, data):
        # Recursive reinforcement learning logic
        for state, action, reward in data:
            self.update_policy(state, action, reward)
        
    def update_policy(self, state, action, reward):
        # Update the model's policy based on feedback.
        pass

class DistributedDecisionMakingSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = []

    def sync_decisions(self):
        # Implement consensus algorithm for decision making.
        pass

class AdaptiveScenarioSimulation:
    def __init__(self, scenario_config):
        self.scenario = scenario_config

    def run_simulation(self):
        # Run scenario and return results for analysis.
        pass

class AutonomousFeedbackLoop:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_data = []

    def collect_and_analyze(self, new_data):
        # Analyze performance and identify improvement areas.
        pass

class IntegrationDeploymentInterface:
    def __init__(self):
        self.api_endpoint = "/deploy"

    def deploy_model(self, model):
        # Deploy model to the PTM infrastructure.
        pass

# Higher-level orchestration
class PTMAutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self, model, scenario_config):
        self.rle = RecursiveLearningEngine(model)
        self.ddms = DistributedDecisionMakingSystem()
        self.ass = AdaptiveScenarioSimulation(scenario_config)
        self.afl = AutonomousFeedbackLoop()
        self.idi = IntegrationDeploymentInterface()

    def train_and_deploy(self, training_data):
        self.rle.train(training_data)
        self.ddms.sync_decisions()
        self.afl.collect_and_analyze(training_data)
        self.idi.deploy_model(self.rle.model)

```

### Key Innovations

- **Recursive Learning:** The use of recursive strategies allows the system to iteratively improve its performance over time, effectively building a robust model capable of adapting to changes in the environment.
- **Distributed Architecture:** Ensures that systems remain scalable and robust, handling large scales of data while maintaining quick adaptation and decision-making.
- **Continuous Integration:** By constantly collecting and integrating feedback, the module ensures the system evolves efficiently in dynamic environments.

### Conclusion

This Python module design aims to provide a foundation for extending the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack, integrating innovation in recursive learning and distributed architecture. Future work could involve more in-depth exploration into specific algorithms, more specialized simulators, or detailed deployment strategies in operational environments.
