Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional entity) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves several steps. Here's a conceptual approach for building such a module:

### Module Overview

The module will be called `PTMRecursiveAutonomy`. Its purpose is to enhance autonomy using recursive strategies that allow the stack to self-evolve and adapt to new problems over time. This involves recursive learning, self-optimization, and adaptability to changing conditions or objectives.

### Key Features

1. **Recursive Learning Strategy**: Implements recursive functions that learn from previous outputs to make future decisions more efficient and accurate.

2. **Self-Optimization**: Integrates methods for self-analysis where various components of the system optimize themselves based on performance metrics.

3. **Adaptability and Flexibility**: Provides adaptability to continuously change and improve its strategies based on the dynamic environment.

4. **Modularity**: Easy integration with existing systems and other modules within the PTM empire's stack.

5. **Monitoring and Feedback Loops**: Introduces feedback loops for constant monitoring and fine-tuning.

6. **Scalability**: Ensues the module can scale with increasing complexity.

### Proposed Structure

```python
# ptm_recursive_autonomy.py

import numpy as np

class PTMRecursiveAutonomy:
    def __init__(self, initial_state, evaluation_metric):
        self.state = initial_state
        self.evaluation_metric = evaluation_metric
        self.history = []

    def recursive_strategy(self, input_data):
        # Stub for recursive strategy implementation
        # Base Case
        if self.convergence_criterion_met():
            return self.state
        # Recursive Case
        self.history.append(self.state)
        new_state = self.self_optimization(input_data)
        return self.recursive_strategy(new_state)

    def convergence_criterion_met(self):
        # Determine if the recursive function has reached a stable state
        # For example, based on a threshold of improvement or evaluation metric
        if len(self.history) < 2:
            return False
        return abs(self.evaluation_metric(self.history[-1]) - 
                   self.evaluation_metric(self.history[-2])) < 0.01

    def self_optimization(self, input_data):
        # Optimize the current state based on the input_data
        # You could use Gradient Descent or other optimization algorithms
        return input_data * np.random.rand()  # Simulated optimization

    def adapt_to_change(self, new_conditions):
        # Logic to adapt to new conditions/environment
        self.state *= new_conditions

    def monitor_and_feedback(self):
        # Feedback loop to adjust strategies based on performance
        performance = self.evaluation_metric(self.state)
        print("Current performance metric:", performance)
        return performance

    def run(self, input_data, new_conditions):
        self.adapt_to_change(new_conditions)
        return self.recursive_strategy(input_data)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    def evaluation_metric(x):
        # Dummy evaluation metric; in practice, implement your real metric
        return np.sum(x)

    initial_state = np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0])
    ptm_system = PTMRecursiveAutonomy(initial_state, evaluation_metric)
    
    input_data = np.array([2.0, 2.0, 2.0])
    new_conditions = np.array([0.9, 1.1, 1.0])
    
    final_state = ptm_system.run(input_data, new_conditions)
    print("Final State:", final_state)
```

### Concepts Explained

- **Recursive Strategy**: The core idea of recursion here is used to allow the system to repeatedly refine its state until a convergence criterion is met.

- **Convergence Criteria**: A condition that ensures the recursion doesn't run indefinitely and stops once improvements are minimal.

- **Self-Optimization**: A placeholder for more complex logic where the system learns and updates itself using sophisticated algorithms (e.g., machine learning models).

- **Adaptability**: A separate function handles changes in the environment or conditions, allowing the system to remain robust and versatile.

- **Monitoring**: By logging and responding to performance metrics, the module can dynamically adjust its strategies to improve over time.

This design is just a starting point, and in a practical application, deeper domain specificity, more complex strategies, and integration with existing systems would be required.
