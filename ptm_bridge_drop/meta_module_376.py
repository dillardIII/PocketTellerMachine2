Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional empire) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack can be an intriguing challenge. We will focus on implementing innovative recursive strategies which can enable self-evolution, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities. This complexity can be managed through recursive self-enhancement, data-driven decision loops, and using machine learning paradigms.

### Overview of the Proposed Module

The module, named `ptm_autonomy_stack`, will focus on these core components:
- **Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI)**: Allow the system to enhance its own codebase and algorithms.
- **Adaptive Learning Algorithms**: Utilize machine learning and reinforcement learning for adaptability.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Include components for collecting and analyzing environment data.
- **Predictive Modelling**: Use predictive models to forecast potential outcomes and adjust strategies accordingly.

### Key Implementation Details

Here's a high-level design of the module with Python code snippets leveraging these strategies:

```python
# ptm_autonomy_stack module
import copy
import random
import json
import pickle
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = DecisionTreeRegressor()
        self.data = []

    def gather_data(self, environment_data):
        """Simulate gathering data from the environment."""
        self.data.append(environment_data)

    def recursive_self_improvement(self):
        """Improve algorithm based on recursive strategy."""
        print("Improving autonomy stack through recursive strategies.")
        # Dummy recursive model improvement: removing bias from previous iterations
        self.model = DecisionTreeRegressor()
           
    def adaptive_learning(self):
        """Implement an adaptive learning mechanism."""
        if self.data:
            X = [d['features'] for d in self.data]
            y = [d['outcome'] for d in self.data]
            X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
            self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
            y_pred = self.model.predict(X_test)
            print(f"Model evaluation: MSE = {mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)}")

    def collect_feedback(self, feedback):
        """Recursively process feedback to improve autonomy."""
        print(f"Collected feedback: {feedback}")
        self.recursive_self_improvement()
        
    def predict_outcome(self, features):
        """Predict the outcome of a decision."""
        prediction = self.model.predict([features])
        print(f"Predicted outcome: {prediction}")
        return prediction

    def save_state(self, filename='autonomy_state.pkl'):
        """Save the current state of the autonomy stack."""
        with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
            pickle.dump(self, f)
        print("State saved successfully.")

    def load_state(filename='autonomy_state.pkl'):
        """Load a saved state of the autonomy stack."""
        with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
            return pickle.load(f)

    def make_decision(self, environment):
        """Make a decision based on current knowledge."""
        print("Making decision based on current knowledge.")
        features = self.analyze_environment(environment)
        return self.predict_outcome(features)

    def analyze_environment(self, environment):
        """Simulate environment analysis."""
        return [random.uniform(0, 1) for _ in range(10)]

# Example of module usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    autonomy_system = AutonomyStack()
    # Simulating environment data collection and decision making
    for _ in range(5):
        env_data = {'features': [random.uniform(0, 1) for _ in range(10)], 'outcome': random.uniform(0, 1)}
        autonomy_system.gather_data(env_data)
    autonomy_system.adaptive_learning()
    decision = autonomy_system.make_decision(environment={})
    autonomy_system.save_state()
    loaded_system = AutonomyStack.load_state()
```

### Key Features and Strategies

1. **Recursive Self-Improvement**: The system can reload and update its model, improving prediction accuracy based on feedback loops.
2. **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilization of regression models for prediction and decision-making ensures adaptability.
3. **Environment Interaction**: Simulated through data gathering and feature analysis, it facilitates learning from dynamic conditions.
4. **State Persistence**: The ability to save and load existing states allows the system to retain knowledge over iterations.

### Further Improvements

- Implement more advanced machine learning models such as neural networks.
- Enhance feedback mechanisms with state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques.
- Integrate a continuous deployment pipeline for truly self-evolving code updates.
- Incorporate more complex environment simulations to test adaptive capabilities extensively.

This module lays out the foundational framework for developing a self-evolving autonomy stack, combining recursive strategy with machine learning for proactive intervention and adaptation.
