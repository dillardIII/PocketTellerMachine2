Designing a Python module for the PTM (Presumably "Parametric Technology Management" or another similar entity, depending on your context) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack involves introducing innovative recursive strategies that enhance learning, adaptability, and decision-making processes. Here’s a high-level design of such a module:

```python
# ptm_autonomy.py

import numpy as np
import random
from typing import List, Callable, Any

class AutonomyUnit:
    def __init__(self, state_dim: int, action_dim: int):
        # State and action dimensions define the environment characteristics.
        self.state_dim = state_dim
        self.action_dim = action_dim
        # Initializing weights randomly for the purpose of evolution.
        self.weights = np.random.rand(state_dim, action_dim)
    
    def act(self, state: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        # Compute action based on a simple weighted sum and softmax transformation
        z = np.dot(state, self.weights)
        exp_scores = np.exp(z - np.max(z))  # numerical stability
        return exp_scores / exp_scores.sum(axis=0)

    def mutate(self, rate: float = 0.1):
        # Mutates the weights by adding a small random value to each weight
        mutation = np.random.randn(*self.weights.shape) * rate
        self.weights += mutation
    
    def clone(self) -> 'AutonomyUnit':
        # Deep copy of the autonomy unit
        clone = AutonomyUnit(self.state_dim, self.action_dim)
        clone.weights = np.copy(self.weights)
        return clone

class EvolutionarySolver:
    def __init__(self, unit_count: int, state_dim: int, action_dim: int):
        self.units = [AutonomyUnit(state_dim, action_dim) for _ in range(unit_count)]
        self.state_dim = state_dim
        self.action_dim = action_dim

    def evolve(self, fitness_function: Callable[[AutonomyUnit], float]):
        # Evaluate fitness of each unit
        fitness_scores = [fitness_function(unit) for unit in self.units]
        # Select units to survive using a probability proportional to fitness
        survivors = self.select_survivors(fitness_scores)
        # Clone and mutate
        self.units = [self.units[i].clone() for i in survivors]
        for unit in self.units:
            unit.mutate()

    def select_survivors(self, fitness_scores: List[float]) -> List[int]:
        total_fitness = sum(fitness_scores)
        probabilities = [score / total_fitness for score in fitness_scores]
        return random.choices(range(len(self.units)), weights=probabilities, k=len(self.units))

def recursive_strategy(state: np.ndarray, module: AutonomyUnit, depth: int) -> np.ndarray:
    # A recursive action strategy, which uses predictions from child actions to adjust parent actions
    if depth <= 0:
        return module.act(state)
    
    sub_action = module.act(state)
    future_state = predict_future_state(state, sub_action)
    future_action = recursive_strategy(future_state, module, depth - 1)
    
    # Recursively integrates current and anticipated future actions for refinement
    return integrate_actions(sub_action, future_action)

def predict_future_state(current_state: np.ndarray, action: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Placeholder for state transition model; requires implementation
    return current_state + action

def integrate_actions(current_action: np.ndarray, future_action: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Combines actions recursively, giving weight to future actions
    weight_current, weight_future = 0.5, 0.5  # Could be adaptive
    return (weight_current * current_action) + (weight_future * future_action)

# Example of a fitness function
def simple_fitness_function(unit: AutonomyUnit) -> float:
    # Placeholder: a dummy function that just rewards smaller weights
    return -np.sum(np.abs(unit.weights))

# Usage
state_dim = 5
action_dim = 3
unit_count = 10

solver = EvolutionarySolver(unit_count, state_dim, action_dim)
for _ in range(100):  # Evolving over 100 generations
    solver.evolve(simple_fitness_function)

selected_unit = solver.units[0]
example_state = np.random.rand(state_dim)
action = recursive_strategy(example_state, selected_unit, 3)
```

### Key Features:

1. **Autonomy Unit**: Represents autonomous agents with mutable weights, capable of action selection and self-modification through mutation.

2. **Evolutionary Solver**: Manages a population of `AutonomyUnit` instances, evolving them based on a specified fitness function. Surviving units are chosen based on fitness proportional selection, mimicking natural selection.

3. **Recursive Strategy**: Implements recursive decision-making. It refines actions by considering potential future states recursively, providing a strategic layer for anticipatory adjustments.

4. **Fitness Function**: Provides an example of a customizable fitness evaluation, which must be specified to ensure units evolve towards desirable traits related to task-specific adaptations.

This module can be further expanded with more complex environment interactions, advanced mutation strategies, and diversified fitness functions to refine the self-evolving autonomy stack.
