Designing a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably, you're referring to a company or project name; I'll use "PTM" for consistency) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that not only adapts and learns from its environment but also evolves over time through recursive strategies. Below is a high-level design, along with some pseudo-code and explanations to achieve such a goal.

### Key Components

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**:
    - Continuously gather data from various sources.
    - Preprocess and clean the data to ensure it is suitable for model consumption.

2. **Machine Learning & Recursive Strategies**:
    - Implement self-improvement using meta-learning strategies.
    - Utilize recursive neural networks (RNNs) and evolutionary algorithms.

3. **Dynamic Model Generation**:
    - Automatically generate new models based on the data.
    - Use model validation techniques to ensure reliability.

4. **Self-Optimization & Reinforcement**:
    - Implement reinforcement learning components that allow the system to improve upon itself autonomously.
    - Include feedback loops for continuous performance evaluation and adjustment.

5. **Autonomous Deployment & Management**:
    - Enable modules or agents to be dynamically deployed in various environments and scales.
    - Implement monitoring tools for system health and performance.

### Python Module Design

Below is a conceptual design and implementation in Python:

```python
# Module: ptm_autonomy

import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
from evolutionary_search import EvolutionaryAlgorithmSearchCV

class DataCollector:
    def __init__(self, source):
        self.source = source
    
    def collect_data(self):
        # Implement logic to connect to data source and retrieve data
        pass
    
    def preprocess_data(self, raw_data):
        # Example preprocessing steps
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        return scaler.fit_transform(raw_data)

class RecursiveStrategy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(50, 50), max_iter=1000)
    
    def train(self, X, y):
        self.model.fit(X, y)
        
    def predict(self, X):
        return self.model.predict(X)
    
    def evolve(self, X, y):
        param_grid = {"hidden_layer_sizes": [(50,), (50, 50), (100,)],
                      "activation": ["tanh", "relu"],
                      "solver": ["sgd", "adam"]}
        
        search = EvolutionaryAlgorithmSearchCV(
            estimator=MLPRegressor(max_iter=1000),
            params=param_grid,
            cv=3,
            verbose=1
        )
        
        search.fit(X, y)
        self.model = search.best_estimator_

class SelfOptimizingAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_collector = DataCollector(source='data_source')
        self.strategy = RecursiveStrategy()
    
    def run(self):
        data = self.data_collector.collect_data()
        processed_data = self.data_collector.preprocess_data(data)
        
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
            processed_data['features'], processed_data['target'], test_size=0.2)
        
        # Train model
        self.strategy.train(X_train, y_train)
        
        # Evaluate and evolve the model
        initial_performance = self.strategy.predict(X_test)
        self.strategy.evolve(X_train, y_train)
        evolved_performance = self.strategy.predict(X_test)
        
        # Implement logic to assess and compare initial and evolved performance
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = SelfOptimizingAgent()
    agent.run()
```

### Features and Explanation

- **DataCollector**: Responsible for interfacing with the data source and preprocessing inputs to ensure they are suitable for the learning models.
- **RecursiveStrategy**: Contains a basic implementation of a recursive learning strategy using a neural network. The `evolve` method uses an evolutionary algorithm to optimize model parameters.
- **SelfOptimizingAgent**: Acts as the orchestrator, pulling the components together to autonomously adapt and improve over time.

### Innovative Aspects

- **Meta-Learning**: Utilizes evolving strategies to not just train on data but to learn how to improve model architectures autonomously.
- **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Provides a mechanism for exploring the hyperparameter space dynamically.
- **Feedback Loop**: Continuous monitoring and self-assessment ensure the stack evolves towards higher efficiency and performance.

This architecture aims for maximum flexibility and adaptation by leveraging recursive strategies, allowing the system to autonomously evolve better solutions over time.
