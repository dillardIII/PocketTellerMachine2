Designing a Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical or proprietary entity, as no specific context is available) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies can be approached from a modular software engineering perspective. This entails incorporating machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, and recursive function designs to facilitate adaptability and self-improvement over time.

Let's outline a high-level design for this module:

### Module: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Overview

The `ptm_autonomy` module is designed to provide self-evolving capabilities for complex systems, leveraging recursive strategies and adaptive algorithms. The module incorporates a variety of machine learning models, optimization techniques, and recursive functions to enable self-improvement through continuous learning and adaptation.

#### Key Components

1. **Environment Interface**:
   - Standard interface to interact with different environments, collect data, and execute actions.
   
2. **Recursive Learning Engine**:
   - Implements recursive function calls to refine strategies and decision-making processes. This engine can repeatedly apply solutions to problems by breaking them down into simpler, self-similar problems.
   
3. **Evolutionary Strategy Processor**:
   - Utilizes genetic algorithms or other evolutionary computing techniques to iteratively improve models or strategies over time.
   
4. **Self-assessment Evaluator**:
   - Continuously evaluates the performance and effectiveness of current strategies and models and suggests improvements.
   
5. **Adaptive Model Framework**:
   - Incorporates machine learning models capable of adapting based on environmental feedback and historical performance data.
   
6. **Data Feedback Loop**:
   - Ensures perturbations in the system feedback loop trigger adaptations in both learning models and strategies.

#### Implementation Details

```python
# File: ptm_autonomy.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from deap import base, creator, tools, algorithms

class EnvironmentInterface:
    def __init__(self, environment):
        self.environment = environment
    
    def interact(self, strategy):
        state = self.environment.get_state()
        action = strategy(state)
        reward, new_state = self.environment.execute_action(action)
        return state, action, reward, new_state

class RecursiveLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.results = {}
    
    def recursive_optimize(self, problem, depth=3):
        if problem.is_simple() or depth == 0:
            solution = self.basic_solve(problem)
            return solution

        subproblems = problem.decompose()
        solutions = [self.recursive_optimize(subproblem, depth - 1) for subproblem in subproblems]
        aggregated_solution = problem.aggregate(solutions)
        self.results[problem] = aggregated_solution
        return aggregated_solution

class EvolutionaryStrategyProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        creator.create("FitnessMax", base.Fitness, weights=(1.0,))
        creator.create("Individual", list, fitness=creator.FitnessMax)

    def evolve(self, population):
        toolbox = base.Toolbox()
        toolbox.register("evaluate", self.evaluate_function)
        toolbox.register("mate", tools.cxTwoPoint)
        toolbox.register("mutate", tools.mutGaussian, mu=0, sigma=1, indpb=0.1)
        toolbox.register("select", tools.selTournament, tournsize=3)

        population = toolbox.map(self.create_individual, range(population))
        algorithms.eaSimple(population, toolbox, cxpb=0.5, mutpb=0.2, ngen=10, verbose=True)

    def evaluate_function(self, individual):
        # Dummy function; should integrate with actual strategy scoring.
        return (sum(individual),)

class AdaptiveModelFramework:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = RandomForestRegressor()
    
    def train(self, X, y):
        self.model.fit(X, y)

    def predict(self, X):
        return self.model.predict(X)

# Entry point function to initiate the self-evolving stack
def main():
    environment = EnvironmentInterface(SomeEnvironment())
    learning_engine = RecursiveLearningEngine()
    strategy_processor = EvolutionaryStrategyProcessor()
    model_framework = AdaptiveModelFramework()

    # Example of using the components
    initial_population = 100
    strategy_processor.evolve(initial_population)

    for _ in range(100):  # Run for 100 iterations
        state, action, reward, new_state = environment.interact(model_framework.predict)
        # Train and adapt model based on feedback
        model_framework.train([state], [reward])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Considerations

- **Modularity**: Components should be highly modular with clear interfaces, allowing easy extension or substitution of components.
- **Scalability**: Ensure module operations remain efficient as problem size increases.
- **Maintainability**: Write clean, well-documented code to support updates and troubleshooting.
- **Security**: Ensure data pipelines are secure, especially in autonomous applications impacting critical systems.

This outline sets the foundation for an innovative approach to enhancing autonomy in complex systems, leveraging recursion and evolutionary strategies to self-evolve efficiently and flexibly.
