Designing a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably "Predictive Technology Management" or another context-specific name) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can dynamically adapt and improve its performance through recursive strategies. The goal is to develop a robust, flexible, and intelligent system that can manage and optimize its operations autonomously. Here's a high-level design of such a module:

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Key Components:

1. **Data Acquisition Layer**:
   - `DataCollector`: Interface for gathering data from various sources such as sensors, logs, APIs, etc.
   - `DataPreprocessor`: Module for cleaning, normalizing, and transforming raw data into usable formats.

2. **Learning and Adaptation Layer**:
   - `RecursiveSelfImprover`: Core component that uses recursive strategies to enhance system performance. It employs:
     - **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Utilizes RL agents to explore actions and optimize control strategies.
     - **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**: Implements GAs for evolving and selecting optimal strategies over generations.
     - **Bayesian Optimization**: Adopts probabilistic models to fine-tune hyperparameters and improve decision-making.
   
3. **Decision-Making and Planning Layer**:
   - `DecisionEngine`: Handles real-time decision-making using predictive models.
   - `DynamicPlanner`: Develops and adapts operational plans based on evolving scenarios and feedback.

4. **Execution Layer**:
   - `TaskManager`: Oversees execution of plans, allocation of resources, and task distribution.
   - `FeedbackLoop`: Continuously monitors outcomes and performance metrics, feeding back into the system to facilitate learning and adaptation.

5. **Introspection and Analysis Layer**:
   - `Introspector`: Facilitates self-analysis to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
   - `Analyzer`: Uses statistical analysis and anomaly detection to evaluate system performance.

#### Recursive Strategies:

- **Iterative Learning Cycles**: Implement recursive cycles where each iteration learns from past experiences to enhance future performance. This includes continuous evaluation and integration of new data and insights.
  
- **Multi-layered Feedback Loops**: Deploy nested feedback loops to process information at different abstraction levels, ensuring robustness in learning and adaptability in dynamic environments.

- **Self-Optimization Algorithms**: Develop algorithms that can iteratively refine their own processes, identifying and applying improvements autonomously.

#### Code Structure (High-Level):

```python
# ptm_autonomy/__init__.py

from .data_acquisition import DataCollector, DataPreprocessor
from .learning_adaptation import RecursiveSelfImprover
from .decision_making_planning import DecisionEngine, DynamicPlanner
from .execution import TaskManager, FeedbackLoop
from .introspection_analysis import Introspector, Analyzer
```

```python
# ptm_autonomy/data_acquisition.py

class DataCollector:
    def collect(self):
        # Implementation for collecting data
    
class DataPreprocessor:
    def preprocess(self, data):
        # Implementation for data preprocessing
```

```python
# ptm_autonomy/learning_adaptation.py

import reinforcement_learning as rl
import genetic_algorithms as ga
import bayesian_optimization as bo

class RecursiveSelfImprover:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rl_model = rl.Agent()
        self.ga_model = ga.GeneticAlgorithm()
        self.bo_model = bo.BayesianOptimizer()
    
    def improve(self):
        # Recursive improvement strategy
```

```python
# ptm_autonomy/decision_making_planning.py

class DecisionEngine:
    def make_decision(self, data):
        # Decision-making logic
    
class DynamicPlanner:
    def plan(self, decision):
        # Planning logic
```

```python
# ptm_autonomy/execution.py

class TaskManager:
    def execute(self, plan):
        # Task execution logic

class FeedbackLoop:
    def update(self, outcome):
        # Feedback loop logic
```

```python
# ptm_autonomy/introspection_analysis.py

class Introspector:
    def introspect(self):
        # Introspection logic
    
class Analyzer:
    def analyze(self, data):
        # Performance analysis logic
```

### Conclusion

This Python module design provides a comprehensive framework for enhancing an autonomy stack with recursive self-improving capabilities. The integration of innovative recursive strategies ensures continuous learning, adaptation, and optimization, allowing the PTM empire to efficiently manage complex operations and remain resilient in face of changing environments and challenges.
