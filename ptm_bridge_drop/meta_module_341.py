Creating a Python module to expand the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves designing a system that can learn, adapt, and optimize itself over time. Below is a conceptual outline and sample code to demonstrate how such a module might be structured using recursive strategies and advanced learning techniques:

### Conceptual Outline

1. **Recursive Learning Algorithms**: Implement algorithms that allow the system to refine its strategies through recursive functions, potentially using techniques like reinforcement learning, genetic algorithms, or neural networks.

2. **Self-Optimization**: Incorporate methods for continuous self-assessment and optimization based on environmental feedback and internal performance metrics.

3. **Modular Architecture**: Design the module to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy integration with existing systems and future enhancements.

4. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Utilize large datasets and real-time data streams to inform decision-making processes.

5. **Autonomy & Adaptability**: Ensure the system can operate autonomously, adapting to new environments and challenges without human intervention.

### Sample Code

Below is a basic implementation of a recursive self-learning module using Python. This example incorporates a simple recursive function to simulate a learning process, utilizing reinforcement learning principles.

```python
import random

class SelfEvolvingAI:
    def __init__(self, environment):
        self.environment = environment
        self.knowledge_base = {}
        self.learning_rate = 0.1
        self.discount_factor = 0.9

    def perceive_environment(self):
        return self.environment.get_state()

    def choose_action(self, state):
        if state not in self.knowledge_base:
            self.knowledge_base[state] = [random.random() for _ in range(self.environment.action_space_size)]
        
        return max(range(self.environment.action_space_size), key=lambda a: self.knowledge_base[state][a])

    def learn(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        best_next_action = self.choose_action(next_state)
        updated_value = ((1 - self.learning_rate) * self.knowledge_base[state][action] +
                         self.learning_rate * (reward + self.discount_factor * self.knowledge_base[next_state][best_next_action]))
        self.knowledge_base[state][action] = updated_value

    def recursive_strategy(self, state, depth=0):
        if depth > 10:  # Base case for recursion
            return

        action = self.choose_action(state)
        reward, next_state = self.environment.execute_action(action)

        self.learn(state, action, reward, next_state)

        # Recursive call to further explore the environment
        self.recursive_strategy(next_state, depth + 1)

    def run(self, episodes):
        for _ in range(episodes):
            state = self.perceive_environment()
            self.recursive_strategy(state)

# Mock Environment Example
class MockEnvironment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.action_space_size = 5

    def get_state(self):
        return random.randint(0, 10)

    def execute_action(self, action):
        next_state = random.randint(0, 10)
        reward = random.choice([-1, 0, 1])  # Simple reward structure
        return reward, next_state

# Example usage
environment = MockEnvironment()
autonomous_system = SelfEvolvingAI(environment)
autonomous_system.run(episodes=1000)

```

### Key Features and Innovations

- **Recursive Strategies**: The `recursive_strategy` method enables deep exploration of possibilities by making recursive calls, allowing the AI to explore various depth levels and help discover complex strategies autonomously.

- **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: The AI is designed to improve its performance over time by learning from the feedback it receives from the environment.

- **Modularity & Extensibility**: The module is built to be modular, allowing for easy updates and integration with other systems within the autonomy stack.

- **Adaptive Learning Rate & Parameters**: Consider implementing adaptive mechanisms where learning parameters can evolve based on historical performance metrics.

This design is a starting point, and further advancements such as integration with real-world data, multi-agent systems, and more sophisticated AI models like deep neural networks could be considered for a robust implementation.
