Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably, "Predictive Technology Models", though the specificity may vary based on your context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack is an ambitious task. This involves developing recursive strategies that enable the system to learn and adapt independently over time. Here’s a conceptual outline and an example implementation approach that you might consider. This focuses on modularity, scalability, and recursive self-improvement.

### Concepts

1. **Recursive Learning**: Implement recursive strategies for self-evaluation and model improvement. This involves defining a feedback loop where models continually assess and refine themselves based on performance metrics.

2. **Modularity**: Different components of the autonomy stack (e.g., perception, decision-making, and control) should be modular to allow isolated improvements and testing.

3. **Scalability**: Design the module to scale with data and computation resources without significant architecture changes.

4. **Distributed Systems**: Consider distributed systems for parallel processing and overcoming hardware limitations.

5. **Self-Diagnostics**: Implement diagnostics to identify potential faults or suboptimal performance in real-time.

### Module Design

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import threading
import logging

# Initialize logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Define a recursive learning class
class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, model, data, target):
        self.model = model
        self.data = data
        self.target = target
        self.history = []
        
    def train_model(self):
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(self.data, self.target, test_size=0.2)
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions = self.model.predict(X_test)
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
        logging.info(f"Model trained with accuracy: {accuracy}")
        return accuracy

    def recursive_improvement(self, max_iterations=10, tolerance=0.01):
        iteration = 0
        improvement = True
        while improvement and iteration < max_iterations:
            accuracy = self.train_model()
            self.history.append(accuracy)
            
            if len(self.history) < 2:
                iteration += 1
                continue
            
            # Check if improvement is significant
            improvement = (accuracy - self.history[-2]) > tolerance
            iteration += 1
            logging.info(f"Iteration {iteration}, Improvement: {improvement}")

        logging.info("Recursive learning process completed.")
        return self.model

# Example usage with random data
def main():
    # Create synthetic data for demonstration
    X, y = np.random.rand(100, 10), np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
    
    # Initialize a classifier
    rf_model = RandomForestClassifier()
    
    # Initialize RecursiveLearner
    learner = RecursiveLearner(rf_model, X, y)
    
    # Improve the model recursively
    improved_model = learner.recursive_improvement()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Innovation and Features

1. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Implement adaptive thresholds for improvements based on metrics beyond accuracy, like precision and recall, or domain-specific KPIs.

2. **Smart Feature Engineering**: Incorporate automated feature selection and engineering, using techniques such as genetic algorithms or deep reinforcement learning.

3. **Real-Time Processing**: If applicable, integrate real-time data pipelines using tools like Kafka or Apache Flink to handle streaming data.

4. **Parallel Processing**: Utilize Python's `multiprocessing` or concurrent execution with async frameworks to handle model evaluations in parallel.

5. **Self-Diagnosis Logs**: Enhance the logging mechanism to provide self-diagnosis logs that can proactively alert on potential degradations in performance.

6. **Explainability**: Integrate explainability tools (such as SHAP or LIME) to assess which features are influencing model decisions, aiding in trust and transparency.

This conceptual framework is just a starting point. The actual implementation will depend on the specific needs and infrastructure of the PTM empire’s existing stack.
