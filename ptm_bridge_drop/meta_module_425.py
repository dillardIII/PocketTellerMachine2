Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a theoretical or fictional empire's) self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves creating a high-level architecture that focuses on self-improvement, adaptability, and minimal human intervention. Below is an outline and example code to illustrate some concepts that could be incorporated into such a module.

### Module Overview

This module will focus on three primary functions:
1. **Recursive Learning:** Implementing strategies for self-improvement using recursive algorithms to iterate and refine models.
2. **Autonomous Decision-Making:** Enhancing decision-making capabilities using self-evolving logic.
3. **Adaptable Architecture:** Designing a flexible framework that can adapt to new inputs and experiences, continuously self-calibrating over time.

### Key Concepts

- **Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs):** Useful for processing data in a hierarchical manner.
- **Genetic Algorithms (GA):** Can be implemented to evolve solutions over time.
- **AutoML (Automated Machine Learning):** Enabling the system to automatically select and adjust models.

### Example Code

Here is a simplified Python module that leverages these concepts.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from deap import base, creator, tools, algorithms

class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self, max_iterations=50):
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations
        self.model = None

    def recursive_training(self, X, y):
        # Split the data
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)
        
        best_model = None
        best_accuracy = 0
        
        for iteration in range(self.max_iterations):
            # Train MLP classifier as a base model
            model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(10, 10))
            model.fit(X_train, y_train)
            accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test))
            
            print(f"Iteration {iteration}, Accuracy: {accuracy}")
            
            if accuracy > best_accuracy:
                best_model = model
                best_accuracy = accuracy
            
            # Recursively improve by increasing neurons if accuracy stagnates
            if iteration > 0 and iteration % 5 == 0:
                model.set_params(hidden_layer_sizes=(10 + iteration, 10 + iteration))
        
        self.model = best_model

    def evolve(self, X, y):
        # Evolutionary strategy using DEAP
        def eval_function(individual):
            # Map the individual to parameters, e.g., hidden layers
            model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(individual[0], individual[1]))
            model.fit(X_train, y_train)
            predictions = model.predict(X_test)
            return accuracy_score(y_test, predictions),

        # Define the Genetic Algorithm
        creator.create("FitnessMax", base.Fitness, weights=(1.0,))
        creator.create("Individual", list, fitness=creator.FitnessMax)
        
        toolbox = base.Toolbox()
        toolbox.register("attr_int", np.random.randint, 5, 50)
        toolbox.register("individual", tools.initRepeat, creator.Individual, 
                         toolbox.attr_int, n=2)
        toolbox.register("population", tools.initRepeat, list, toolbox.individual)
        
        toolbox.register("evaluate", eval_function)
        toolbox.register("mate", tools.cxTwoPoint)
        toolbox.register("mutate", tools.mutFlipBit, indpb=0.05)
        toolbox.register("select", tools.selTournament, tournsize=3)
        
        # Execute the Genetic Algorithm
        population = toolbox.population(n=10)
        algorithms.eaSimple(population, toolbox, cxpb=0.5, mutpb=0.2, ngen=10, verbose=True)
        
        self.model = population[0]  # Store best model found

# Sample Usage
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

stack = AutonomyStack()
stack.recursive_training(X, y)
stack.evolve(X, y)
```

### Explanation of Key Components:

1. **Recursive Training:** Uses an iterative approach to optimize a simple MLP model's architecture based on performance, incrementally increasing complexity if necessary.
2. **Genetic Algorithm (GA):** Utilizes DEAP to evolve the network's structure by treating architectural components as chromosomes, finding optimal solutions over successive generations.
3. **Self-Improvement Mechanism:** Periodically checks for performance stagnation and adapts the model's configuration accordingly to avoid local optima.

With this kind of module, the PTM empire's autonomy stack can evolve to adapt to changing requirements and environments, continuously refining its capabilities with minimal human guidance.
