### PTM Empire's Self-Evolving Autonomy Stack: The `AutonomyEngine` Module

The new Python module, `AutonomyEngine`, is designed to leverage cutting-edge recursive strategies for building and expanding the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack. It introduces several key components and strategies that allow for dynamic decision-making and adaptability in complex environments.

#### Key Features

1. **Recursive Learning Algorithms**: Implement advanced recursive learning strategies that improve over iterations and adapt to new data patterns.

2. **Autonomous Decision-Making**: A decision-making system that evaluates multiple strategies and chooses optimal paths in an autonomous manner.

3. **Dynamic Environment Interaction**: Interacts with its environment through modular sensor integration, allowing the system to perceive changes and adjust its behavior accordingly.

4. **Self-Optimization**: Features an optimizer that fine-tunes parameters recursively to meet evolving business goals and operational constraints.

5. **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to scale seamlessly with the expansion of the PTM empire, accommodating increasing data volumes and complexity.

    def run(self):
        # Main loop for the autonomy stack
        while True:
            current_state = self.sensor.get_state()
            decision = self.decision_maker.make_decision(current_state)

### Explanation

- **NeuralRecursiveStrategy**: This component handles the recursive learning of neural networks or other models, refining them iteratively based on new data and previous outcomes.

- **DecisionMaker**: Based on various strategies, this subsystem autonomously selects the optimal decision at any given moment, based on the current environment state.

- **EnvironmentSensor**: Provides real-time updates on the system's surroundings, allowing the autonomy stack to be aware of its environment.

- **SelfOptimizer**: Continuously tunes system parameters using recursive algorithms to enhance performance and achieve key objectives.

- **AutonomyEngine**: Integrates all components, orchestrating the system's operation by making decisions, executing strategies, and adapting to new environmental data.

### Implementation Strategy

- Build and test each component individually to ensure robust performance.
- Integrate the components, ensuring seamless communication and interaction between the parts.
- Use simulated environments for testing initial iterations, progressing to real-world conditions as confidence in the system grows.
- Continuously gather feedback and refine algorithms to improve accuracy and efficiency over time.
