Designing a Python module to expand PTM (Presumably a context-specific empire in a hypothetical situation) with a focus on self-evolving autonomy and recursive strategies involves several steps. Here's a conceptual overview and some code snippets to guide you:

### Overview

1. **Self-Evolving System**: The system should be capable of self-improvement by learning from its experiences and adapting its strategies.
2. **Recursive Strategies**: Implement strategies that utilize recursive algorithms to solve complex problems or make decisions based on branching possibilities.
3. **Modularity**: The system should be modular to allow different components to evolve independently.

### Conceptual Design

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on performance metrics and environmental conditions.
2. **Learning Module**: Implement machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and improve strategies.
3. **Decision Making Module**: Use recursive decision-making algorithms for strategic planning and actions.
4. **Feedback Mechanism**: A continuous feedback loop to evaluate the performance of current strategies.
5. **Simulation Environment**: Sandbox environment to test and evolve strategies without affecting the real-world system until they are validated.

### Python Module Design

```python
import random
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

class SelfEvolvingAutonomy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier()
        self.performance_data = []

    def collect_data(self, current_state, action, result):
        # Collect data as tuples of (state, action, result)
        self.performance_data.append((current_state, action, result))

    def train_model(self):
        # Simple example of training a RandomForest model on collected data
        X, y = self.prepare_data(self.performance_data)
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions = self.model.predict(X_test)
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
        print(f"Model trained with accuracy: {accuracy}")

    def prepare_data(self, data):
        # Prepare data for training by extracting features and labels
        features = [d[0] + [d[1]] for d in data]  # current_state + action
        labels = [d[2] for d in data]  # result
        return np.array(features), np.array(labels)

    def recursive_strategy(self, current_state, depth=0):
        # Recursive strategy example
        if depth > 5:  # Base case to prevent infinite recursion
            return self.evaluate_state(current_state)
        
        # Explore actions and choose the best one recursively
        possible_actions = self.get_possible_actions(current_state)
        best_action = None
        best_value = float('-inf')
        
        for action in possible_actions:
            new_state = self.simulate_action(current_state, action)
            value = self.recursive_strategy(new_state, depth + 1)
            if value > best_value:
                best_value = value
                best_action = action

        return best_action

    def get_possible_actions(self, state):
        # Define how to get possible actions from the current state
        return [random.choice(['action1', 'action2', 'action3'])]

    def simulate_action(self, state, action):
        # Define a simulation of the action on the state
        # This function should return a new state after the action is applied
        return state + [action]

    def evaluate_state(self, state):
        # Evaluate the given state to produce a score
        return random.random()

# Example usage
autonomy_system = SelfEvolvingAutonomy()

# Simulate data collection
for _ in range(100):
    state = [random.random() for _ in range(3)]  # Example state
    action = random.choice(['action1', 'action2'])
    result = random.choice([0, 1])  # Example result based on action
    autonomy_system.collect_data(state, action, result)

# Train the model with collected data
autonomy_system.train_model()

# Recursive decision making
initial_state = [random.random() for _ in range(3)]
best_action = autonomy_system.recursive_strategy(initial_state)
print(f"The best action determined is: {best_action}")
```

### Innovative Strategies

- **Hierarchical Recursive Strategies**: Implement strategies that split problems into sub-problems, solving them recursively and combining results for an overall solution.
- **Dynamic Learning Rate**: Adjust learning algorithms' rates based on feedback from past performance metrics to expedite evolution or avoid overfitting.
- **Collaborative Learning**: If applicable, allow multiple agents to share insights and strategies to jointly evolve and adapt to changes.

This modular and recursive approach empowers your PTM empire's autonomy stack to learn, adapt, and optimize strategies recursively, ensuring continuous improvement in performance and decision-making capabilities.
