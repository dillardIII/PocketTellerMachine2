Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (which I'll assume stands for "Post-Turing Machine" or a similar concept) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves designing a framework with advanced recursive strategies enabling it to adapt, learn, and optimize over time. To achieve this, we'll integrate concepts such as genetic algorithms, neural networks, self-modifying code, and recursive improvement strategies. Below is a high-level design outline with code snippets to illustrate the core ideas.

### Module Design: `ptm_self_evo`

#### Key Components

1. **Genetic Algorithm Layer**: For evolving solutions over generations.
2. **Neural Network Layer**: To provide learning capabilities from evolving datasets.
3. **Recursive Improvement Engine**: To iteratively improve and refactor models.
4. **Self-Modifying Code**: Allows the system to change its own algorithms over time.
5. **Performance Monitoring and Feedback**: Continuously monitors system performance and provides feedback for improvement.

#### Implementation Outline

```python
# File: ptm_self_evo/__init__.py

class GeneticAlgorithm:
    def __init__(self, population_size, mutation_rate):
        # Initialize with a population and mutation settings
        self.population_size = population_size
        self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate
        self.population = self._initialize_population()

    def _initialize_population(self):
        # Create an initial population with random solutions
        return [self._random_solution() for _ in range(self.population_size)]

    def _random_solution(self):
        # Generate a random solution (e.g., weights of a neural network)
        pass

    def evolve(self, fitness_function):
        # Evolve the solution set
        for generation in range(100):  # Example: 100 generations
            self.population = sorted(self.population, key=fitness_function)
            self.population = self._reproduce(self.population)

    def _reproduce(self, sorted_population):
        # Apply crossover and mutation
        next_generation = []
        while len(next_generation) < self.population_size:
            parent1, parent2 = self._select_parents(sorted_population)
            offspring = self._crossover(parent1, parent2)
            next_generation.append(self._mutate(offspring))
        return next_generation

    def _select_parents(self, sorted_population):
        # Select two parents using a selection algorithm
        return sorted_population[0], sorted_population[1]  # Simplified

    def _crossover(self, parent1, parent2):
        # Combine two parents to produce an offspring
        pass

    def _mutate(self, offspring):
        # Introduce mutations
        pass

class NeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self, layers):
        # Define the architecture
        self.layers = layers
        self.build_model()

    def build_model(self):
        # Build and compile the neural network
        pass

    def train(self, data, labels):
        # Train the model
        pass

    def predict(self, inputs):
        # Make predictions
        pass

class RecursiveImprovement:
    def __init__(self, initial_model):
        self.model = initial_model

    def improve(self):
        # Iteratively improve the model
        for _ in range(10):  # Example: 10 improvement cycles
            self.model = self._refactor_model(self.model)

    def _refactor_model(self, model):
        # Analyze and refactor the model based on performance
        pass

class PerformanceMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []

    def log_performance(self, metrics):
        # Log performance data
        self.history.append(metrics)

    def provide_feedback(self):
        # Analyze performance data and suggest improvements
        pass

class SelfModifyingAlgorithm:
    def __init__(self, code_block):
        self.code_block = code_block

    def modify_code(self):
        # Self-modify the code to improve performance
        pass

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ga = GeneticAlgorithm(population_size=50, mutation_rate=0.1)
    nn = NeuralNetwork(layers=[10, 5, 1])
    improvement_engine = RecursiveImprovement(nn)
    monitor = PerformanceMonitor()

    # Evolve
    ga.evolve(fitness_function=lambda solution: -sum(solution))  # Dummy fitness function

    # Train
    nn.train(data=[], labels=[])

    # Improve
    improvement_engine.improve()

    # Monitor & Feedback
    monitor.log_performance({'accuracy': 0.95})
    monitor.provide_feedback()

    # Self-modify
    sma = SelfModifyingAlgorithm(code_block=lambda x: x**2)
    sma.modify_code()
```

#### Key Innovations

- **Recursive Improvement**: Constantly refactor and improve upon past solutions adapting recursively to new scenarios.
- **Self-Modifying Code**: Enable the system to rewrite its own code logic, allowing for new strategies to be integrated dynamically without external intervention.
- **Feedback Loop**: Systematically improves based on performance feedback, helping it to understand its own strengths and weaknesses.
  
This modular architecture can be expanded with more sophisticated techniques for each module, including deep learning models, advanced genetic programming methodologies, and additional recursive strategies to handle diverse tasks and dynamic conditions.
