Designing a Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical entity in this context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves implementing features that promote adaptability, self-learning, and recursive improvement. Here's a conceptual design and a possible implementation outline:

### Module Overview:

The module, `autonomy_stack`, is designed to enhance autonomy through self-learning and recursive strategies. Emphasis is placed on iterative learning, adaptive improvement, and decision-making.

#### Key Components:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Efficient data handling and preprocessing to ensure quality input for the learning algorithms.

2. **Recursive Learning Algorithms:** A set of algorithms that iteratively learn from the environment and from past experiences, using techniques like reinforcement learning.

3. **Adaptation and Feedback Loops:** Mechanisms to adaptively modify learning parameters based on real-time feedback.

4. **Self-evaluation and Meta-learning:** Systems to evaluate performance and adjust learning strategies autonomously.

5. **Scalability and Flexibility:** Ensuring the module is scalable to handle increased data or more complex tasks without significant redesign.

### Implementation Outline:

1. **autonomy_stack/__init__.py**

   Define necessary imports and initial configurations.

2. **autonomy_stack/data_handler.py**

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   class DataHandler:
       def __init__(self, data_source):
           self.data_source = data_source

       def acquire_data(self):
           # Mock acquisition, change to actual data source
           return pd.read_csv(self.data_source)

       def preprocess_data(self, df):
           # Example preprocessing steps, customize as needed
           df = df.dropna()
           df = df.astype(float)
           return df
   ```

3. **autonomy_stack/recursive_learning.py**

   ```python
   import numpy as np

   class RecursiveLearner:
       def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.1, discount_factor=0.9):
           self.learning_rate = learning_rate
           self.discount_factor = discount_factor
           self.q_table = {}

       def learn(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
           old_value = self.q_table.get((state, action), 0)
           next_max = max(self.q_table.get((next_state, a), 0) for a in range(action_space))

           new_value = (1 - self.learning_rate) * old_value + self.learning_rate * (reward + self.discount_factor * next_max)
           self.q_table[(state, action)] = new_value

       def choose_action(self, state, exploration_rate):
           if np.random.rand() < exploration_rate:
               return np.random.choice(action_space)  # Explore
           return max(range(action_space), key=lambda x: self.q_table.get((state, x), 0))  # Exploit
   ```

4. **autonomy_stack/adaptation.py**

   ```python
   class AdaptationSystem:
       def __init__(self, learner):
           self.learner = learner

       def adjust_parameters(self, performance_metrics):
           # Basic rule for adjusting parameters based on performance
           if performance_metrics['success_rate'] < 0.7:
               self.learner.learning_rate += 0.01
           else:
               self.learner.learning_rate -= 0.01

       def feedback_loop(self, real_time_data):
           # Process real-time data to adjust strategies
           metrics = self.evaluate(real_time_data)
           self.adjust_parameters(metrics)

       def evaluate(self, data):
           # Placeholder for a real evaluation process
           return {'success_rate': np.mean(data)}
   ```

5. **autonomy_stack/meta_learning.py**

   ```python
   class MetaLearner:
       def __init__(self, learners):
           self.learners = learners

       def evaluate_learners(self):
           performances = [self.evaluate(learner) for learner in self.learners]
           best_performance = max(performances)
           best_learner = self.learners[performances.index(best_performance)]
           return best_learner, best_performance

       def evaluate(self, learner):
           # Perform evaluation logic, placeholder example
           return np.random.rand()

       def evolve(self):
           best_learner, _ = self.evaluate_learners()
           for learner in self.learners:
               learner.learning_rate = best_learner.learning_rate  # Simple evolution strategy
   ```

6. **Example Usage**

   ```python
   from autonomy_stack.data_handler import DataHandler
   from autonomy_stack.recursive_learning import RecursiveLearner
   from autonomy_stack.adaptation import AdaptationSystem
   from autonomy_stack.meta_learning import MetaLearner

   data_handler = DataHandler(data_source='data.csv')
   data = data_handler.acquire_data()
   preprocessed_data = data_handler.preprocess_data(data)

   learner = RecursiveLearner()
   adaptation_system = AdaptationSystem(learner)
   meta_learner = MetaLearner([learner])
   
   # Simulate a learning process
   state, action, reward, next_state = (1, 0, 1, 2)
   learner.learn(state, action, reward, next_state)

   # Adjust learning based on feedback
   adaptation_system.feedback_loop(preprocessed_data)

   # Perform meta-learning
   meta_learner.evolve()
   ```

### Innovative Aspects:

- **Recursive Learning:** Continually refining the decision-making process by revisiting past states and decisions.
- **Adaptive Parameters:** Dynamically adjusting learning rates and strategies based on success rates.
- **Meta-learning Capability:** A structured way to evaluate and evolve learning algorithms based on performance, effectively creating an ecosystem of competing algorithms where the best strategies are adopted.
- **Feedback Integration:** Continuous loop between learning adaptation, data processing, and strategy alteration ensures agility in a changing environment.

This design and implementation framework sets a solid foundation for a highly adaptive and evolvable autonomy stack, capable of refining its strategies based on recursive learning with feedback loops and meta-evaluation.
