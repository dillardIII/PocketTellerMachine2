Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "Post-Transformation Machine" or any fictional empire context you might have) empireâ€™s self-evolving autonomy stack can be a fun and intellectually stimulating task. This module should focus on enhancing the autonomous capabilities of the system using recursive strategies to promote self-improvement and adaptation over time. Here is a conceptual outline for such a module.

### Key Features

1. **Strategy Pattern**: The use of an abstract `Strategy` base class allows for easy integration and testing of different self-improving strategies.

2. **Genetic Algorithm**: A simple genetic algorithm model is implemented to demonstrate recursive approaches to autonomy enhancement.

3. **Recursive Self-Improvement**: The `RecursiveSelfImprovement` class orchestrates the strategy's adaptation and evaluation cycles, preserving a history for debugging and analysis.

4. **Logging**: Provides detailed logging throughout to facilitate understanding of internal states and processes, which is essential for debugging and further development.

5. **Extensible**: The design is open to incorporating additional strategies and complexity, enabling more sophisticated machine learning and adaptation techniques.

This module lays the groundwork for further enhancements such as incorporating deep learning, reinforcement learning strategies, or more complex simulation environments to test and refine the autonomy stack.
