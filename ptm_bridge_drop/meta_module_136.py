Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably, "Potential Tactical Maneuvering") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can continuously learn and adapt. Here’s an outline of such a module, which includes innovative recursive strategies:

### Overview

The goal is to create a module named `ptm_autonomy` that focuses on self-improvement through recursive strategies in decision-making, machine learning, and environmental interaction. This module can be used in any autonomous system, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, or adaptive control systems within the PTM empire.

### Key Components

1. **Recursive Learning Framework**: A system that continuously refines its algorithms based on feedback from its environment. 

2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Incorporate machine learning models that adjust strategies based on real-time data and past experiences.

3. **Environmental Interaction**: Enhance awareness and response capabilities, allowing systems to interact dynamically with new and unknown environments.

4. **Modular Architecture**: Enable easy integration with existing systems while allowing for future expansions.

### Module Structure

Here's how the module might be structured:

```python
# ptm_autonomy core module package
ptm_autonomy/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── learning.py
    ├── decision_making.py
    ├── interaction.py
    ├── utils.py
    └── models/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── neural_networks.py
        ├── reinforcement_learning.py
        └── evolutionary_algorithms.py
```

### Key Files and Their Responsibilities

#### `__init__.py`

Initialize the module, define global variables and provide shortcuts for important class and function imports.

#### `learning.py`

Implement the recursive learning framework. Key features include:

- **Feedback Mechanism**: Gather and analyze results from actions.
- **Self-Adjusting Algorithms**: Allow models to change parameters autonomously to improve accuracy.

```python
class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize learning parameters
        pass
    
    def train(self, data):
        # Training logic that adapts over iterations
        pass

    def evaluate(self, feedback):
        # Evaluate results and refine future actions
        pass

    def recursive_improve(self):
        # Strategy to recursively enhance models
        pass
```

#### `decision_making.py`

Develop adaptive decision-making systems that use past data and simulated environments to predict the best actions.

```python
class DecisionEngine:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
    
    def make_decision(self, state):
        # Use model to predict next action
        return predicted_action

    def update_model(self, feedback):
        # Refine model based on feedback
        pass
```

#### `interaction.py`

Enhance interaction capabilities utilizing sensors and real-time analytics.

```python
class EnvironmentInteraction:
    def __init__(self, sensors):
        self.sensors = sensors
    
    def perceive_environment(self):
        # Gather data from environment
        pass

    def respond_to_changes(self):
        # Responsive actions based on changes
        pass
```

#### `utils.py`

Utility functions and shared methods used across the module.

```python
def normalize_data(data):
    # Normalize data for consistent inputs
    pass

def log_metrics(metrics):
    # Log operation metrics for analysis
    pass
```

#### Models Directory

Contains implementations of various machine learning models to support autonomy:

- **neural_networks.py**: Construct neural network architectures suitable for different learning tasks.
- **reinforcement_learning.py**: Implement reinforcement learning strategies, including Q-learning and policy gradient methods.
- **evolutionary_algorithms.py**: Create evolutionary-based approaches to optimize decision-making processes.

### Strategies for Self-Evolution

1. **Recursive Feedback Loops**: Implement continuous feedback loops where the autonomy stack learns from mistakes and successes to improve algorithms.

2. **Simulated Environments**: Create virtual testing environments to explore strategy effectiveness before real-world implementation.

3. **Cooperative AI**: Enable models to communicate and learn from the experiences of parallel systems.

4. **Meta-Learning**: Adopt meta-learning approaches where the system learns how to learn more efficiently over time.

### Conclusion

By integrating recursive strategies and modular design, the `ptm_autonomy` module can significantly enhance the adaptive capabilities of PTM's systems, allowing for autonomous growth and evolution as new challenges arise. This structure allows further customization, scalability, and integration with existing PTM assets.
