Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably Short for a particular entity, which we'll interpret as "Predictive Task Management" for this context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves implementing a sophisticated system architecture that leverages recursive strategies. This can include elements such as machine learning, self-optimization routines, and recursive problem-solving algorithms. Below, let's design a high-level concept of such a Python module:

### Module: Recursive Autonomy Engine (RAE)

#### Key Features:
1. **Self-Learning Mechanism**: Utilizes ML models to adapt and learn from historical data and feedback.
2. **Recursive Task Processing**: Implements recursive strategies for continual improvement and decision-making.
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Analyzes patterns and predicts outcomes to minimize redundant computations through recursive insights.
4. **Modular Architecture**: Uses a modular approach to easily integrate with existing systems in the PTM energy infrastructure.

#### High-Level Structure:
```python
# RAE Module
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

class RecursiveAutonomyEngine:
    def __init__(self, model=None):
        # Initialize with a default machine learning model
        self.model = model if model is not None else RandomForestClassifier()
        self.data = []
    
    def collect_data(self, new_data):
        """Collect data dynamically and keep history for learning"""
        self.data.extend(new_data)
    
    def train_model(self):
        """Train the model using collected data"""
        X, y = self._prepare_data(self.data)
        self.model.fit(X, y)
    
    def predict(self, inputs):
        """Predict outcomes using the trained model"""
        return self.model.predict(inputs)
    
    def recursive_optimize(self, problem):
        """Use recursive strategies to optimize task solving"""
        # Placeholder for complex recursive logic
        if self._is_trivial(problem):
            return self._solve_trivial(problem)
        else:
            sub_problems = self._decompose(problem)
            solutions = [self.recursive_optimize(p) for p in sub_problems]
            return self._combine_solutions(solutions)
    
    def _prepare_data(self, data):
        """Placeholder for data preparation"""
        # Convert data into feature and label arrays
        X = np.array([d['features'] for d in data])
        y = np.array([d['label'] for d in data])
        return X, y
    
    def _decompose(self, problem):
        """Decompose problem into subproblems"""
        # Logic to break down the problem
        return []
    
    def _combine_solutions(self, solutions):
        """Combine solutions of subproblems"""
        # Aggregate subproblem solutions
        return sum(solutions)
    
    def _is_trivial(self, problem):
        """Determine if problem can be solved trivially"""
        return problem in (0, 1)
    
    def _solve_trivial(self, problem):
        """Solve trivial problem directly"""
        return problem
    
# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    rae = RecursiveAutonomyEngine()
    
    # Simulate data collection
    rae.collect_data([
        {'features': [1, 2, 3], 'label': 1},
        {'features': [4, 5, 6], 'label': 0}
    ])
    
    rae.train_model()
    
    prediction = rae.predict([[1, 2, 3]])
    print(f"Predicted: {prediction}")

    # Demonstrate recursive optimization
    result = rae.recursive_optimize(10)  # Example problem
    print(f"Recursive Optimization Result: {result}")
```

#### Explanation:
- **Data Collection and Training**: The module collects data dynamically to feed into the machine learning model, in this case, a `RandomForestClassifier`. This trains the model incrementally for predictions.
  
- **Recursive Problem Solving**: It employs recursive methodologies for resolving tasks. The problem is decomposed into subproblems, solved individually, and then combined to form the complete solution.

- **Interface Methods**: Key methods such as `collect_data`, `train_model`, and `predict` provide interfaces for engaging with the autonomy engine.

- **Extensibility**: Designed to be easily extended with different models and enhanced recursive logic as needed for diverse autonomous tasks in expanding the PTM infrastructure.

This module serves as a prototype with placeholders for more complex logic, demonstrating how you can integrate recursive strategies within an evolving autonomous system.
