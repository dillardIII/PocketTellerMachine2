Expanding the PTM (Presumably, "Predictive Technology Model") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires designing a Python module that not only incorporates cutting-edge machine learning and artificial intelligence strategies but also embraces recursive algorithms for continuous improvement and adaptability. Below is a conceptual design outline for such a module:

### Module Name: `PTM_AutonomyEnhancer`

#### Key Features

1. **Self-Evolving Models**:
    - Incorporate online learning algorithms for models to adapt with new data in real-time.
    - Utilize meta-learning (learning to learn) to improve model adaptability for unfamiliar tasks.

2. **Recursive Improvement Strategies**:
    - Implement recursive neural networks (RNN) and recurrent reinforcement learning for decision optimization.
    - Use recursive data augmentation techniques to enhance data diversity and model robustness.

3. **Autonomous System Framework**:
    - Design an agent-based architecture where each agent can operate autonomously with minimal human intervention.
    - Include a hierarchy of agents enabling recursive feedback loops for system-wide learning and adaptation.

4. **Feedback Loops**:
    - Establish continuous feedback loops that allow models to self-assess their performance using reinforcement signals directly from the system interactions.
    - Implement Bayesian optimization and recursive Bayesian estimation for hyperparameter tuning and uncertainty management.

5. **Adaptive Interface Layer**:
    - Design an interface layer that allows seamless integration with existing PTM systems while recursively suggesting enhancements based on historical performance data and current system state.

6. **Security and Ethics Compliance**:
    - Integrate recursive policy-checking algorithms to ensure that evolving models consistently adhere to predetermined ethical guidelines and security standards.
