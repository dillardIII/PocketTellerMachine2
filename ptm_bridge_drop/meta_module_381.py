Designing a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably, "Potential Theoretical Model" or similar) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves leveraging advanced algorithms and techniques that facilitate self-improvement, decision-making, and adaptability. The focus will be on recursive strategies, which are essential for implementing self-evolving capabilities. Below is a conceptual outline and a simple example to guide you in building such a module:

### Key Objectives:
1. **Integration of Recursive Learning**:
   - Implement recursive strategies to improve learning efficiency and adaptability.
   - Enhance decision-making by exploring multiple levels of abstraction.

2. **Self-Optimization**:
   - Develop algorithms that can assess their performance and optimize accordingly.
   - Use reinforcement learning or genetic algorithms for optimization.

3. **Dynamic Adaptation**:
   - Enable the system to adapt to new environments and situations dynamically.
   - Employ anomaly detection to trigger adaptive responses.

4. **Modular Architecture**:
   - Design the module in a way that it can be easily integrated with existing systems.
   - Ensure scalability to accommodate new functionalities.

### Conceptual Implementation:

```python
# AutonomousEntity.py
import random
import numpy as np

class AutonomousEntity:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = None
        self.recursive_depth = 3
        self.learning_rate = 0.1

    def perceive_environment(self, environment):
        """
        Simulate perception by creating an initial state from the environment.
        """
        self.state = environment.get_initial_state()
        
    def recursive_strategy(self, current_state, depth):
        """
        Recursive function to explore possible future states and reward them.
        """
        if depth == 0:
            return self.evaluate_state(current_state)

        possible_states = self.generate_possible_states(current_state)
        best_reward = float('-inf')
        
        for state in possible_states:
            predicted_reward = self.recursive_strategy(state, depth - 1)
            if predicted_reward > best_reward:
                best_reward = predicted_reward

        return best_reward

    def generate_possible_states(self, state):
        """
        Generate possible states from the current state (placeholder for actual logic).
        """
        # Placeholder for logic to generate new states
        return [state + random.random() for _ in range(5)]
    
    def evaluate_state(self, state):
        """
        Evaluate the desirability of a state (placeholder for actual logic).
        """
        # Placeholder for logic to evaluate state
        return -abs(state - target)

    def adapt(self, feedback):
        """
        Adapt the entity based on feedback using simple learning strategy.
        """
        self.learning_rate += feedback * self.learning_rate
        self.recursive_depth = max(1, self.recursive_depth + int(feedback))

    def evolve(self, environment, iterations=100):
        """
        Main loop for the entity to operate in a dynamic environment.
        """
        for _ in range(iterations):
            self.perceive_environment(environment)
            reward = self.recursive_strategy(self.state, self.recursive_depth)

            # Simulate feedback mechanism
            feedback = reward - random.uniform(0, 1)
            self.adapt(feedback)
            
            print(f"Current State: {self.state}, Reward: {reward}, Feedback: {feedback}")

# Sample environment definition
class Environment:
    def get_initial_state(self):
        return random.uniform(0, 10)

# Set a target for demonstration purposes
target = 5.0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    environment = Environment()
    autonomous_entity = AutonomousEntity()
    autonomous_entity.evolve(environment)
```

### Strategies Explained:
- **Recursive Learning**: Implemented through the `recursive_strategy` function, it explores future potential states to determine the best course of action.
- **Self-Optimization**: Feedback is generated comparing reward to random noise, leading to dynamic adjustments in learning rate and recursive depth.
- **Modularity**: The module is designed to interact with a basic `Environment` class, which can be expanded or substituted for integration into complex systems.
- **Innovation**: The combination of recursive depth adjustment, and dynamic adaptation represents a self-evolving capability allowing the module to improve autonomously.

### Future Expansions:
- Incorporating machine learning techniques such as deep reinforcement learning for more sophisticated decision-making.
- Adding anomaly detection to identify and respond to unexpected changes in the environment.
- Extending the module with more complex state and action evaluation metrics to handle a wider range of applications.
  
This is a foundational template. Further development should focus on refining decision-making mechanisms, optimizing performance, and ensuring the system's robustness in real-world scenarios.
