Designing a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably the "PTM" refers to a hypothetical or fictional entity) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack can be an exciting endeavor. The goal here will be to create a system capable of recursively improving itself by learning from its environment and its own past states. The module will focus on recursive strategies involving self-optimization, autonomous learning, and environmental interaction.

Below is a high-level design description for such a Python module:

### Design Overview

#### Module Name
`auto_evolver`

#### Key Components

1. **Environment Interface (`environment.py`)**
   - Provides a standardized interface to interact with various environments (real-world or simulated).
   - Supports feedback loops to measure performance metrics.
  
2. **Agent (`agent.py`)**
   - Includes self-optimizing algorithms based on reinforcement learning.
   - Features a neural network-based decision-making engine capable of recursively improving strategies.
  
3. **Learning Module (`learner.py`)**
   - Contains implementations of advanced reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., DDPG, PPO).
   - Employs meta-learning techniques to accelerate learning processes.
   - Incorporates evolutionary strategies for hyperparameter optimization.

4. **Recursive Strategy Engine (`recursive_engine.py`)**
   - Analyzes historical performance data to identify improvement areas.
   - Implements a recursive feedback loop that enables the system to iterate and evolve its learning strategies.

5. **Data Management (`data_manager.py`)**
   - Manages state and performance data storage.
   - Facilitates data-driven insights into the iterative learning process.

6. **Monitor and Evaluation (`monitor.py`)**
   - Monitors system performance metrics continuously.
   - Provides real-time and post-run analysis of system efficiency and learning progress.

#### Module Interactions

- The **Agent** uses the **Environment Interface** to interact with environments, receiving state data and sending actions.
- The **Learning Module** updates the Agentâ€™s decision-making processes using reinforcement signals and optimization techniques.
- The **Recursive Strategy Engine** iteratively refines these processes by analyzing past performance and adjusting learning parameters.
- The **Data Management** component logs essential data for future analysis, ensuring the system learns from past experiences effectively.
- **Monitor and Evaluation** expose performance metrics and provide insights that guide recursive strategy adjustments.

### Code Sample: Recursive Strategy Engine

Here's a simplified version of the recursive strategy engine to give you a starting point:

```python
# recursive_engine.py
import logging
from learner import Learner
from data_manager import DataManager

class RecursiveEngine:
    def __init__(self, learner: Learner, data_manager: DataManager, recursion_depth: int = 3):
        self.learner = learner
        self.data_manager = data_manager
        self.recursion_depth = recursion_depth
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
        
    def evolve(self):
        logging.info("Starting evolution process...")
        for depth in range(self.recursion_depth):
            logging.info(f"Recursive Iteration: {depth+1}")
            self.learner.train()
            performance = self.data_manager.evaluate_performance()
            if self.is_performance_satisfactory(performance):
                logging.info("Satisfactory performance reached. Stopping evolution.")
                break
            self.adjust_learning_parameters(depth + 1)
    
    def is_performance_satisfactory(self, performance):
        # Define a criteria to determine if performance is satisfactory
        return performance['reward'] > 100  # Example threshold

    def adjust_learning_parameters(self, iteration):
        # Adjust parameters based on past performance (multi-armed bandits, hyperparameter tuning)
        logging.info(f"Adjusting parameters for iteration {iteration}...")
        # Example of parameter adjustment logic
        self.learner.update_learning_rate(0.1 / (iteration + 1))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    learner = Learner()
    data_manager = DataManager()
    engine = RecursiveEngine(learner, data_manager)
    engine.evolve()
```

### Conclusion

This module provides a holistic yet flexible approach to self-evolving autonomy that adapts with every iteration, ensuring scalability and robustness. The recursive feedback system ensures continuous refinement of the decision-making strategy, promoting a higher degree of autonomy for the PTM empire.
