Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves incorporating innovative recursive strategies to improve decision-making, adaptability, and learning capabilities. Below is a conceptualization of such a module, focusing on recursive learning, adaptive strategies, and autonomous decision-making enhancements.

```python
# ptm_autonomy.py

import numpy as np
import random

class PTMAutonomy:

    def __init__(self, initial_state):
        self.state = initial_state
        self.learning_rate = 0.1
        self.discount_factor = 0.9
        self.q_table = {}  # For storing Q-values
        self.history = []  # To keep track of decisions

    def initialize_q_table(self, states, actions):
        """ Initialize Q-table with a state-action pair dictionary. """
        for state in states:
            self.q_table[state] = {action: 0 for action in actions}

    def choose_action(self, state, actions, epsilon=0.2):
        """ Choose action based on epsilon-greedy policy. """
        if random.uniform(0, 1) < epsilon:
            return random.choice(actions)
        q_values = self.q_table.get(state, {action: 0 for action in actions})
        return max(q_values, key=q_values.get)

    def update_q_table(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        """ Update Q-value for a given state-action pair. """
        q_current = self.q_table[state][action]
        q_max_next = max(self.q_table.get(next_state, {}).values())
        q_new = q_current + self.learning_rate * (reward + self.discount_factor * q_max_next - q_current)
        self.q_table[state][action] = q_new
        self.history.append((state, action, reward, q_new))

    def recursive_planning(self, state, depth):
        """ Recursive strategy to plan and evaluate possible future states. """
        if depth == 0 or state not in self.q_table:
            return 0

        action = self.choose_action(state, self.q_table[state].keys())
        reward = self.simulate_environment(action)
        next_state = self.transition(state, action)

        future_reward = self.recursive_planning(next_state, depth - 1)
        
        return reward + self.discount_factor * future_reward

    def simulate_environment(self, action):
        """ Placeholder for environment simulation given an action. """
        # Assume some logic here that simulates the environment and returns a reward.
        return random.uniform(-1, 1)

    def transition(self, state, action):
        """ Placeholder to simulate state transition based on action taken. """
        # This would ideally be a model of your environment's dynamics.
        return state  # In a real scenario, you'd calculate and return the next state here.

    def self_evolve(self, iterations=100):
        """ Conduct self-evolution using recursive learning strategies. """
        for i in range(iterations):
            state = self.state
            while self.is_terminal(state) is False:
                action = self.choose_action(state, self.q_table[state].keys())
                reward = self.simulate_environment(action)
                next_state = self.transition(state, action)

                # Update Q-table with reward and future state
                self.update_q_table(state, action, reward, next_state)
                state = next_state

                # Recursively plan and update strategy
                self.recursive_planning(state, depth=3)

    def is_terminal(self, state):
        """ Check if the current state is terminal. """
        # Placeholder logic for terminal state check
        return False

    def report_history(self):
        """ Provide a detailed report of historical actions, rewards, and Q-values. """
        for record in self.history:
            print(f"State: {record[0]}, Action: {record[1]}, Reward: {record[2]}, Updated Q-value: {record[3]}")

    def adapt_learning_rate(self, performance_metric):
        """ Adapt learning rate based on performance metrics to evolve learning policy. """
        if performance_metric > self.previous_performance:
            self.learning_rate *= 1.1
        else:
            self.learning_rate *= 0.9
        self.previous_performance = performance_metric

# Example usage
states = ['A', 'B', 'C']
actions = ['move_left', 'move_right', 'stay']

autonomy_module = PTMAutonomy(initial_state='A')
autonomy_module.initialize_q_table(states, actions)
autonomy_module.self_evolve(iterations=100)
autonomy_module.report_history()
```

### Key Features:

1. **Q-learning with Epsilon-Greedy Strategy**: Balances exploration and exploitation using a randomly-selected action with probability epsilon, otherwise choosing the best known action.

2. **Recursive Planning**: Implements a recursive planning mechanism for evaluating future rewards up to a certain depth, allowing the system to anticipate long-term effects of actions.

3. **Adaptive Learning Rate**: Modifies the learning rate based on performance metrics to dynamically adjust the learning pace of the module.

4. **State Transition and Environment Simulation**: Placeholder functions simulate the environment responses to decisions, which should be replaced with actual models reflecting real-world dynamics.

5. **Decision History Tracking**: History of actions and Q-values provides insights into decision-making processes and efficacy over time.

To enhance this design, further integration with real-world data sources for deep learning and real-time adaptation could be explored, making the autonomy stack even more robust and self-improving.
