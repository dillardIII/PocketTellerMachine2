Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably referring to a theoretical organization or system) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack can be an exciting and complex task. The idea would be to engineer a module that can adapt and evolve over time, using recursive strategies to continuously improve its functionality. Here's a conceptual framework and design for such a module:

### Module Name: **ptm_self_evolver**

#### Key Components:

1. **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**
   - Capable of handling diverse data sources.
   - Employs preprocessing techniques to clean and transform raw data into useful information.

2. **Recursive Learning Engine**
   - Uses algorithms that can recursively break down complex tasks into simpler, solvable units.
   - Incorporates a feedback loop to adjust models and strategies based on performance metrics and outcomes.

3. **Adaptive Model Selection**
   - Utilizes meta-learning to select and configure models best suited for the given tasks.
   - Implements modular neural architecture search (NAS) to explore and identify optimal neural network architectures.

4. **Self-Optimization**
   - A component for continuous optimization of operational parameters using techniques like genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning.
   - Capable of adjusting based on resource availability and task requirements.

5. **Autonomous Decision Making**
   - Driven by a knowledge graph to infer new relationships and derive insights.
   - Implements an action-suggestion engine that auto-tunes its decision policies based on historical and real-time data.

6. **Scalable Deployment Engine**
   - Ensures seamless horizontal and vertical scaling across distributed systems.
   - Incorporates containerization strategies like Docker and orchestration using Kubernetes (K8s) for robust deployment.

7. **Security and Governance**
   - Implements security protocols to ensure data integrity and privacy.
   - Incorporates governance frameworks for compliance and ethical AI guidelines.

8. **API Layer**
   - Provides robust RESTful and, optionally, GraphQL APIs for easy integration with external systems.
   - Includes authentication, rate limiting, and logging functionalities.

#### Implementation Outline:

```python
# ptm_self_evolver module

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow import keras
from evolutionary_search import EvolutionaryAlgorithmSearchCV
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

class PTMSelfEvolver:
    def __init__(self, data_sources, initial_models):
        self.data_sources = data_sources
        self.models = initial_models
        self.current_data = None
        self.model_score_history = {}

    def ingest_data(self):
        # Implement data ingestion logic
        self.current_data = pd.concat([source.load() for source in self.data_sources])
        self.current_data = self.preprocess_data(self.current_data)

    def preprocess_data(self, data):
        # Implement data preprocessing logic
        data = data.dropna()
        # Additional preprocessing steps
        return data

    def recursive_learning(self):
        # Recursive learning using self model
        X, y = self.current_data.drop('target', axis=1), self.current_data['target']
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
        
        for model in self.models:
            model.fit(X_train, y_train)
            score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
            self.model_score_history[model] = score

    def adaptive_model_selection(self):
        # Implement logic for selecting models based on historical performance
        pass

    def self_optimize(self):
        # Implement recursive optimization logic
        pca = PCA(n_components=5).fit_transform(self.current_data)
        # Further optimization processes

    def make_decision(self):
        # Decision making based on processed data and learning
        decision = np.random.choice(['Action1', 'Action2'])
        return decision

    def deploy(self):
        # Logic to handle scalable deployment
        pass

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    data_sources = []  # Define the data sources
    initial_models = [DecisionTreeClassifier()]
    evolver = PTMSelfEvolver(data_sources, initial_models)
    evolver.ingest_data()
    evolver.recursive_learning()
    selected_action = evolver.make_decision()
    evolver.deploy()
```

### Explanation:

- **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**: The module begins by ingesting data from specified sources and preprocessing it to ensure it's clean and ready for analysis.

- **Recursive Learning Engine**: The `recursive_learning` function trains models on data, evaluating their performance iteratively.

- **Adaptive Model Selection & Optimization**: While a stub here, this would involve selecting models dynamically based on performance data and applying dimensional reduction and optimization techniques.

- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Based on model insights, decisions are made in an autonomous manner, potentially introducing randomness or probabilistic decision-making to add variability/flexibility.

- **Scaling and Deployment**: Though not filled in detail, this component would use modern practices for deploying machine learning models at scale.

This design is modular and extensible, enabling further enhancements and integration into a larger system like the PTM empire's stack.
