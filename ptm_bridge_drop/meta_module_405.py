Creating a new Python module for the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves developing a system that can learn, adapt, and optimize itself over time using recursive strategies. Below is a high-level design of such a module, incorporating innovative recursive strategies:

### Module: self_evolver

#### Key Features:
1. **Recursive Learning Mechanism**:
   - Allows the system to continuously learn and improve its algorithms based on new data and experiences.

2. **Genetic Algorithms**:
   - Use genetic algorithms to evolve solutions over generations, optimizing for specified goals.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Implement reinforcement learning to enable the system to make decisions based on trial and error feedback.

4. **Meta-Learning**:
   - Develop models that can improve their learning efficiency by understanding and optimizing their learning process.

5. **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Utilize recursive Bayesian Optimization for automatic tuning of model hyperparameters to improve performance.

6. **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**:
   - Implement NAS to automatically design and optimize neural network architectures.

7. **Feedback Loop Integration**:
   - Continuous feedback loops that allow the system to adjust strategies based on performance metrics and external inputs.

#### Module Structure:

```python
# self_evolver/__init__.py

from .recursive_learner import RecursiveLearner
from .genetic_optimizer import GeneticOptimizer
from .reinforcement_agent import ReinforcementAgent
from .meta_learner import MetaLearner
from .hyperparameter_tuner import HyperparameterTuner
from .nas_module import NASModule

__all__ = [
    "RecursiveLearner",
    "GeneticOptimizer",
    "ReinforcementAgent",
    "MetaLearner",
    "HyperparameterTuner",
    "NASModule",
]

```

#### Module Components:

1. **Recursive Learner**:
   - A class that encapsulates recursive learning strategies, updating models based on incoming data.

    ```python
    # self_evolver/recursive_learner.py

    class RecursiveLearner:
        def __init__(self):
            self.model = None
        
        def update_model(self, data):
            # Recursive learning logic
            pass
        
        def evaluate_model(self, test_data):
            # Evaluate the current model
            pass
    ```

2. **Genetic Optimizer**:
   - Utilizes genetic algorithms for evolving and optimizing solutions.

    ```python
    # self_evolver/genetic_optimizer.py

    class GeneticOptimizer:
        def __init__(self, population_size, mutation_rate):
            self.population_size = population_size
            self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate
            self.population = self.initialize_population()
        
        def initialize_population(self):
            # Initialize a population of potential solutions
            pass

        def evolve_population(self):
            # Apply genetic operations to evolve the population
            pass
    ```

3. **Reinforcement Agent**:
   - Implements agents that learn optimal actions through rewards and penalties.

    ```python
    # self_evolver/reinforcement_agent.py

    class ReinforcementAgent:
        def __init__(self, environment):
            self.environment = environment
            self.policy = None
        
        def train_agent(self, episodes):
            # Reinforcement learning training logic
            pass
        
        def evaluate_agent(self):
            # Evaluate the agent's performance
            pass
    ```

4. **Meta Learner**:
   - Focuses on improving the learning process itself.

    ```python
    # self_evolver/meta_learner.py

    class MetaLearner:
        def __init__(self, base_learner):
            self.base_learner = base_learner
        
        def optimize_learning_process(self):
            # Optimize the learning process of the base learner
            pass
    ```

5. **Hyperparameter Tuner**:
   - Implements automatic hyperparameter optimization.

    ```python
    # self_evolver/hyperparameter_tuner.py

    class HyperparameterTuner:
        def __init__(self, model):
            self.model = model
        
        def tune_parameters(self):
            # Use Bayesian optimization or other methodologies to tune hyperparameters
            pass
    ```

6. **NAS Module**:
   - Automates the design and optimization of neural network architectures.

    ```python
    # self_evolver/nas_module.py

    class NASModule:
        def __init__(self):
            self.best_architecture = None
        
        def search_architecture(self):
            # Neural architecture search logic
            pass
        
        def evaluate_architecture(self, data):
            # Evaluate the found architecture's performance
            pass
    ```

#### Implementation Considerations:
- **Scalability**: Ensure the module is scalable to handle large datasets and complex environments.
- **Integration**: Allow for seamless integration with existing systems and modules within the PTM empire.
- **Modularity**: Keep components modular for ease of updates and debugging.
- **Security**: Implement robust security measures to protect the system from external threats.

This design outlines a comprehensive framework for an autonomy stack, promoting adaptability and continuous improvement through recursive strategies.
