Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (which could stand for anything from Pathfinding Technology Module to Predictive Traffic Management, depending on the context) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating innovative recursive strategies and ensuring that the system can learn and evolve independently. Here’s a high-level design of such a module:

### Module: `pta_autonomy`

#### Key Features:

1. **Recursive Learning Framework**:
   - **Self-Optimizing Algorithms**: Implement algorithms that improve through recursive feedback loops, using historical data to adjust parameters.
   - **Dynamic Goal Setting**: Set objectives that evolve based on the success metrics of previous iterations.

2. **Multi-Layer Neural Network**:
   - **Deep Learning Integration**: Utilize TensorFlow or PyTorch to handle complex autonomy tasks.
   - **Recursive Neural Networks**: Employ RNNs to manage sequential data inputs, enabling the system to remember previous states for better decision-making.

3. **Environment Simulation**:
   - **Virtual Testing Grounds**: Simulate different scenarios for the modules to learn and iterate upon, using libraries like OpenAI Gym for diverse environments.
   - **Feedback-Driven Iteration**: Implement a test-evaluate-learn cycle to refine strategies in real-time.

4. **Autonomous Control Systems**:
   - **Distributed Control Architecture**: Use microservices with RESTful APIs to manage diverse autonomous agents.
   - **Adaptive Pathfinding**: Leverage A* or Dijkstra algorithms with enhancements from machine learning to adapt routes dynamically.

5. **Data Management and Analytics**:
   - **Big Data Processing**: Use Apache Spark or similar frameworks to process large datasets for better predictive analytics.
   - **Anomaly Detection**: Incorporate unsupervised learning techniques to identify and react to outliers.

6. **Recursive Improvement System**:
   - **Self-Assessment Nodes**: Establish checkpoints within the system to evaluate performance against benchmarks.
   - **Automated Parameter Tuning**: Implement recursive tuning algorithms that adjust neural network weights based on outcome analysis.

7. **Safety and Compliance**:
   - **Risk Assessment Models**: Use probabilistic models to evaluate the potential risks linked to autonomous operations.
   - **Compliance Layer**: Ensure the module adheres to regulatory standards using rule-based systems.

#### Example Code Structure

```python
# pta_autonomy/__init__.py

class PTMAutonomy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.learning_model = self.build_learning_model()
        self.simulation_environment = self.build_simulation_environment()

    def build_learning_model(self):
        # Initialize a recursive neural network
        import torch.nn as nn

        class RecursiveModel(nn.Module):
            def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
                super(RecursiveModel, self).__init__()
                self.hidden_size = hidden_size
                self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size)
                self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

            def forward(self, x, hidden):
                out, hidden = self.rnn(x, hidden)
                out = self.fc(out)
                return out, hidden

        model = RecursiveModel(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, output_size=1)
        return model

    def build_simulation_environment(self):
        # Setup virtual testing environment
        import gym
        env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')  # Example environment
        return env

    def run_simulation(self):
        # Run simulations to optimize strategies
        observation = self.simulation_environment.reset()
        for _ in range(1000):
            self.simulation_environment.render()
            action = self.simulation_environment.action_space.sample()
            observation, reward, done, info = self.simulation_environment.step(action)
            if done:
                observation = self.simulation_environment.reset()
        self.simulation_environment.close()

    def optimize_parameters(self):
        # Recursive tuning based on collected data
        pass  # Implement optimization logic

```

### Additional Considerations:
- **Scalability**: Design should consider cloud-based deployments for scalability.
- **Interoperability**: Ensure compatibility with existing systems via robust API design.
- **Security**: Incorporate security protocols to safeguard data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.

This design framework forms the skeleton of an advanced autonomy stack that adapts, learns recursively, and enhances its operational efficiency autonomously. The specific implementation details would need to be aligned with PTM’s objectives and technological environment.
