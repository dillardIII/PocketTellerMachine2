Designing a Python module to expand PTM (Presumably an abbreviation you've defined) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can learn, adapt, and evolve by leveraging innovative recursive strategies. Here's a high-level design for such a module, incorporating concepts like recursive learning, self-improvement loops, and self-assessment mechanisms.

### PTM AutonomyStack Module Design

```python
# Let's define the core structure of the autonomy stack module

class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = {}
        self.evolution_log = []
        self.recursive_strategies = []

    def add_recursive_strategy(self, strategy):
        """Add a new recursive strategy to the stack."""
        self.recursive_strategies.append(strategy)
        print(f"Added new strategy: {strategy.__name__}")

    def execute_strategies(self):
        """Execute all recursive strategies in the stack."""
        for strategy in self.recursive_strategies:
            print(f"Executing strategy: {strategy.__name__}")
            strategy(self)

    def evolve(self):
        """Evolve the current state based on executed strategies."""
        self.record_current_state()
        self.execute_strategies()
        self.improve_self()
        self.self_assessment()
        
    def improve_self(self):
        """Implement self-improvement based on feedback and logging."""
        # Placeholder for an improvement algorithm
        print("Improving based on self-assessment and previous evolution logs.")
        
    def self_assessment(self):
        """Assess the current states to determine next improvements."""
        # Placeholder for assessment logic
        print("Performing self-assessment to guide future evolutions.")

    def record_current_state(self):
        """Log the current state to track evolution."""
        state_copy = self.state.copy()
        self.evolution_log.append(state_copy)
        print(f"Recorded state: {state_copy}")

    def state_update_hook(self, update_function):
        """Wrap state updates to ensure recursive consistency."""
        def wrapped_update(*args, **kwargs):
            result = update_function(*args, **kwargs)
            self.state = result if result else self.state  # Update state if not None
            return result
        return wrapped_update

# Example Recursive Strategy
def example_strategy(autonomy_stack):
    """Example strategy that modifies the autonomy stack state recursively."""
    @autonomy_stack.state_update_hook
    def update_state():
        current_value = autonomy_stack.state.get("value", 0)
        new_value = current_value + 1  # Simple recursive increment
        return {"value": new_value}

    print(f"Updating state using example_strategy. Current state: {autonomy_stack.state}")
    update_state()

# Using the Module
autonomy_stack = AutonomyStack()

# Add strategies
autonomy_stack.add_recursive_strategy(example_strategy)

# Evolve the autonomy stack
autonomy_stack.evolve()
```

### Explanation and Innovations

1. **Recursive Strategies:**
   - The module supports adding recursive strategies that apply transformations to the internal state. Each strategy can influence the module's state recursively and is executed in a loop during the evolution process.

2. **State Management with Hooks:**
   - The `state_update_hook` decorator ensures that changes to the state are consistent and traceable. This design allows each strategy to modify the system's state while being encapsulated, aiding in preventing unintended alterations.

3. **Self-Improvement and Assessment:**
   - The `improve_self` and `self_assessment` functions are placeholders for complex algorithms that analyze the evolution log to adjust strategies and enhance performance based on feedback.

4. **Evolution Log:**
   - Every change in state is logged into the evolution log, allowing the module to trace back through changes, understand the impact of each strategy execution, and guide future improvements.

This design is a foundational structure for building a self-evolving autonomy stack capable of extending and modifying its strategies. To expand its functionality further, advanced machine learning techniques, rule-based systems, and probabilistic methods may be integrated to enhance decision-making processes in self-assessment and recursive strategies.
