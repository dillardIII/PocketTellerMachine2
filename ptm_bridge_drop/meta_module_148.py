Creating a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably, Permission, Tracking, and Management or another specific domain) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves developing a design that incorporates innovative recursive strategies. The goal here is to create an architecture that allows the system to adapt over time, learning and optimizing its processes autonomously. Below is a conceptual design for such a module:

### Module: Evolver

#### Overview

The `Evolver` module is designed to enhance the self-evolving autonomy stack by implementing recursive strategies that allow the system to continuously learn, adapt, and optimize itself based on environmental feedback and predefined objectives.

#### Key Components

1. **Adaptive Learning Engine (ALE):**
   - **Purpose:** Continuously learns from incoming data and refines its models to make better predictions or decisions.
   - **Techniques Used:**
     - Supervised and unsupervised learning.
     - Reinforcement learning for adaptive decision-making.
     - Recursive neural networks for modeling sequential dependencies.

2. **Recursive Strategy Executor (RSE):**
   - **Purpose:** Implements self-improving strategies that leverage recursive algorithms to refine operations and optimize outcomes.
   - **Techniques Used:**
     - Dynamic programming for solving optimization problems.
     - Recursive function calls for complex calculations.
     - Backtracking for exploring solution spaces.

3. **Feedback Integration System (FIS):**
   - **Purpose:** Aggregates feedback from the operating environment and adjusts module parameters accordingly.
   - **Techniques Used:**
     - Continuous monitoring using sensors or software logs.
     - Feedback loops for real-time system adjustments.
     - Anomaly detection algorithms to identify and correct deviations.

4. **Module Interface (MI):**
   - **Purpose:** Provides a standardized API for communicating with other components of the autonomy stack.
   - **Techniques Used:**
     - RESTful API for external interactions.
     - Pub/Sub model for internal event handling.
     - GraphQL for flexible query options.

#### Innovative Recursive Strategies

- **Self-Recursion Algorithms:**
  - Develop algorithms that recursively refine their logic based on past executions, leveraging historical data to predict future actions.

- **Recursive Feedback Loops:**
  - Implement feedback loops that operate recursively, allowing the system to evaluate outcomes and adjust strategies dynamically.

- **Multi-layered Recursive Models:**
  - Develop models that recursively combine outputs from different layers, improving the accuracy and robustness of decisions.

#### Example Code Structure

```python
class AdaptiveLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize model parameters
        pass

    def train(self, data):
        # Train models using incoming data
        pass

    def predict(self, input_data):
        # Make predictions based on learned models
        return prediction


class RecursiveStrategyExecutor:
    def optimize(self, task):
        # Implement recursive optimization strategies
        pass

    def execute(self, strategy):
        # Execute strategy using recursive logic
        return result


class FeedbackIntegrationSystem:
    def gather_feedback(self):
        # Collect feedback from environment
        pass

    def adjust_parameters(self, feedback):
        # Adjust module parameters based on feedback
        pass


class Evolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ale = AdaptiveLearningEngine()
        self.rse = RecursiveStrategyExecutor()
        self.fis = FeedbackIntegrationSystem()

    def evolve(self, data, strategy):
        self.ale.train(data)
        prediction = self.ale.predict(data)
        
        feedback = self.fis.gather_feedback()
        self.fis.adjust_parameters(feedback)
        
        result = self.rse.execute(strategy)
        return prediction, result


# Example usage
evolver = Evolver()
data, strategy = None, None  # Placeholder for input data and strategy
evolver.evolve(data, strategy)
```

### Conclusion

The `Evolver` module is designed to become the backbone of a self-evolving autonomy stack for the PTM empire. By leveraging innovative recursive strategies and a robust feedback system, this module aims to enhance adaptive capabilities, improve decision-making, and embrace autonomous evolution.

This design is abstract and lays the foundation for a module that would need to be tailored to specific use cases and contexts within the PTM empire's operational sphere.
