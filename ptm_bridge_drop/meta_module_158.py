Creating a Python module for a self-evolving autonomy stack involves several steps. The module should be designed to promote self-improvement, adaptability, and robustness. Below is a conceptual outline and sample implementation that incorporates recursive strategies, allowing for continuous evolution and optimization of algorithms.

### Conceptual Design

1. **Module Structure**:
   - The module is divided into key components:
       - **Data Acquisition**: Gathers data from various sources to be used for training and evaluation.
       - **Model Training**: Trains models using acquired data.
       - **Self-Evaluation**: Continuously evaluates the performance of models and identifies areas for improvement.
       - **Optimization**: Implements recursive strategies to refine models and adapt to new information.
       - **Feedback Loop**: Provides feedback mechanisms that allow the system to learn from its environment and user interactions.

2. **Recursive Strategies**:
   - **Recursive Learning**: Models can retrain on new data incrementally, improving efficiency and avoiding the need to relearn from scratch.
   - **Algorithm Evolution**: Use genetic algorithms to iteratively test and refine models, selecting the most promising ones for further development.
   - **Automated Feature Selection**: Continuously evaluate which features contribute most to model performance, adjusting the input features dynamically.

3. **Self-Evolving Characteristics**:
   - **Adaptation**: Responds to changes in the environment by automatically updating its predictions.
   - **Scalability**: Capable of scaling resources up or down based on computational needs.
   - **Decentralized Control**: Implements a decentralized decision-making process to improve resilience and reduce latency.

### Sample Implementation

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import numpy as np
import random

class SelfEvolvingModule:
    def __init__(self, initial_data, target, model=None):
        self.data = initial_data
        self.target = target
        self.model = model if model else RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10)
        self.history = []

    def recursive_feature_selection(self):
        # Placeholder for a feature selection method
        selected_features = self.data.columns[:int(len(self.data.columns) / 2)]
        self.data = self.data[selected_features]
        print(f"Selected features: {selected_features}")

    def recursive_learning(self):
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(self.data, self.target, test_size=0.2)
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions = self.model.predict(X_test)
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
        self.history.append(accuracy)
        print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")

    def self_evaluate(self):
        # Placeholder for self-evaluation logic
        last_performance = self.history[-1] if self.history else 0
        if last_performance < 0.8:
            print("Performance below threshold. Re-evaluating...")
            self.recursive_learning()

    def evolve(self):
        print("Starting evolution cycle...")
        while not self.converged():
            self.recursive_feature_selection()
            self.recursive_learning()
            self.self_evaluate()

    def converged(self):
        if len(self.history) < 5:
            return False
        recent_history = self.history[-5:]
        # Check for convergence (very simple convergence check)
        return all(abs(recent_history[i] - recent_history[i+1]) < 0.01 for i in range(len(recent_history) - 1))

# Example usage
# Assume `data` is your input DataFrame and `target` is your target labels
# data, target = ...
# module = SelfEvolvingModule(data, target)
# module.evolve()
```

This implementation outlines a basic framework for a self-evolving module. It's a highly adaptable system capable of recursive improvement, which is essential for building a scalable and autonomous empire like PTM. Further development would involve exploring advanced machine learning techniques, integrating more complex feedback mechanisms, and expanding feature engineering capabilities.
