Below is a Python script file that implements a simple trading strategy. The strategy uses moving averages to generate buy and sell signals. This script assumes you are familiar with obtaining and handling stock price data, and it's intended to be expanded or integrated with your existing data acquisition methods.

```python
# trading_strategy_0.py

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def calculate_moving_average(price_series, window_size):
    """
    Calculates the moving average of a given series.
    
    :param price_series: Pandas Series of prices.
    :param window_size: The window size for the moving average.
    :return: Pandas Series of moving averages.
    """
    return price_series.rolling(window=window_size).mean()

def trading_strategy(data, short_window=40, long_window=100):
    """
    Implements a simple moving average crossover trading strategy.
    
    :param data: DataFrame with a 'Price' column.
    :param short_window: The window size for the short-term moving average.
    :param long_window: The window size for the long-term moving average.
    :return: DataFrame with buy and sell signals.
    """
    
    # Ensure 'Price' column exists
    if 'Price' not in data.columns:
        raise ValueError("Data does not contain 'Price' column")

    # Calculate moving averages
    data['Short_MA'] = calculate_moving_average(data['Price'], short_window)
    data['Long_MA'] = calculate_moving_average(data['Price'], long_window)

    # Generate signals
    data['Signal'] = 0
    data.loc[data['Short_MA'] > data['Long_MA'], 'Signal'] = 1
    data.loc[data['Short_MA'] < data['Long_MA'], 'Signal'] = -1
    
    # Generate buy/sell signals
    data['Trade'] = data['Signal'].diff()
    data['Action'] = np.where(data['Trade'] == 1, 'Buy', 
                              np.where(data['Trade'] == -1, 'Sell', ''))

    # Dropna to clean up the data
    data.dropna(inplace=True)
    
    return data

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Example usage (with sample data as placeholder)
    # In a real scenario, replace this with fetched data.
    sample_data = {
        'Price': [100 + np.sin(x/10) * 10 for x in range(200)]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(sample_data)
    
    # Execute the strategy
    signal_df = trading_strategy(df)
    
    # Print buy and sell signals
    print(signal_df[['Price', 'Short_MA', 'Long_MA', 'Action']].loc[signal_df['Action'] != ''])
```

### Key Components:
- **calculate_moving_average**: This function computes the moving average over a specified window.
- **trading_strategy**: This implements a simple moving average crossover strategy. It uses short and long moving averages to generate buy and sell signals.
- **Sample Data**: The script contains an example using synthetic data. Replace it with your data source to test the strategy.

### Usage:
1. Ensure you have pandas and numpy installed (`pip install pandas numpy`).
2. Replace the sample data with actual historical price data.
3. Run the script to see buy and sell signals based on moving average crossovers.

**Note**: This script is a basic framework and should be adapted with more complexity and risk management before being used for real trading.
