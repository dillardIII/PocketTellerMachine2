Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictitious entity) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack can be an exciting endeavor, particularly when integrating recursive strategies to enhance self-evolution. Below is a high-level overview and some illustrative code snippets for such a module:

### Module: `self_evolving_autonomy`

Our goal is to design a module that focuses on recursive strategies for continuous improvement and adaptation. We’ll include features such as evolutionary algorithms, self-modifying code, and recursive learning strategies.

#### Key Features:
1. **Recursive Learning Strategy**: Implement strategies where the module can learn from its experiences and modify its behavior.
   
2. **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Use genetic algorithms to simulate evolution and help the system adapt and optimize.
   
3. **Self-modifying Code**: Allow the software to rewrite parts of itself to improve or adapt functionality.
   
4. **Feedback Loops**: Implement mechanisms for monitoring performance and feeding results back into the system for improvement.

#### High-Level Architecture:

1. **Environment Interface**: A set of APIs to interact with the world and collect feedback.
2. **Evolutionary Engine**: The core mechanism facilitating recursive evolution and optimization.
3. **Learning Agents**: Modules that learn from the environment and evolve over time.
4. **Monitoring System**: Continuously monitors system performance and suggests modifications.
5. **Code Modifier**: Responsible for safely altering code to evolve system capabilities.

```python
# self_evolving_autonomy/__init__.py

class AutonomyStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.environment = EnvironmentInterface()
        self.evol_engine = EvolutionaryEngine()
        self.learning_agents = [LearningAgent()]
        self.monitor = PerformanceMonitor()
        self.code_modifier = CodeModifier()

    def run(self):
        while True:
            for agent in self.learning_agents:
                feedback = self.environment.collect_feedback(agent)
                agent.learn(feedback)
                self.evol_engine.evolve(agent)
                self.monitor.monitor_performance(agent)
                if self.monitor.needs_modification(agent):
                    self.code_modifier.modify(agent)

class EnvironmentInterface:
    def collect_feedback(self, agent):
        # Logic to interact with the environment and collect feedback
        pass

class EvolutionaryEngine:
    def evolve(self, agent):
        # Logic to perform recursive evolution using genetic algorithms
        pass

class LearningAgent:
    def learn(self, feedback):
        # Recursive learning strategy implementation
        pass

class PerformanceMonitor:
    def monitor_performance(self, agent):
        # Logic to monitor agent performance
        pass

    def needs_modification(self, agent):
        # Decide if code modification is needed
        pass

class CodeModifier:
    def modify(self, agent):
        # Logic to safely modify the code
        pass

# Usage example
autonomy_stack = AutonomyStack()
autonomy_stack.run()
```

### Recursive Strategies:

1. **Recursive Learning**: Within `LearningAgent`, recursive strategies like reinforcement learning can help agents adapt by trial and error. Recursive neural networks (RNNs) can be employed for sequence prediction and context learning.
   
2. **Genetic Algorithms**: The `EvolutionaryEngine` can implement a genetic algorithm where agents are evolved over many generations, selecting for the most successful behaviors and characteristics.

3. **Self-Modification**: Within `CodeModifier`, design functions to safely and recursively modify parts of agent code that are underperforming or can be optimized. This can involve AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) manipulation or other dynamic code modification techniques available in Python.

### Considerations:

- **Safety**: Ensure modifications do not introduce vulnerabilities or break system functionality.
- **Performance**: Monitor the performance impact of recursive strategies to ensure overall efficiency.
- **Testing**: Implement thorough testing whenever code is modified to ensure changes do not introduce bugs.

By focusing on these recursive strategies, your module can expand the PTM empire’s capability of evolving autonomously in a self-improving cycle.
