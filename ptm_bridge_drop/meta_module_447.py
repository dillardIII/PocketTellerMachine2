Designing a new Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumed Task Management) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a recursive, adaptable system that enhances autonomy over time. Below is a conceptual outline for such a module, focusing on recursive strategies and innovative concepts:

### Module Overview: `ptm_auto_evolution`

The `ptm_auto_evolution` module is designed to implement recursive strategies that allow an autonomous system to learn, adapt, and optimize itself over time without explicit external inputs. The module incorporates neural network-based learning, evolutionary algorithms, and a recursive improvement framework.

#### Key Components

1. **Recursive Learning Framework (RLF):**
   - **Purpose:** Continuously refines its own algorithms based on performance feedback.
   - **Components:**
     - **Self-Evaluation:** Routine checks using predefined and self-defined metrics to assess performance.
     - **Recursive Optimization:** Use feedback to adjust hyperparameters and algorithmic structures recursively.

2. **Evolutionary Strategy Engine (ESE):**
   - **Purpose:** Implements genetic algorithms to evolve solutions.
   - **Components:**
     - **Mutation Operators:** Explore variations in control strategies.
     - **Crossover Mechanisms:** Combine successful strategies to refine solutions.
     - **Selection Processes:** Prioritize strategies that yield better performance.

3. **Neural Controller Module (NCM):**
   - **Purpose:** Uses neural networks to adapt decision-making processes.
   - **Components:**
     - **Adaptive Neural Networks:** Periodically adjust neural network weights based on new data inputs.
     - **Reinforcement Learning Layer:** Implement techniques like Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks for real-time adaptation.

4. **Data Feedback Loop (DFL):**
   - **Purpose:** Integrates real-world data into the learning mechanisms.
   - **Components:**
     - **Data Collection:** Continuously acquire data from sensors and user inputs.
     - **Feedback Processing:** Use this data to refine RLF, ESE, and NCM components.

5. **Autonomous Decision Core (ADC):**
   - **Purpose:** Central hub for decision-making, integrating insights from all the components.
   - **Components:**
     - **Dynamic Task Management:** Assigns tasks based on calculated priorities and system capabilities.
     - **Predictive Analysis:** Forecasts future tasks and needs based on historical trends.

#### Key Innovative Features

1. **Recursive Task Refinement:**
   - Implement a priority queue that uses recursive algorithms to refine tasks based on urgency and importance, allowing for self-improvement in task handling efficiency.

2. **Auto-Catalytic Networks:**
   - Networks that leverage self-referential processing, enhancing the neural layers’ capabilities by recursively integrating past decision data.

3. **Adaptive Genetic Pool:**
   - Dynamically adjusts the size and diversity of the strategy pool based on current performance and environmental complexity, leading to more adaptable and robust evolutionary strategies.

4. **Dynamic Environment Simulation:**
   - A simulated environment that evolves along with the system, providing a continuously challenging platform for testing new strategies.

#### Sample Python Code Skeleton

```python
class RecursiveLearningFramework:
    def self_evaluate(self):
        # Implement self-assessment logic
        pass

    def recursive_optimize(self):
        # Optimize algorithms based on evaluation
        pass

class EvolutionaryStrategyEngine:
    def mutate(self):
        # Genetic mutation logic
        pass

    def crossover(self):
        # Genetic crossover logic
        pass

    def select(self):
        # Selection logic for best strategies
        pass

class NeuralControllerModule:
    def adaptive_learning(self, input_data):
        # Adaptive learning using neural networks
        pass

    def reinforcement_learning(self):
        # Implement reinforcement learning logic
        pass

class AutonomousDecisionCore:
    def manage_tasks(self):
        # Dynamic task management
        pass

    def predictive_analysis(self):
        # Predictive analysis for future planning
        pass

# Initialize modules and integrate components
rlf = RecursiveLearningFramework()
ese = EvolutionaryStrategyEngine()
ncm = NeuralControllerModule()
adc = AutonomousDecisionCore()
```

This module can be further expanded by integrating more specific algorithms and strategies tailored to the PTM empire’s requirements. It is designed to be scalable and adaptable, allowing for enhanced autonomy over time.
