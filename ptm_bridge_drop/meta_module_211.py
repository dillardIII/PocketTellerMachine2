Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical company) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a forward-thinking approach, focusing on cutting-edge AI and machine learning techniques. Here's a conceptual outline for such a module, highlighting innovative recursive strategies and self-evolution features. The objective is to provide an architecture that adapts and evolves autonomously as it learns from new data and experiences.

### Module: PTM-AutoEvolver

#### Key Components

1. **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**
   - **StreamCollector:** Continuously gather data from diverse sources (e.g., sensors, logs, user interactions).
   - **AutoCleaner:** Automatically detects and corrects inconsistencies or anomalies in real-time.

2. **Self-Evolving Learning Core**
   - **MetaLearner:** Employs meta-learning techniques to adapt learning strategies based on the task and environment.
     - Implements Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for fast adaptation.
   - **Recursive Adaptive Networks (RANs):** Recursively update network architecture based on performance metrics.
     - Utilizes Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find optimal architectures dynamically.

3. **Autonomous Decision Making**
   - **Contextual Bandit System:** Makes real-time decisions based on context, minimizing long-term regret.
   - **Action-Skill Mapper:** Maps high-level decisions to fine-grained actions using hierarchical reinforcement learning.

4. **Knowledge Retention and Evolution**
   - **MemoryStack:** Long-term and short-term memory components enable knowledge accumulation and recall.
   - **KnowledgeGraph:** Structurally encodes learned knowledge, assisting in making connections and inferences.

5. **Continuous Evaluation and Feedback**
   - **PerformanceMetrics Engine:** Constantly evaluates model performance using user-defined and system-suggested metrics.
   - **FeedbackLooper:** Integrates user feedback and downstream tasks into the learning process, ensuring alignment with goals.

6. **Security and Safety**
   - **RiskAnalyzer:** Predicts and mitigates risks in autonomous operations by analyzing historical and simulation data.
   - **EthicalAI Module:** Ensures decisions adhere to ethical guidelines and compliance standards.

### Innovative Recursive Strategies

1. **Recursive Learning Loops**
   - Implement self-feedback mechanisms where the output of a learning cycle forms the input for the next iteration, refining model accuracy.

2. **Self-Optimizing Hyperparameters**
   - ANNs leverage genetic algorithms to recursively adjust hyperparameters, optimizing for performance without manual intervention.

3. **Dynamic Environment Simulation**
   - The module can simulate various environments to prepare models for real-world unpredictability, recursively updating the complexity of simulations based on learned outcomes.
