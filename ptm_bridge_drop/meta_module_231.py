Creating a Python module to contribute to the PTM (Presumably Technologically-Minded) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves designing a system that leverages machine learning, recursive strategies, and possibly some form of meta-learning or continuous learning framework. Below is an outline and a basic implementation to illustrate how you might design such a module.

### Design Concepts

1. **Recursive Learning Strategy**: Employ a recursive, hierarchical approach to learning where models serve as input to subsequent models, refining the model accuracy and adaptability.

2. **Meta-Learning**: Implement techniques that enable the system to learn new tasks quickly using knowledge from previously learned tasks.

3. **Continuous Data Acquisition**: Integrate a method to continually feed new data into the models, enabling continuous learning and model updating.

4. **Self-Evaluation and Improvement**: Include mechanisms for the system to monitor its performance and make adjustments to its strategy over time.

5. **Hybrid Learning Models**: Combine different types of models (e.g., neural networks, decision trees) to exploit the strengths of various algorithms.

### Python Module Structure

The module could be structured as follows:

```python
# ptm_autonomy.py
import numpy as np
import random
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.utils.validation import check_X_y, check_array, check_is_fitted


class RecursiveLearningModel(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
    """
    A recursive learning model that uses a hierarchy of machine learning models
    to perform self-improving predictions.
    """

    def __init__(self, base_estimators=None, recursive_depth=3, random_state=None):
        self.base_estimators = base_estimators if base_estimators else [RandomForestClassifier(), MLPClassifier()]
        self.recursive_depth = recursive_depth
        self.random_state = random_state

    def fit(self, X, y):
        X, y = check_X_y(X, y)
        self.models_ = [random.choice(self.base_estimators) for _ in range(self.recursive_depth)]
        for model in self.models_:
            model.fit(X, y)
            predictions = model.predict(X)
            X = np.c_[X, predictions]  # Append predictions as new features
        return self

    def predict(self, X):
        check_is_fitted(self)
        X = check_array(X)
        for model in self.models_:
            predictions = model.predict(X)
            X = np.c_[X, predictions]
        return predictions

    def evaluate_and_improve(self, X, y, eval_metric=None):
        """
        Evaluate the current model performance and adaptively improve the model architecture.
        
        Args:
            X: Input features.
            y: True labels.
            eval_metric: Evaluation metric function. Defaults to accuracy if None.

        Returns:
            Evaluation results.
        """
        eval_metric = eval_metric if eval_metric else lambda y_true, y_pred: np.mean(y_true == y_pred)
        current_score = eval_metric(y, self.predict(X))
        print(f"Current Evaluation Score: {current_score}")
        # Example heuristic improvement strategy
        if current_score < 0.8:
            self.recursive_depth += 1
            self.fit(X, y)
            print("Model adapted for better performance.")
        return current_score

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    model = RecursiveLearningModel()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    print("Initial Score:", model.evaluate_and_improve(X_test, y_test))
```

### Key Features

- **Recursive Learning**: The `RecursiveLearningModel.fit()` method updates the features with predictions made by models in the hierarchy, building complexity across learning cycles.
- **Self-Evaluation & Improvement**: The `evaluate_and_improve()` method assesses the model's performance and adjusts its complexity if necessary.
- **Modular Methods**: The module is designed to easily integrate different base models and evaluation metrics.

This design provides a flexible starting point for building a powerful self-evolving autonomy stack suited to various machine learning problems, capable of improving through recursive iterations and adaptability.
