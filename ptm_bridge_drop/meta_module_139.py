To design a new Python module that expands the PTM (Presumably a technology or concept within a hypothetical empire) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack, we need to consider several key components that enable recursive strategies and self-improvement. This will include machine learning, decision-making processes, autonomous updating, and monitoring mechanisms. Below is a conceptual outline and some code snippets for such a module, which I will call `recursive_autonomy`.

### Module Overview

The `recursive_autonomy` module will focus on:
1. **Self-Optimization**: Continuously improving its own algorithms and workflows.
2. **Recursive Strategy Implementation**: Utilizing recursive methods to solve problems and improve autonomously.
3. **Autonomous Learning and Adaptation**: Leveraging machine learning techniques to adapt and evolve based on new data.
4. **Monitoring and Feedback Loops**: Implementing feedback loops to ensure the system remains efficient and effective.

### Code Snippets

#### 1. Environment Setup

First, we need to set up a simulated environment for testing and adapting strategies.

```python
import numpy as np

class Environment:
    def __init__(self, state_size):
        self.state = np.random.rand(state_size)
        self.reward = 0

    def reset(self):
        self.state = np.random.rand(len(self.state))
        self.reward = 0
        return self.state

    def step(self, action):
        # Execute action and update state and reward
        self.state = self.state + action
        self.reward = np.sum(self.state)  # Simplified reward function
        return self.state, self.reward
```

#### 2. Recursive Strategy

Implement a recursive function that optimizes itself based on feedback.

```python
class RecursiveOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, initial_strategy):
        self.strategy = initial_strategy
    
    def recursive_optimize(self, env, iterations=10):
        state = env.reset()
        for _ in range(iterations):
            action = self._generate_action(state)
            state, reward = env.step(action)
            self.strategy = self._update_strategy(state, reward)
        
    def _generate_action(self, state):
        # Generate action based on the current strategy
        return state * self.strategy
    
    def _update_strategy(self, state, reward):
        # Recursive strategy update
        new_strategy = self.strategy + reward * 0.01  # Simplified
        return new_strategy

env = Environment(state_size=5)
optimizer = RecursiveOptimizer(initial_strategy=0.1)
optimizer.recursive_optimize(env)
```

#### 3. Autonomous Learning

Integrate machine learning for adaptive improvements.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

class AutonomousLearner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = LinearRegression()
    
    def train(self, X, y):
        self.model.fit(X, y)
    
    def predict(self, X):
        return self.model.predict(X)

    def self_train(self, env):
        states, rewards = [], []
        for _ in range(100):  # Collect data
            state = env.reset()
            for _ in range(10):
                action = np.random.rand(len(state))
                state, reward = env.step(action)
                states.append(state)
                rewards.append(reward)
        self.train(np.array(states), np.array(rewards))
```

#### 4. Monitoring and Feedback Loops

Implement monitoring to adjust strategies based on performance.

```python
class Monitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []

    def log(self, info):
        self.history.append(info)

    def analyze_performance(self):
        if len(self.history) > 0:
            avg_reward = np.mean([h['reward'] for h in self.history])
            return avg_reward
        return None

    def feedback_loop(self, optimizer, env):
        avg_reward = self.analyze_performance()
        if avg_reward is not None and avg_reward < threshold:
            optimizer.recursive_optimize(env)

threshold = 50
monitor = Monitor()
env = Environment(5)
optimizer = RecursiveOptimizer(0.1)
monitor.feedback_loop(optimizer, env)
```

### Conclusion

This module integrates recursive optimization of strategies, autonomous learning, and a feedback monitoring loop. These components work together to create a self-evolving system capable of adapting to changes in the environment, continuously improving performance. By using recursive strategies and machine learning, this module can potentially form the backbone of an innovative autonomy stack for the PTM empire.
