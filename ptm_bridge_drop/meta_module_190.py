Designing a new Python module for enhancing the PTM (Presumably a fictional empire concept) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating innovative recursive strategies to ensure robustness, scalability, and adaptability. Hereâ€™s a conceptual framework for such a module:

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy_expander`

#### Overview:
The `ptm_autonomy_expander` module focuses on recursive learning, dynamic system adjustments, and real-time decision-making to elevate the autonomy stack of the PTM empire. It implements recursive strategies, AI-driven models, and adaptive feedback loops.

#### Key Features:
- **Recursive Learning Algorithms:** Self-improving algorithms that iterate over multiple generations to optimize performance.
- **Dynamic Environment Adaption:** Real-time adaptation to changing environments using AI-driven simulations.
- **Feedback Loop Mechanisms:** Continuous feedback systems to refine decision-making processes.
- **Distributed Intelligence System:** Distributes processing across networked nodes to enhance decision-making capability.
- **Self-diagnostic and Repair System:** Autonomous system checks and repairs to ensure longevity and reliability.

#### Architecture Components:
1. **Core Module:**
   - Initializes key components and manages overall runtime operations.
   
2. **Recursive Learning Engine:**
   - Implements machine learning algorithms that use past performance data to predict and improve future actions. Key techniques include:
     - Evolutionary Strategies
     - Neural Networks with backpropagation
     - Reinforcement Learning
 
3. **Dynamic Adaption Layer:**
   - Observes real-time environmental data and applies advanced analytic strategies to adapt system parameters dynamically.

4. **Feedback Controller:**
   - Builds on control theory principles to maintain desired states and optimize system performance using both positive and negative feedback loops.

5. **Distributed Intelligence Coordinator:**
   - Manages distributed systems and ensures efficient resource utilization and task allocation using edge computing principles.

6. **Self-Maintenance System:**
   - Periodically checks system health and executes preventive and corrective maintenance routines using anomaly detection algorithms.

#### Implementation Plan:

```python
# ptm_autonomy_expander.py

class RecursiveLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def evolutionary_strategy(self):
        # Implement recursive evolutionary strategy logic
        pass

    def neural_network_backprop(self, training_data):
        # Implement backpropagation logic
        pass

    def reinforcement_learning(self, environment):
        # Reinforcement learning logic to adapt to environments
        pass

class DynamicAdaptionLayer:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def adapt_parameters(self, environmental_data):
        # Real-time parameter adaptation based on environment observations
        pass

class FeedbackController:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def optimize_system_state(self):
        # Implement feedback loop control strategy
        pass

class DistributedIntelligenceCoordinator:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def distribute_processing(self, tasks):
        # Logic for distributing tasks across networked nodes
        pass

class SelfMaintenanceSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def perform_system_checks(self):
        # Perform autonomous system diagnostics
        pass
    
    def execute_repairs(self):
        # Perform automatic repairs
        pass

class PTMAutonomyExpander:
    def __init__(self):
        self.learning_engine = RecursiveLearningEngine()
        self.adaption_layer = DynamicAdaptionLayer()
        self.feedback_controller = FeedbackController()
        self.intelligence_coordinator = DistributedIntelligenceCoordinator()
        self.maintenance_system = SelfMaintenanceSystem()

    def run(self):
        # Main loop to integrate all subsystems
        while True:
            # Example integration of different subsystems
            self.learning_engine.evolutionary_strategy()
            self.adaption_layer.adapt_parameters({"temp": 25})
            self.feedback_controller.optimize_system_state()
            self.intelligence_coordinator.distribute_processing(["task1", "task2"])
            self.maintenance_system.perform_system_checks()
            # Add time for each loop iteration
            time.sleep(1)

# Execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    autonomy_expander = PTMAutonomyExpander()
    autonomy_expander.run()
```

#### Strategic Advantage:
The `ptm_autonomy_expander` enhances autonomy and decision-making in uncertain environments, pushing the PTM empire towards self-sufficiency, reduced system overhead, and increased resilience against external challenges.

#### Innovations:
- Introduces recursive strategies that allow systems to 'learn how to learn.'
- Embodies a modular approach, allowing targeted enhancements of subsystem capabilities.
- Fully autonomous self-repair system reduces the requirement for human intervention.

This conceptual framework provides a robust starting point for developing an advanced autonomy stack, embedding state-of-the-art AI strategies and self-evolving capabilities.
