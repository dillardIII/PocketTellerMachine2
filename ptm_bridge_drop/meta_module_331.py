Creating a Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical empire or organization) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves several key considerations. The module should incorporate autonomy, recursion, learning algorithms, and be scalable and adaptable for undefined future needs. Below is a conceptual design and a basic implementation:

### Key components:

1. **Recursive Learning Algorithms**: Enable the system to learn and adapt from its own outputs.
2. **Hybrid Architecture**: Combining rule-based systems with machine learning models.
3. **Scalable Framework**: Ensure the system can evolve without architectural changes.
4. **Feedback Mechanism**: Continually adapt based on results.
5. **Modular Design**: Allow easy integration with other systems and future innovations.

### Python Module: AutonomousPTM

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import random
import logging
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Define a base class for an autonomous agent with recursive capabilities
class AutonomousAgent(ABC):
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_base = []
    
    @abstractmethod
    def perceive(self, environment):
        """Method to perceive the environment and update knowledge base."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def decide(self):
        """Method to make decisions based on the knowledge base."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def act(self):
        """Method to perform actions in the environment."""
        pass

    def recursive_learn(self):
        """Method to learn recursively from previous actions and decisions."""
        logging.debug(f'Starting recursive learning. Knowledge Base size: {len(self.knowledge_base)}')
        
        if len(self.knowledge_base) >= 5:  # for demonstration, assuming if we have 5 or more knowledge, we re-evaluate
            # Simple recursive adjustment algorithm (Placeholder for complex logic)
            self.knowledge_base = self.knowledge_base[-5:]  # Keep the latest insights
            logging.debug('Recursive learning adjusted the knowledge base.')

    def update_knowledge_base(self, info):
        """Updates the knowledge base with new information."""
        logging.debug(f'Updating knowledge base with info: {info}')
        self.knowledge_base.append(info)
        self.recursive_learn()


# A sample implementation of an autonomous agent: ExampleAgent
class ExampleAgent(AutonomousAgent):
    def perceive(self, environment):
        # Update the knowledge base based on perceived environment
        perception = random.choice(environment)
        logging.debug(f'Agent perceived: {perception}')
        self.update_knowledge_base(perception)

    def decide(self):
        # Make decisions based on the current knowledge base
        if self.knowledge_base:
            decision = self.knowledge_base[-1]  # Simple decision based on latest knowledge
            logging.debug(f'Decision made: {decision}')
            return decision
        logging.debug('No decision made.')
        return None

    def act(self):
        # Perform an action based on the decision
        decision = self.decide()
        if decision:
            logging.debug(f'Acting on decision with action: {decision}')
            # Placeholder for complex action logic
        else:
            logging.debug('No action taken due to lack of decision.')

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_env = ['Perception1', 'Perception2', 'Perception3']
    agent = ExampleAgent()

    # Autonomous operation loop
    for _ in range(10):
        agent.perceive(example_env)
        agent.act()

    logging.debug('Autonomy process completed.')
```

### Features and Concepts Explained:

1. **Abstract Base Class**: `AutonomousAgent` serves as a blueprint for all autonomous agents in the PTM stack. It emphasizes recursive learning.
  
2. **Recursive Learning**: This module includes a simple base for recursive learning by refining its knowledge base and adjusting its decision-making process accordingly.

3. **Decision and Action**: `ExampleAgent` perceives its environment, updates its knowledge, makes decisions, and acts, allowing a foundation for autonomous operations.

4. **Scalability**: The modular design allows future agents to be created with expanded features and learning techniques without disrupting existing infrastructure.

5. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging is implemented for debugging and tracking the agent's development process.

### Future Enhancements:

- **Advanced Learning**: Incorporate deep learning, genetic algorithms, or reinforcement learning for more robust decision-making.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Enable collaboration and communication among multiple agents.
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Enhance feedback loops for real-time environment adaptation. 

This is a simplified model serving as a foundation that can be expanded with more complex algorithms and infrastructures to meet specific needs of the PTM empire's autonomy stack.
