Creating a Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical organization or concept) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves implementing key features such as recursive strategies, self-improvement capabilities, and adaptability. Below is a conceptual design and code implementation for such a module.

### Conceptual Design

1. **Self-Monitoring & Analysis**: Implement functionality to monitor system performance and identify areas for improvement.
   
2. **Recursive Learning**: Use recursive functions to iterate over tasks, refine them, and update the system based on feedback.

3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Allow the system to adapt its strategy based on the environment and the data it receives.

4. **Feedback Loop**: Implement continuous feedback loops for adjusting parameters and strategies.

### Module Implementation

```python
import logging
import random

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

class SelfEvolvingAutonomy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategy_params = {
            'learning_rate': 0.1,
            'adaptation_threshold': 0.05
        }
        logging.info("Initialized self-evolving autonomy module with default parameters.")

    def monitor_performance(self):
        # Dummy performance metric
        performance_score = random.uniform(0, 1)
        logging.info(f"Current performance score: {performance_score:.2f}")
        return performance_score

    def recursive_learning(self, task, depth=0, max_depth=5):
        """Recursive function to improve tasks."""
        logging.info(f"Executing task at depth {depth}: {task}")
        
        performance_score = self.monitor_performance()
        
        if depth < max_depth:
            # Simulate task improvement based on performance score
            if performance_score < self.strategy_params['adaptation_threshold']:
                logging.info(f"Performance below threshold, refining task: {task}")
                new_task = self.adapt_strategy(task)
                self.recursive_learning(new_task, depth + 1, max_depth)

    def adapt_strategy(self, task):
        """Adapt strategy based on current task performance."""
        improved_task = task + "_refined"
        logging.info(f"Adapting strategy for task: {task} -> {improved_task}")
        
        self.strategy_params['learning_rate'] *= 0.9  # Simulate adapting learning rate
        logging.info(f"Updated strategy parameters: {self.strategy_params}")

        return improved_task

    def evolve(self):
        """Main evolutionary loop."""
        initial_task = "baseline_task"
        self.recursive_learning(initial_task)
        logging.info("Self-evolution cycle complete.")

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    autonomy_module = SelfEvolvingAutonomy()
    autonomy_module.evolve()
```

### Key Features

- **Logging**: Provides detailed information about the performance and strategy adaptation process.
  
- **RecursiveLearning**: Introduces recursive refining of tasks based on performance analysis.
  
- **AdaptStrategy**: Continuously adjusts strategy parameters to improve task execution.

### Future Enhancements

- **Integration with Machine Learning**: Incorporate ML models to predict changes in efficiency and make more advanced adaptations.

- **Data Input from Real Environment**: Integrate data from sensors or databases for real-world applications.

- **Enhanced Decision Making**: Use reinforcement learning for complex decision-making processes.

This module serves as a base framework to expand upon, with flexibility to incorporate more sophisticated strategies as new technologies and methodologies evolve.
