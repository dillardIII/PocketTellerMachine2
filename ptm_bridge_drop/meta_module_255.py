Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Potentially Theoretical Model) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a framework that allows for continuous learning and adaptation. The module should focus on recursive strategies that enable the system to optimize itself through iterative feedback loops. Below is a high-level design outline and a sample implementation concept:

### Design Outline

1. **Core Components**:
   - **Data Ingestion**: Module for continuously gathering data from various sources.
   - **Self-Evolution Engine**: Core component responsible for iterative self-improvement processes.
   - **Evaluation Metrics**: System to evaluate performance and guide recursive learning.
   - **Knowledge Repository**: Centralized store to maintain learned experiences and outcomes.
   - **Adaptive Logic Layer**: Mechanism to alter behavior based on new insights.

2. **Recursive Strategies**:
   - **Layered Feedback Loops**: Implement feedback loops at multiple layers for micro and macro adjustments.
   - **Meta-Learning**: Develop algorithms that learn how to learn, adapting to changing environments.
   - **Simulation & Testing**: Use virtual environments to test hypotheses and strategies safely.
   - **Continuous Deployment**: Seamless integration of improvements into the live system after testing.

3. **Integration with PTM**:
   - Ensure that the module interfaces smoothly with existing PTM components.
   - Use APIs for communication between new and existing modules.

### Sample Implementation Concept

```python
import random
import logging

# Initialize logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class KnowledgeRepository:
    """Centralized store for experiences and outcomes."""
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_base = []

    def store(self, data):
        logging.info(f"Storing data: {data}")
        self.knowledge_base.append(data)

    def retrieve(self):
        logging.info("Retrieving data from knowledge base.")
        return self.knowledge_base

class SelfEvolutionEngine:
    """Engine for driving self-evolving processes."""
    def __init__(self, knowledge_repo):
        self.knowledge_repo = knowledge_repo
        
    def evaluate(self, results):
        performance = sum(results) / len(results) if results else 0
        logging.info(f"Evaluating performance: {performance}")
        return performance

    def evolve(self, strategy_func):
        results = [strategy_func() for _ in range(10)]
        performance = self.evaluate(results)
        self.knowledge_repo.store({'strategy': strategy_func.__name__, 'results': results, 'performance': performance})
        return performance

class AdaptiveSystem:
    """Adaptive system based on recursive strategies."""
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_repo = KnowledgeRepository()
        self.evolution_engine = SelfEvolutionEngine(self.knowledge_repo)
        self.strategies = [self.strategy_one, self.strategy_two, self.strategy_three]
    
    def strategy_one(self):
        result = random.choice([0, 1])
        logging.info(f"Strategy One Result: {result}")
        return result
    
    def strategy_two(self):
        result = random.choice([0, 1, 1])
        logging.info(f"Strategy Two Result: {result}")
        return result
    
    def strategy_three(self):
        result = random.choice([1, 1, 1, 0])
        logging.info(f"Strategy Three Result: {result}")
        return result
    
    def run(self):
        logging.info("Starting adaptive system...")
        current_performance = 0
        iteration = 0
        while True:
            logging.info(f"Iteration: {iteration}")
            for strategy in self.strategies:
                performance = self.evolution_engine.evolve(strategy)
                if performance > current_performance:
                    logging.info(f"New optimal strategy found: {strategy.__name__} with performance {performance}")
                    current_performance = performance
            iteration += 1
            if iteration > 100:  # Safeguard to prevent infinite loop
                logging.info("Completed 100 iterations. Stopping.")
                break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    system = AdaptiveSystem()
    system.run()
```

### Key Aspects Explained

- **Knowledge Repository** stores and retrieves experiences, acting as the brain of the system.
- **Self-Evolution Engine** evaluates strategies and stores results, guiding the adaptation process.
- **Strategies** are simplified simulations of how the module can optimize its behavior.
- **Adaptive System** encapsulates the entire process, running different strategies and choosing the optimal one based on performance.

This design is abstract and needs to align with your specific PTM objectives and constraints. You may also use advanced data structures and machine learning models to enhance the module's capabilities and efficiency.
