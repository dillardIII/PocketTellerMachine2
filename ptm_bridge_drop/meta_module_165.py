Designing a Python module to enhance an autonomy stack for a self-evolving system, such as the PTM empire, involves several components and innovative strategies. Below is a high-level design and outline for such a module, focusing on recursive strategies that improve the systemâ€™s efficiency, adaptability, and learning capabilities.

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy_evolver`

#### Key Features

1. **Recursive Learning**: Implement recursive learning techniques that enable the system to continually learn from new data and improve its performance over time without explicit programming for each new scenario.

2. **Self-Optimization**: Integrate algorithms that allow the system to optimize its own processes and parameters by recursively evaluating past actions and outcomes.

3. **Dynamic Environment Adaptation**: Utilize recursive strategies to adapt to changes in the environment automatically, ensuring that the autonomy stack remains effective in diverse conditions.

4. **Hierarchical Decision Making**: Recursive approaches can be used to build a hierarchical decision-making system that enhances strategic and tactical planning capabilities.

5. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Employ techniques that can handle and optimize several objectives simultaneously using recursive evaluation methods.

6. **Self-Diagnostic Tools**: Develop tools that recursively check the system's health and performance metrics, allowing it to self-repair and maintain high reliability.

#### Module Structure

```python
# ptm_autonomy_evolver/

# core.py
# ---------------------------------------------------
class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, initial_data):
        self.data = initial_data
        self.model = self.initialize_model()

    def initialize_model(self):
        # Initialize the base model
        pass

    def train(self):
        # Recursively train the model with new data
        pass

    def update(self, new_data):
        # Integrate new data recursively
        self.data.extend(new_data)
        self.train()

# optimizer.py
# ---------------------------------------------------
class SelfOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.parameters = self.initialize_parameters()

    def initialize_parameters(self):
        # Set up initial parameters
        pass

    def optimize(self):
        # Recursively optimize parameters
        pass

# adaptation.py
# ---------------------------------------------------
class EnvironmentAdapter:
    def monitor_changes(self, environment_data):
        # Monitor and detect changes in environment
        pass

    def adapt(self):
        # Recursively adapt to changes
        pass

# decision_maker.py
# ---------------------------------------------------
class HierarchicalDecisionMaker:
    def make_decision(self, data):
        # Use recursive methods to make decisions
        pass

    def evaluate_outcomes(self):
        # Recursively evaluate past decisions
        pass

# diagnostic.py
# ---------------------------------------------------
class SelfDiagnostic:
    def run_diagnostics(self):
        # Recursively check system health
        pass

    def repair(self):
        # Self-repair mechanisms
        pass

# Example of usage in main.py
# ---------------------------------------------------
from ptm_autonomy_evolver.core import RecursiveLearner
from ptm_autonomy_evolver.optimizer import SelfOptimizer
from ptm_autonomy_evolver.adaptation import EnvironmentAdapter
from ptm_autonomy_evolver.decision_maker import HierarchicalDecisionMaker
from ptm_autonomy_evolver.diagnostic import SelfDiagnostic

def main():
    learner = RecursiveLearner(initial_data=[])
    optimizer = SelfOptimizer()
    adapter = EnvironmentAdapter()
    decision_maker = HierarchicalDecisionMaker()
    diagnostic_tool = SelfDiagnostic()

    # Example workflow
    decision_maker.make_decision(learner.data)
    optimizer.optimize()
    adapter.adapt()
    diagnostic_tool.run_diagnostics()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Innovative Recursive Strategies

- **Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Utilize RNNs for processing sequences of data and making improved predictions based on past information.

- **Self-Adjusting Feedback Loops**: Implement feedback mechanisms that continuously refine the decision-making processes based on the outcomes observed.

- **Adaptive Heuristic Algorithms**: Deploy heuristic approaches that adjust over time, based on recursive learning from new patterns and scenarios.

This module design serves as a foundational structure to expand upon, incorporating more domain-specific features and advanced techniques suited to the particular needs of the PTM empire's autonomous systems. Each component is designed to interact with others, forming a robust system capable of self-evolution and continuous improvement.
