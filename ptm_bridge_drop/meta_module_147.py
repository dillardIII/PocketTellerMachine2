Developing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical empire related to a technological entity) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a blend of advanced software engineering, AI, and systems design. This module would need to introduce innovative recursive strategies to enable adaptability, self-improvement, and scalability. Let's sketch an outline and concepts for such a module.

### Module: `ptm_autonomy_stack`

#### Key Components:
1. **Recursive Learning Engine**: A core component that implements algorithms for recursive improvement and learning.

2. **Self-Optimization Framework**: Continuously analyzes performance metrics and optimizes processes.

3. **Adaptive System Management**: Dynamically adjusts system configurations based on environmental and internal data.

4. **Robust Decision-Making Algorithm**: Uses probabilistic models to make decisions under uncertainty.

5. **Swarm Intelligence Simulator**: Implements collective behavior strategies derived from natural systems.

6. **Resource Allocation Manager**: Efficiently distributes resources across multiple tasks and priorities.

7. **Predictive Analytics Module**: Uses machine learning to predict future states of the system environment.

8. **Feedback Control Systems**: Essential for maintaining desired system behaviors under varying conditions.

#### Recursive Strategies:

##### Recursive Learning Engine
- **Implementation Concept**:
  - Use deep reinforcement learning algorithms like Deep Q-Learning.
  - Integrate recursive self-improvement: After learning, models are periodically distilled into simpler, more efficient models without losing performance.

```python
class RecursiveLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize neural network architectures, optimizers, etc.
        self.model = self.build_model()
        
    def build_model(self):
        # Construct neural networks using frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch
        pass
        
    def train(self, environment):
        # Implement training loop using Q-Learning or other RL techniques
        pass

    def recursive_improvement(self):
        # Implement model distillation and simplification
        pass
```

##### Self-Optimization Framework
- **Implementation Concept**:
  - Continuously monitor performance metrics.
  - Employ genetic algorithms to evolve process configurations.
  - Use feedback loops to refine strategies.

```python
class SelfOptimizationFramework:
    def __init__(self, initial_config):
        self.current_config = initial_config

    def monitor_performance(self):
        # Gather data on current system performance
        pass

    def optimize(self):
        # Use genetic algorithms to explore new configurations
        pass

    def feedback_loop(self, performance_data):
        # Adjust configurations based on feedback
        pass
```

##### Adaptive System Management
- **Implementation Concept**:
  - Use rule-based systems and machine learning to adapt configurations.
  - Implement hot-swapping of components for seamless updates.

```python
class AdaptiveSystemManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.configurations = self.load_initial_settings()

    def dynamic_adjustment(self, input_data):
        # Adjust system parameters dynamically based on input
        pass

    def hot_swap_component(self, component):
        # Replace system components efficiently
        pass
```

#### Integration Strategies:
- Establish communication protocols between modules using message-passing or a publish-subscribe model.
- Implement a central orchestrator to manage inter-module interactions and data-sharing.
  
#### Testing and Evaluation:
- Set up robust testing environments using simulation.
- Incorporate A/B testing to evaluate performance enhancements.
- Use a modular architecture to test components independently.

#### Scalability and Resiliency:
- Design the module to be scalable to accommodate various domains and workloads.
- Implement fault tolerance and recovery strategies to handle unexpected failures.

This blueprint outlines how innovative recursive strategies can be employed to expand a self-evolving autonomy stack. Extending this framework would involve further detailing and implementing these components, using cutting-edge technologies in AI and software engineering.
