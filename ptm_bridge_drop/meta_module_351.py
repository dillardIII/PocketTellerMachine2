Designing a Python module for PTM (Presumably a conceptual entity for this task) that focuses on expanding its self-evolving autonomy stack using innovative recursive strategies requires a clear understanding of the system's objectives, architecture, and the domain it's applied to. Here's a broad outline and design suggestion for such a module:

### Module: `self_evolver.py`

#### Overview
This module will incorporate recursive self-improvement strategies, leveraging machine learning and AI concepts to adapt and enhance the autonomy stack of the PTM empire. The primary objective is to facilitate continuous learning and adaptation to dynamic environments or tasks.

#### Key Components

1. **Recursive Strategy Manager**
   - Manages recursive strategies for self-improvement.
   - Dynamically updates its strategies based on feedback.

2. **Learning Engine**
   - Utilizes machine learning models to adapt behavior based on data input.
   - Supports reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks for continuous learning and decision making.

3. **Environment Simulator**
   - Simulates scenarios for testing and evaluation.
   - Provides feedback loops for recursive learning processes.

4. **Metrics Analyzer**
   - Analyzes performance metrics to guide the evolution strategy.
   - Uses data analytics to fine-tune autonomy parameters.

5. **Data Repository**
   - Stores historical data for training and evaluation.
   - Implements a version control mechanism for iterative improvement.

#### Recursive Strategies

- **Recursive Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**
  - Utilizes NAS techniques to automatically evolve neural network structures.
  - Allows the system to explore and converge on optimal architectures over time.

- **Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning**
  - Employs strategies like Bayesian Optimization or Genetic Algorithms to optimize hyperparameters.
  - Continuously updates hyperparameters based on evolving objectives and constraints.

- **Feedback-Driven Model Selection**
  - Implements a feedback loop to select the most effective models based on performance metrics.
  - Employs techniques like ensemble learning for robustness.

#### Implementation

Here's a skeletal implementation of the `self_evolver.py` module, focusing on structure without delving into specific algorithms:

```python
import numpy as np

class RecursiveStrategyManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategies = []
        
    def add_strategy(self, strategy):
        self.strategies.append(strategy)
        
    def evolve(self, feedback):
        # Evaluate and select strategies based on feedback
        for strategy in self.strategies:
            strategy.adapt(feedback)

class LearningEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = None  # Placeholder for ML model
        
    def train(self, data):
        # Train the model on provided dataset
        pass
        
    def predict(self, input_data):
        # Predict outcomes using the trained model
        pass

class EnvironmentSimulator:
    def simulate(self):
        # Simulate scenarios and provide feedback
        return np.random.rand()  # Example feedback output

class MetricsAnalyzer:
    def analyze(self, results):
        # Analyze results and generate insights
        pass

class DataRepository:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_storage = []
        
    def store_data(self, data):
        self.data_storage.append(data)
        
    def retrieve_data(self):
        return self.data_storage

class SelfEvolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategy_manager = RecursiveStrategyManager()
        self.learning_engine = LearningEngine()
        self.simulator = EnvironmentSimulator()
        self.analyzer = MetricsAnalyzer()
        self.data_repo = DataRepository()
        
    def run(self):
        # Main loop for self-evolution
        while True:
            results = self.simulator.simulate()
            self.data_repo.store_data(results)
            self.strategy_manager.evolve(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    evolver = SelfEvolver()
    evolver.run()
```

This skeleton provides a foundation for integrating recursive and adaptive learning strategies in the PTM empire's autonomy stack. Further development can include integrating advanced ML algorithms, extending simulator capabilities, and implementing robust feedback mechanisms for recursive enhancement.
