To design a new Python module for the PTM (Perpetually Transforming Module) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack, we need to consider the core functionalities that enable recursive strategy deployment. Below is an outline and basic implementation of a Python module to serve this purpose. This module will focus on recursive problem-solving and self-improvement.

### Key Components

1. **Recursive Strategy Pattern**: Use recursive functions to break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems.
2. **Self-Improvement Mechanism**: Implement a learn-by-doing approach that adjusts parameters based on previous results.
3. **Autonomy through Decision Trees**: Use decision trees to make intelligent decisions recursively.
4. **Data-Driven Adaptation**: Continuously adapt using data inputs to refine strategies.

### Python Module: `recursive_autonomy.py`

```python
import random
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
import numpy as np

class RecursiveAutonomy:
    def __init__(self, depth=5, improvement_rate=0.1):
        # Initialize with a decision tree and a learning rate
        self.tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=depth)
        self.improvement_rate = improvement_rate
        self.history = []

    def recursive_solver(self, problem):
        # Base case
        if self.is_simple(problem):
            return self.solve_simple(problem)
        
        # Recursive division of the problem
        sub_problems = self.divide_problem(problem)
        solutions = []
        
        for sub_problem in sub_problems:
            solutions.append(self.recursive_solver(sub_problem))
        
        return self.combine_solutions(solutions)

    def adaptive_improvement(self, data, labels):
        # Fit the tree with historical data for adaptive learning
        self.tree.fit(data, labels)
        
        # Predict and adjust strategy based on outcome
        predictions = self.tree.predict(data)
        
        # Update improvement rate dynamically based on predictions
        success_rate = np.mean(predictions == labels)
        self.improvement_rate *= (1 + success_rate)
        
        print(f'Adaptive Improvement: {self.improvement_rate}')

    def is_simple(self, problem):
        # Check if a problem is considered simple
        return len(problem) <= 2

    def solve_simple(self, problem):
        # Directly solve simple problems
        return sum(problem)  # Example operation

    def divide_problem(self, problem):
        # Split the problem recursively
        mid_point = len(problem) // 2
        return [problem[:mid_point], problem[mid_point:]]

    def combine_solutions(self, solutions):
        # Combine solutions from sub-problems
        return sum(solutions)

    def data_driven_decision(self, situation):
        # Use decision tree to make data-driven decisions
        return self.tree.predict([situation])[0]

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    autonomy_stack = RecursiveAutonomy()
    
    # Dummy data for adaptive improvement
    data = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]])
    labels = np.array([1, 1, 0, 0])  # Example labels
    
    autonomy_stack.adaptive_improvement(data, labels)
    
    problem = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    print("Recursive Solution:", autonomy_stack.recursive_solver(problem))
    
    new_situation = [1, 0]
    print("Data-driven Decision:", autonomy_stack.data_driven_decision(new_situation))
```

### Explanation

- **Recursive Strategy Pattern**: The `recursive_solver` method decomposes a problem until it becomes simple enough to solve directly. It uses recursion to solve each part.
- **Self-Improvement Mechanism**: The `adaptive_improvement` method uses a decision tree to learn from past data and dynamically adjusts the improvement rate.
- **Data-Driven Adaptation**: With `data_driven_decision`, the system can make decisions based on the trained decision tree, adapting as new data becomes available.
- **Example Use Case**: Demonstrates recursive problem solving on a simple problem and adapts using dummy data.

This module provides a foundation that can be expanded with more complex learning algorithms, integration with more data sources, and a user-friendly interface, enabling the PTM empire's autonomy stack to evolve continuously.
