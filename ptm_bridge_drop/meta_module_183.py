Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably Pragmatic Temporal Management) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies requires careful planning and implementation of several key elements. Below is an outline and some example code that might serve as a foundation for such a module. The focus will be on self-adaptation, recursive strategies, and autonomous decision-making.

### Module Objectives:
- Implement Recursive Strategies: Create functions that can recursively adapt and optimize their behavior based on feedback.
- Self-Evolving Mechanisms: Develop components that enable the system to self-improve over time.
- Autonomous Decision-Making: Incorporate decision-making algorithms that allow the system to operate independently.

### Module Outline:
1. **Recursive Strategy Framework**
   - Implement recursive functions for dynamic problem solving.
   - Use recursive learning loops for continuous improvement.

2. **Self-Evolving Algorithms**
   - Integrate machine learning models that can adapt based on new data.
   - Use genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning to foster evolution.

3. **Autonomous Decision Engine**
   - Develop decision trees or neural networks for independent operation.
   - Optimize decision-making processes using real-time feedback loops.

### Sample Code

```python
import random
from functools import lru_cache

class PTMAutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.learning_rate = 0.01
        self.decision_threshold = 0.5
        self.history = []

    def recursive_strategy(self, data, depth=0):
        """ Recursive adaptive strategy for problem-solving. """
        if depth > self.determine_max_depth(data):
            return self.base_case_solution(data)
        
        # Simulate a decision point and adapt based on feedback
        decision = self.decision_engine(data)
        feedback = self.get_feedback(decision)
        
        # Recurse with new data or modified parameters
        new_data = self.adapt_parameters(data, feedback)
        return self.recursive_strategy(new_data, depth + 1)
    
    def determine_max_depth(self, data):
        """ Determine the maximum depth for recursion, adaptive to data complexity. """
        return min(10, len(data) // 2)

    def base_case_solution(self, data):
        """ Provide a solution when base case is met. """
        # Simplified example: return a constant solution
        return sum(data) / len(data) if data else 0

    def decision_engine(self, data):
        """ Make autonomous decisions based on the given data. """
        # Placeholder decision process
        normalized_data = [x / sum(data) for x in data]
        return sum(normalized_data) > self.decision_threshold

    def get_feedback(self, decision):
        """ Simulate feedback based on decision. """
        self.history.append(decision)
        return random.random() < self.learning_rate  # Simulated feedback, skewed for learning rate

    def adapt_parameters(self, data, feedback):
        """ Adapt parameters based on feedback received. """
        # Simplistic adaptive strategy: modify data slightly
        return [x * (1 + self.learning_rate if feedback else 1 - self.learning_rate) for x in data]

# Example Use
autonomy_stack = PTMAutonomyStack()
initial_data = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(10)]
solution = autonomy_stack.recursive_strategy(initial_data)

print("Final Solution:", solution)
print("Decision History:", autonomy_stack.history)
```

### Key Concepts:
- **Recursive Strategy:** The function `recursive_strategy` implements a recursive approach where each recursion adapts parameters based on feedback.
- **Feedback Loop:** After each decision, feedback simulates real-world responses that inform parameter adaptation.
- **Decision Engine:** Uses a placeholder decision-making process to illustrate autonomous operation, which could be expanded with more complex models like neural networks.
- **Self-Evolving Mechanisms:** Through feedback and learning rate adjustments, the stack continuously updates its behavior.

### Future Enhancements:
- **Integration with Machine Learning Libraries:** Incorporate libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for more sophisticated models.
- **Scalability:** Enhance the module to handle larger datasets and more complex recursive structures.
- **Real-World Feedback:** Replace simulated feedback with data from sensors or user inputs.

This sample module provides an initial structure for the PTM empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack with recursive strategies and self-adaptation. Real-world applications should consider incorporating more robust algorithms and methodologies to handle the complexity of real-world scenarios.
