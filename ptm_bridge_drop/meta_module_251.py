Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "Partially Trustworthy Machine") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can adapt and improve over time. To do this, we can leverage recursive strategies, where the system not only performs tasks but also continuously refines its processes and decision-making abilities. Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of how you can structure such a module:

```python
# ptm_auto.py

import random
import logging

# Setting up basic logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

class AutonomousEntity:
    def __init__(self, capabilities=None):
        if capabilities is None:
            capabilities = {}
        self.capabilities = capabilities

    def expand_capabilities(self):
        logging.debug("Expanding capabilities.")
        self.capabilities[random.choice(['vision', 'planning', 'navigation'])] = random.random()

    def evaluate_performance(self):
        logging.debug("Evaluating performance.")
        return sum(self.capabilities.values()) / len(self.capabilities) if self.capabilities else 0

    def adapt_strategy(self):
        logging.debug("Adapting strategy based on performance evaluation.")
        performance = self.evaluate_performance()
        # Implementing a simple recursive improvement
        if performance < 0.5:
            logging.debug("Performance < 0.5; expanding capabilities.")
            self.expand_capabilities()
        else:
            logging.debug("Performance >= 0.5; refining existing strategies.")
            for capability in self.capabilities:
                self.capabilities[capability] *= 1.1  # Refinement through slight improvement

    def self_evolve(self, iterations=10):
        logging.debug("Starting self-evolution process.")
        for i in range(iterations):
            logging.debug(f"Iteration {i+1}/{iterations}")
            self.adapt_strategy()
            logging.info(f"Iteration {i+1} complete. Current capabilities: {self.capabilities}")

def main():
    # Create an initial autonomous entity with a given set of capabilities
    initial_capabilities = {
        'vision': 0.3,
        'planning': 0.4
    }

    entity = AutonomousEntity(initial_capabilities)
    entity.self_evolve(iterations=15)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:

1. **AutonomousEntity Class**: Represents the core autonomous system. It begins with a set of initial capabilities, which can evolve over time.

2. **Recursive Strategy**:
   - **expand_capabilities**: Randomly adds new capabilities or improves existing ones. This simulates the exploration aspect.
   - **evaluate_performance**: Returns a score based on current capabilities.
   - **adapt_strategy**: A recursive strategy that evaluates performance and adapts based on the evaluation. If performance is low, it attempts to expand capabilities. If it's moderate or high, it refines existing strategies.

3. **Self-evolving Process**: This is achieved through the `self_evolve()` method, which iteratively improves the entity's capabilities over a number of iterations.

4. **Logging**: Utilizes Python's logging library to trace the system's evolution and decision-making process.

This approach incorporates basic evolutionary principles like exploration and exploitation, which are recursive in nature. This simplistic prototype can be expanded with more sophisticated learning algorithms, such as reinforcement learning, neural networks, or evolutionary strategies for better real-world applications.
