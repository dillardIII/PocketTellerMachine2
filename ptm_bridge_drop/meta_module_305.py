Designing a new Python module for enhancing the self-evolving autonomy stack of a PTM (Presumably Pre-trained Model) empire is an exciting challenge. This involves creating a system capable of recursive self-improvement, learning autonomously from data, and potentially redesigning parts of itself for optimal performance. Here's how you can approach this:

### Module Overview

The module, named `AutoRecursive`, will focus on recursive strategies that can autonomously adapt and improve the model's capabilities. Key features include meta-learning, self-optimization, and dynamic architecture adaptation.

### Key Features

1. **Meta-Learning Framework**: 
   - Implement tools to facilitate learning patterns across tasks to improve task-agnostic performance.
   - Utilize techniques like Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML).

2. **Recursive Self-Improvement**:
   - Define mechanisms allowing recursive improvements, i.e., the model should be able to evaluate its performance and architecture to propose enhancements.

3. **Dynamic Architecture Adaptation**:
   - Leverage neural architecture search (NAS) techniques to allow the model to adapt its computational graph dynamically.
   - Integrate methods like pruning and neuron growth based on performance metrics.

4. **Automated Feature Engineering**:
   - Include automated feature selection and creation to enhance the model's ability to learn from different data types.

5. **Continuous Learning Pipelines**:
   - Develop pipelines that support continuous learning and adaptation across distributed systems.

6. **Scalable Training and Inference**:
   - Ensure the architecture scales efficiently with data and model size.

### Implementation Details

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import random
from torchvision import datasets, transforms

class AutoRecursive:
    def __init__(self, base_model, meta_learner, nas_strategy):
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.meta_learner = meta_learner
        self.nas_strategy = nas_strategy

    def meta_train(self, tasks):
        for task in tasks:
            learner = self.meta_learner.clone()
            learner.adapt(task)
            self.base_model.update(learner)

    def recursive_improvement(self):
        performance = self.evaluate_performance(self.base_model)
        if performance < self.threshold:
            self.base_model = self.nas_strategy.search(self.base_model)
        
    def evaluate_performance(self, model):
        # Example evaluation function
        return random.uniform(0, 1)  # Replace with actual performance evaluation

    def dynamic_adaptation(self):
        # Add logic for pruning or expanding architecture based on performance
        self.base_model = self.nas_strategy.adapt(self.base_model)

    def train(self, data_loader):
        for data in data_loader:
            input, target = data
            output = self.base_model(input)
            loss = self.loss_function(output, target)
            loss.backward()
            self.base_model.optimizer.step()

    def infer(self, input_data):
        with torch.no_grad():
            return self.base_model(input_data)

# Example use
def main():
    base_model = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(784, 256), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(256, 10))  # Simple feedforward network
    nas_strategy = NeuralArchitectureSearch()
    meta_learner = MetaLearner()

    autoRecursive = AutoRecursive(base_model, meta_learner, nas_strategy)

    # Simulate loading data and training
    transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor()])
    train_dataset = datasets.MNIST('.', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
    train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

    autoRecursive.train(train_loader)  # Train model
    autoRecursive.meta_train(tasks=[...])  # Simulate meta-training
    autoRecursive.recursive_improvement()  # Check and apply improvements

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Notes

- **Meta-Learner and NAS Strategy**: These would be abstract classes or interfaces in a production system. Customize them with specific algorithms and implementations.
  
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: The above code provides a rudimentary structure. Advanced techniques would involve reinforcement learning-based adjustments and complex model evaluations.

- **Evaluation and Benchmarking**: Implement robust evaluation techniques to measure improvement continuously.

- **Scalability and Distribution**: Focus on making the code efficient and distributed to handle large-scale data and model operations.

This module serves as a foundation. As you integrate domain-specific insights and continuously refine recursive strategies, the system's autonomous capabilities will become more sophisticated and agile in adapting to new challenges.
