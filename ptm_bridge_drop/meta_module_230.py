Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical empire) self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a framework that allows various autonomous systems to evolve and improve through recursive strategies. Hereâ€™s an outline for such a module named `ptm_autonomy` that emphasizes innovation, recursion, and self-improvement:

### Module Structure

```
ptm_autonomy/
    __init__.py
    sensors.py
    actuators.py
    autonomy_core.py
    learning.py
    recursion_strategy.py
    utils.py
```

### Module Components

#### 1. `sensors.py`

- **Purpose**: Interface with different sensory modules.
- **Functions**:
  - `read_sensor_data(sensor_type)`: Connects with diverse sensors and retrieves data.
  - `filter_noise(data)`: Applies noise reduction algorithms.

#### 2. `actuators.py`

- **Purpose**: Control and manage actuators in the system.
- **Functions**:
  - `execute_command(command_type, parameters)`: Executes specific commands on the hardware.
  - `feedback_loop()`: Monitors actuator performance and ensures task completion.

#### 3. `autonomy_core.py`

- **Purpose**: Central coordination of autonomous processes.
- **Classes**:
  - `AutonomousAgent`: Manages the lifecycle of an autonomous entity.
    - `initialize()`: Sets up necessary states and parameters.
    - `decide_action(sensor_data)`: Determines the next action based on sensor input.
    - `evaluate_feedback(feedback)`: Adjusts parameters based on outcomes.

#### 4. `learning.py`

- **Purpose**: Implements learning algorithms that support self-evolution.
- **Functions**:
  - `reinforcement_learning(agent)`: Applies RL to maximize agent performance.
  - `genetic_algorithm(population)`: Uses genetic algorithms for optimizing decision rules.
  - `neural_network_training(data)`: Trains neural networks for complex pattern recognition.

#### 5. `recursion_strategy.py`

- **Purpose**: Defines recursive strategies that allow for self-improvement over time.
- **Functions**:
  - `recursive_evaluation(agent)`: Periodically evaluates and adapts strategies.
  - `layered_recursion()`: Implements a multi-layer recursive strategy where changes in one layer influence others.
  - `meta_learning(agent_history)`: Uses past experiences to improve learning algorithms themselves.

#### 6. `utils.py`

- **Purpose**: Support functions and utilities.
- **Functions**:
  - `log_performance(agent)`: Records agent performance metrics for future analysis.
  - `parameter_sweep(params)`: Explores various parameter settings.

### Implementation Example

```python
# ptm_autonomy/recursion_strategy.py

def recursive_evaluation(agent):
    """
    Periodically evaluates the agent's performance and recursively updates strategies.
    """
    performance_score = utils.log_performance(agent)
    if performance_score < threshold:
        # Trigger recursive strategy adjustment
        agent.adjust_strategy()
        agent.decide_action(agent.current_state)

def layered_recursion():
    """
    Implements layered recursion for complex, multi-tier adaptation processes.
    """
    layer_states = initialize_layers()
    for layer in layer_states:
        update_layer(layer)
        recursive_evaluation(layer)

def meta_learning(agent_history):
    """
    Applies meta-learning by leveraging past agent history to improve evolutionary processes.
    """
    for record in agent_history:
        # Use past data to inform adjustment
        optimize_learning_algorithm(record)
```

### Key Innovations

- **Recursive Evaluation**: Continuously evaluates and improves decision-making strategies.
- **Layered Recursion**: Implements recursion across different levels or layers, allowing for more sophisticated adaptation.
- **Meta-Learning**: Employs historical data to refine the efficiency of learning algorithms themselves.

### Conclusion

The `ptm_autonomy` module is designed to be a robust framework for increasing the ecological and operational adaptability of autonomous systems within the PTM. Its focus on recursive strategies ensures that the systems can self-evolve and adapt to changing environments and requirements.
