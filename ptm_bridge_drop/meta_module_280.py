Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably referring to a specific entity or a conceptual empire in AI development) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves developing a system that can adapt, learn, and evolve its capabilities over time. Here's a conceptual outline and implementation strategy for this module, focusing on innovative recursive strategies:

### Module Overview

The module, named `evo_autonomy`, aims to enable self-evolution of models and systems by integrating recursive strategies for learning and decision-making. This involves self-assessment, adaptation, and improvement.

### Key Features

1. **Self-assessment**: Models evaluate their performance and capabilities dynamically.
2. **Recursive Learning**: Incorporates feedback loops for continuous learning and improvement.
3. **Evolutionary Strategies**: Uses genetic algorithms to explore and optimize model architectures and parameters.
4. **Modular Design**: Components are easily interchangeable, fostering integration and scalability.

### Implementation Components

1. **Performance Monitoring**

   ```python
   class PerformanceMonitor:
       def __init__(self):
           self.history = []

       def assess(self, model_output, ground_truth):
           error = self.evaluate_error(model_output, ground_truth)
           self.history.append(error)
           return error

       def evaluate_error(self, prediction, target):
           # Implement error evaluation, e.g., mean squared error
           return ((prediction - target) ** 2).mean()

       def current_performance(self):
           # Return the latest assessment score
           return self.history[-1] if self.history else None
   ```

2. **Recursive Learner**

   ```python
   class RecursiveLearner:
       def __init__(self, model):
           self.model = model

       def learn(self, data, target, iterations=10):
           for _ in range(iterations):
               self.model.train(data, target)
               performance = self.evaluate_learning(data, target)
               if self.check_improvement(performance):
                   data, target = self.enhance_data(data, target)
                   # Optionally, adjust learning parameters recursively
               # Add recursive learning logic here

       def evaluate_learning(self, data, target):
           predictions = self.model.predict(data)
           error = ((predictions - target) ** 2).mean()
           return error

       def check_improvement(self, performance):
           # Implement a check for performance improvement
           return performance < threshold

       def enhance_data(self, data, target):
           # Optionally augment or adjust the data for better learning
           return data, target
   ```

3. **Evolutionary Strategy Module**

   ```python
   import random

   class EvolutionaryStrategy:
       def __init__(self, population_size, mutation_rate):
           self.population_size = population_size
           self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate
           self.population = self.initialize_population()

       def initialize_population(self):
           # Create a starting population of models/strategies
           return [self.create_random_model() for _ in range(self.population_size)]

       def evolve(self, data, target, generations=10):
           for _ in range(generations):
               performance = [(model, self.evaluate_model(model, data, target))
                              for model in self.population]
               performance.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort by performance
               self.population = self.selection(performance)
               self.mutate_population()

       def evaluate_model(self, model, data, target):
           predictions = model.predict(data)
           error = ((predictions - target) ** 2).mean()
           return error

       def selection(self, sorted_population):
           # Implement selection logic (e.g., take top performers)
           return [model for model, _ in sorted_population[:self.population_size // 2]]

       def mutate_population(self):
           for model in self.population:
               if random.random() < self.mutation_rate:
                   self.mutate_model(model)

       def mutate_model(self, model):
           # Implement model mutation logic
           pass

       def create_random_model(self):
           # Create a random model/strategy instance
           return Model()
   ```

### Module Integration

The module can be integrated into a broader autonomy stack, allowing each component to interact and share information. For instance, the `PerformanceMonitor` can guide the `RecursiveLearner` in real-time, and strategies from the `EvolutionaryStrategy` can spawn new learners or adjust existing ones.

### Future Expansions

- **Meta-Learning**: Introduce meta-learning strategies to enhance learning speed and efficiency.
- **Cross-Domain Learning**: Encourage strategies that transfer knowledge across different domains or tasks.
- **Collaborative Multi-Agent Systems**: Facilitate communication and collaboration between multiple autonomous agents, leveraging collective intelligence.

This module serves as a foundational block for building an autonomous system that not only learns from its experience but also evolves to handle new challenges efficiently.
