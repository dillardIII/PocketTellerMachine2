Designing a new Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably Partially True Model) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with recursive strategies involves several key components. Below is a high-level design, along with some Python code snippets to illustrate concepts.

### Key Components:

1. **Recursive Learning Module**: This module should be capable of self-improvement by recursively evaluating its performance and updating its strategies.

2. **Self-Evolving Algorithms**: Implement algorithms that evolve their structure or parameters over time based on feedback from the environment.

3. **Adaptive Environment Interaction**: The module should interact with its environment, gather data, and learn from it in a cyclical manner.

4. **Fallback and Redundancy**: Implement mechanisms to ensure the system can revert to a known good state in case an evolutionary strategy fails.

#### 1. `core.py`

This file is the central hub that integrates all functionalities.

```python
class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategy = None
        self.environment = None

    def load_environment(self, env_config):
        from environment_interaction import EnvironmentInterface
        self.environment = EnvironmentInterface(env_config)

    def set_initial_strategy(self, strategy):
        self.strategy = strategy

    def evolve(self):
        from recursive_learning import RecursiveLearning
        learner = RecursiveLearning(self.environment, self.strategy)
        self.strategy = learner.evolve_strategy()

    def execute(self):
        return self.environment.execute_strategy(self.strategy)
```

#### 2. `recursive_learning.py`

This file focuses on the recursive learning process.

```python
class RecursiveLearning:
    def __init__(self, environment, strategy):
        self.environment = environment
        self.strategy = strategy

    def evolve_strategy(self):
        # Placeholder for functionality to recursively improve the strategy
        results = self.environment.evaluate(self.strategy)
        updated_strategy = self._adjust_strategy(self.strategy, results)
        return updated_strategy

    def _adjust_strategy(self, strategy, results):
        # Implement adjustment logic here
        # For example, using a genetic algorithm or neural network updates
        # Recursive evaluation and update
        new_strategy = strategy # Placeholder for updated strategy
        return new_strategy
```

#### 3. `evolutionary_algorithms.py`

This file encompasses various mechanisms for strategy evolution.

```python
class EvolutionaryAlgorithm:
    def __init__(self, strategy):
        self.strategy = strategy

    def mutate(self):
        # Implement mutation logic here
        pass

    def crossover(self, other_strategy):
        # Implement crossover logic here
        pass

    def select(self, population, fitness_func):
        # Implement selection mechanism
        pass
```

#### 4. `environment_interaction.py`

This file defines how the module interacts with the environment.

```python
class EnvironmentInterface:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.state = self.initialize_state(config)

    def initialize_state(self, config):
        # Initial state setup based on config
        return {}

    def evaluate(self, strategy):
        # Evaluate current strategy in the environment
        return {"performance": 0}  # Placeholder

    def execute_strategy(self, strategy):
        # Implement execution logic for a strategy
        return True
```

#### 5. `utils.py`

Utility functions that support the main modules.

```python
def log_performance(metrics):
    # Log performance metrics for analysis
    pass

def backup_state(state):
    # Create a backup of the current state
    pass
```

### Recursive Strategies:

- **Meta-Learning**: Implement meta-learning techniques to allow the strategy to learn not just from data but also from feedback about previous learning processes.

- **Dynamic Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use strategies that evolve hyperparameters dynamically based on changing environments.

- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Consider multiple objectives in optimization to ensure a balance between exploration and exploitation.

### Conclusion

This modular design allows the PTM empire's autonomy stack to flexibly incorporate new developments and adjust to dynamic environments. Through recursive learning and self-evolving algorithms, the module maintains robust and resilient autonomy, aimed at continuous improvement.
