Creating a new Python module to expand an autonomous system, particularly for something as complex as a "self-evolving autonomy stack" for an organization like PTM, involves several innovative and technical components. Below, I'll outline a conceptual design and some example code snippets for implementing recursive strategies in Python.

### Conceptual Overview

1. **Autonomy Stack Layers**:
    - **Sensing and Perception**: Collecting data from the environment.
    - **Decision Making**: Analyzing data to make informed decisions.
    - **Planning and Control**: Executing decisions with real-time adjustments.
    - **Learning and Adaptation**: Using machine learning to adapt and improve over time.

2. **Recursive Strategies**:
    - **Self-Optimization**: Recursive functions for tuning algorithms beneath each layer.
    - **Meta-Learning**: Implementing meta-algorithms that improve the learning process itself.
    - **Feedback Loops**: Continuous feedback mechanisms to reinforce or adjust system parameters.

### Python Module Design

Below is a simplified structure for a Python module that implements some of these concepts.

```python
# ptm_autonomy.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

class Sensing:
    def collect_data(self):
        # Simulate data collection
        return np.random.rand(100, 5)

class Perception:
    def process_data(self, data):
        # Process data to extract features
        return np.mean(data, axis=0)

class DecisionMaking:
    def make_decision(self, features):
        # Imagine a decision-making process
        threshold = 0.5
        return np.where(features > threshold, 1, 0)

class Learning:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = LinearRegression()

    def train(self, X, y):
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions = self.model.predict(X_test)
        return mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)

    def adapt(self, error):
        # Recursively adjust model parameters based on error
        if error > 0.1:
            self.model.coef_ += 0.01 * np.sign(self.model.coef_)

class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sensing = Sensing()
        self.perception = Perception()
        self.decider = DecisionMaking()
        self.learning = Learning()

    def run_cycle(self):
        # Recursive cycle for the autonomy stack
        raw_data = self.sensing.collect_data()
        features = self.perception.process_data(raw_data)
        decision = self.decider.make_decision(features)
        
        # Simulate a target outcome for training purposes
        target = np.random.randint(0, 2, features.shape)
        
        # Learning cycle
        error = self.learning.train(features.reshape(-1, 1), target)
        self.learning.adapt(error)

        # Feedback loop for recursive optimization
        while error > 0.05:
            error = self.learning.train(features.reshape(-1, 1), target)
            self.learning.adapt(error)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    autonomy_stack = AutonomyStack()
    autonomy_stack.run_cycle()
```

### Explanation

- **Collecting and Processing Data**: The `Sensing` and `Perception` classes simulate data collection and feature extraction.
- **Decision Making**: The `DecisionMaking` class simulates a simple decision process using a threshold.
- **Learning with Adaptation**: The `Learning` class implements a basic linear regression model that adapts based on the error through a recursive strategy.
- **Feedback Loop**: The `AutonomyStack` runs these processes in a loop, using feedback to adjust and improve its decision-making capabilities.

### Innovative Aspects

- **Recursive Optimization**: The `Learning` class recursively adjusts its model parameters based on error, illustrating a self-optimization strategy.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: The module uses a feedback loop to ensure decisions improve over iterations.
- **Modular Design**: The autonomy stack is designed in layers, allowing each layer to evolve and adapt independently.

This code provides a foundational framework. In a real-world scenario, you would integrate advanced algorithms (e.g., deep learning, reinforcement learning) and consider multiple modalities of data and decisions for a more comprehensive autonomy stack.
