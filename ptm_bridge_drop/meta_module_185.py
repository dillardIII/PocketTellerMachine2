Designing a Python module for expanding an autonomy stack that leverages self-evolving and recursive strategies involves integrating machine learning, adaptive algorithms, and system architecture that allows for continuous self-improvement. Below is a conceptual design outline and a code snippet to illustrate the core components of this module:

### Conceptual Design Outline:

1. **System Architecture:**
   - **Core Component:** Central Hub for Decision-Making.
   - **Learning Unit:** Handles data ingestion and model updates.
   - **Feedback Loop:** Collects execution data for performance evaluation.
   - **Recursive Strategy Engine:** Optimizes decision-making through recursion.

2. **Key Features:**
   - **Self-Learning Models:** Utilize reinforcement learning for continuous improvement.
   - **Recursive Algorithms:** Implement depth/breadth evaluations for decision processes.
   - **Autonomous Feedback:** Real-time feedback for process correction and adjustment.
   - **Scalable Architecture:** Design for scalability and integration with existing systems.

3. **Innovative Strategies:**
   - **Recursive Decision Trees:** To dynamically adjust the strategy based on historical feedback.
   - **Predictive Analysis:** Use recursive neural networks for trend detection and prediction.
   - **Self-Healing Algorithms:** Identify and correct faults autonomously.

### Sample Python Module Implementation:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from collections import deque

class RecursiveDecisionEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
        self.feedback_buffer = deque(maxlen=100)
    
    def collect_feedback(self, data_point):
        # Collect performance data
        self.feedback_buffer.append(data_point)
    
    def train_model(self, X, y):
        # Train model on new data
        self.model.fit(X, y)
    
    def recursive_strategy(self, state):
        # Recursively evaluate decisions
        possible_actions = self.get_possible_actions(state)
        best_action = None
        best_score = float('-inf')
        for action in possible_actions:
            simulated_state = self.simulate_action(state, action)
            score = self.evaluate_action(simulated_state)
            if score > best_score:
                best_score = score
                best_action = action
        
        # Recurse if possible
        if self.should_recurse(state, best_action):
            return self.recursive_strategy(simulated_state)
        
        return best_action
    
    def get_possible_actions(self, state):
        # Define possible actions in a given state
        return ['action1', 'action2', 'action3']
    
    def simulate_action(self, state, action):
        # Simulate the outcome of an action
        new_state = state.copy()  # Simplified example
        # Implement actual simulation logic here
        return new_state
    
    def evaluate_action(self, state):
        # Evaluate the simulated action's outcome
        # Simplified example using model prediction
        prediction = self.model.predict([state])
        return np.mean(prediction)  # Simplify to a single score
    
    def should_recurse(self, state, action):
        # Logic to determine if further recursion is needed
        # E.g., depth of strategy tree or condition thresholds
        return len(self.feedback_buffer) < 50

    def self_improvement_cycle(self):
        # Periodically update models based on feedback
        if len(self.feedback_buffer) >= self.feedback_buffer.maxlen:
            X, y = zip(*list(self.feedback_buffer))
            self.train_model(np.array(X), np.array(y))

# Example Usage
engine = RecursiveDecisionEngine()
current_state = np.random.rand(10)  # Example state representation
action = engine.recursive_strategy(current_state)
engine.collect_feedback((current_state, 1))  # Example feedback (state, outcome)
engine.self_improvement_cycle()

```

### Explanation:

- The `RecursiveDecisionEngine` class encapsulates the decision-making autonomy.
- **Recursive Strategy:** Designed to evaluate and decide the optimal action recursively.
- **Feedback Loop:** Collects feedback to continuously train the model, encouraging evolution.
- **Simulation and Evaluation:** Models environment interaction, simulating and evaluating actions.
- **Self-Improvement Cycle:** Implements a continuous learning mechanism using collected feedback.

This module provides the foundation for an evolving autonomy stack capable of improving and adjusting its strategies based on recursive evaluations and feedback-driven learning.
