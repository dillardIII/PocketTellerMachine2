Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "Progressive Transport Machine") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a deep integration of recursive strategies and machine learning principles. Here's a conceptual overview of how this module could be structured:

### Module Overview
The module, let's call it `PTMAutonomy`, will feature components that enable recursive learning and decision-making processes, allowing vehicles in the PTM network to autonomously adapt and optimize their operations. The module will be structured into several key components:

1. **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**: Collect and preprocess real-time data from sensors, external databases, and other vehicles.
2. **Recursive Learning Models**: Employ neural networks and reinforcement learning techniques that can recursively self-improve via continuous feedback loops.
3. **Decision-Making Algorithms**: Use recursive decision trees and Monte Carlo simulations to make informed choices about path planning, resource allocation, and task prioritization.
4. **Safety and Compliance Monitors**: Implement rule-checking and anomaly detection to ensure decisions align with safety standards and legal regulations.
5. **Communication Interfaces**: Establish protocols for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, facilitating collaborative problem-solving.

### Core Components

#### 1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scaler = StandardScaler()

    def preprocess(self, sensor_data):
        # Normalize and standardize sensor input data
        normalized_data = self.scaler.fit_transform(sensor_data)
        return normalized_data
```

#### 2. Recursive Learning Models

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class RecursiveNeuralNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(RecursiveNeuralNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        # Recursive LSTM network for time-series prediction
        h_0 = torch.zeros(1, x.size(0), self.hidden_size)
        c_0 = torch.zeros(1, x.size(0), self.hidden_size)
        lstm_out, _ = self.lstm(x, (h_0, c_0))
        predictions = self.fc(lstm_out[:, -1, :])
        return predictions
```

#### 3. Decision-Making Algorithms

```python
import random

class DecisionTreeAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []

    def recursive_decision(self, state):
        # Use past decisions for reinforcement learning
        if state in self.history:
            return self.history[state]
        else:
            decision = self.new_decision_logic(state)
            self.history.append((state, decision))
            return decision

    def new_decision_logic(self, state):
        # Placeholder for decision-making logic
        return random.choice(['move', 'stop', 'wait'])

# Monte Carlo Simulation for path planning
def monte_carlo_simulation(env, num_simulations=1000):
    best_score = float('-inf')
    best_path = None

    for _ in range(num_simulations):
        path, score = run_simulation(env)
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_path = path

    return best_path

def run_simulation(env):
    # Simulate path and calculate score
    path = []
    score = 0
    # ... Simulation logic ...
    return path, score
```

#### 4. Safety and Compliance Monitors

```python
class SafetyMonitor:
    def __init__(self, compliance_rules):
        self.compliance_rules = compliance_rules

    def check_compliance(self, decision):
        for rule in self.compliance_rules:
            if not rule(decision):
                return False
        return True

def speed_limit_rule(decision):
    return decision['speed'] <= decision['max_speed_limit']
```

#### 5. Communication Interfaces

```python
class VehicleCommunication:
    def __init__(self):
        self.network = []

    def broadcast_message(self, message):
        # Send data to all connected vehicles
        for vehicle in self.network:
            vehicle.receive_message(message)

    def receive_message(self, message):
        # Logic to process received message
        pass
```

### Module Integration and Deployment
The module would be integrated into each vehicle's central control system. It involves setting up a continuous integration pipeline to ensure all components work seamlessly together, backed by extensive testing in simulated environments and progressively scaled real-world conditions.

### Future Enhancements
- **Adaptive Simulation Environments**: Develop more advanced environments that adapt to the recursive learning models, feeding them challenges that evolve as the models improve.
- **Behavioral Prediction**: Integrate more sophisticated behavioral prediction models to anticipate actions of other vehicles and pedestrians.
- **Energy Efficiency Optimization**: Incorporate mechanisms to optimize energy consumption based on real-time data analysis.

This framework provides a starting point for creating an advanced autonomous stack that leverages recursive strategies for continual self-improvement and optimal decision-making in real-time environments.
