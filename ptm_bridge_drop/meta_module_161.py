Creating a Python module for the PTM (Presumably some technological or research entity) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a deep integration of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and possibly reinforcement learning techniques. The core idea here would be to create a system that can adapt, learn, and improve itself over time using recursive strategies.

Here's a high-level design of such a module with some examples of how recursive strategies might be implemented:

### Module Name: Hyperea

#### Overview
The Hyperea module will be designed to enhance the autonomy stack of PTM by leveraging recursive self-improvement and learning strategies. The module should focus on data-driven decision-making, self-refinement, and adaptation to new environments or tasks.

#### Core Components

1. **Recursive Learning Engine (RLE):**
   - **Objective:** Implement continual self-improvement using recursive strategies.
   - **Mechanism:** Utilize reinforcement learning where models constantly test and refine their strategies based on feedback.
   - **Features:**
     - Recursive training loops that allow the model to simulate ‘next iterations’ based on previous learning experiences.
     - Utilization of meta-learning strategies to encode how to learn, adapting learning algorithms over time.

2. **Environment Interaction Manager (EIM):**
   - **Objective:** Enhance the model's ability to interact with and learn from its environment.
   - **Mechanism:** Implements `agents` that can simulate environments to allow for model training and adaptation.
   - **Features:**
     - Simulation environments that adapt and change based on the current state of the model.
     - Reward systems that encourage innovative strategies and discourage redundant actions.

3. **Continuous Integration and Testing (CIT):**
   - **Objective:** Ensure that each new iteration of the model integrates seamlessly without degradation in performance.
   - **Mechanism:** Automated testing frameworks that validate each new model iteration against a battery of tests.
   - **Features:**
     - Integration hooks for performing regression tests.
     - A/B testing for new strategies against established baselines.

4. **Data Augmentation and Enrichment (DAE):**
   - **Objective:** Enhance and expand the dataset used for training recursively.
   - **Mechanism:** Leverages synthetic data generation and innovative transformation techniques.
   - **Features:**
     - Automated data augmentation algorithms.
     - Enrichment pipelines that integrate external data sources to ensure a diverse training set.

5. **Adaptive Decision Making Module (ADM):**
   - **Objective:** Make decisions based on ever-evolving context and objectives.
   - **Mechanism:** Implements rule-based and machine learning algorithms for adaptive decision-making.
   - **Features:**
     - Context-aware decision engines that adapt based on both internal learning and external environments.
     - Dynamic threshold adjustments based on continuous feedback loop.

#### Recursive Strategy Implementation

To implement recursive strategies, there can be a framework that includes:

- **Meta-Learning Loops:**
  ```python
  class MetaLearner:
      def __init__(self, base_model, meta_strategy):
          self.base_model = base_model
          self.meta_strategy = meta_strategy

      def adapt(self, data):
          for iteration in range(NUM_ITERATIONS):
              new_model = self.base_model.update(data)
              reward = self.evaluate(new_model, data)
              if reward > self.current_best_score:
                  self.current_best_model = new_model
                  self.current_best_score = reward
  ```

- **Agent-Based Environment Simulation:**
  ```python
  class AgentSimulator:
      def __init__(self, environments, agent):
          self.environments = environments
          self.agent = agent

      def run_simulation(self):
          for env in self.environments:
              state = env.reset()
              done = False
              while not done:
                  action = self.agent.decide(state)
                  state, reward, done = env.step(action)
                  self.agent.learn(state, reward)
  ```

- **Continuous Evaluation and Adaptation:**
  ```python
  class ContinuityGuard:
      def __init__(self, model):
          self.model = model

      def evaluate_and_adapt(self, data):
          score = self.model.evaluate(data)
          if self.improvement_criterion(score):
              self.model.adapt()

      def improvement_criterion(self, score):
          # Define your criteria for what constitutes improvement
          return score > self.model.previous_score
  ```

This high-level module design will allow the PTM empire to continuously improve and push towards greater autonomy by applying recursive and sustainable AI strategies. It’s key to ensure that all components remain modular and extensible for future improvements and iterations.
