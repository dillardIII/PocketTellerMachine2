Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a theoretical concept here) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can learn, adapt, and evolve over time. The focus here is on building a recursive, self-improving framework that leverages modern AI/ML techniques and recursive strategies. Here's a conceptual outline for the module:

### Module Overview
The module, named `self_evolver`, is designed to integrate with the PTM empire's existing systems. It uses recursive strategies to continually improve its performance on various tasks through reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms, and neural architecture search.

### Key Features

1. **Recursive Learning Engine**: Utilizes recursive strategies to iteratively improve models by employing techniques such as self-play, bootstrapping, and meta-learning.

2. **Evolutionary Algorithm Integration**: Incorporates genetic algorithms to explore a wide range of neural architectures, hyperparameters, and decision strategies, evolving effective models over generations.

3. **Dynamic Task Allocation**: Utilizes a task manager to identify, classify, and allocate tasks to suitable models, evolving strategies based on performance metrics.

4. **Adaptive Knowledge Base**: Continuously updates its knowledge repository through experience and external data sources, enhancing decision-making processes and model performance.

5. **Self-Monitoring and Diagnostics**: Implements a self-monitoring system to automatically detect failures, anomalies, or inefficiencies, prompting corrective actions through recursive learning and adaptation.

class NeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self, layers: List[int]):
        # Initialize a neural network with the given layer structure
        pass

    def forward(self, inputs: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        # Perform forward propagation
        pass

    def mutate(self):
        # Apply genetic mutations to this network
        pass

        # Clone the network for future generations
        pass

        pass

# Recursive Learning and Evolution
class SelfEvolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models: List[NeuralNetwork] = []
        self.generations = 0

    def evolve(self):
        # Evolve the models using recursive strategies
        new_models = []
        for model in self.models:
            new_model = model.clone()
            new_model.mutate()
            new_models.append(new_model)
        self.models.extend(new_models)
        self.generations += 1

    def adapt(self, task: Task):
        # Adapt models to new tasks using reinforcement learning
        pass

    def self_monitor(self):
        # Perform self-diagnostics and adjust strategies
        pass

# Knowledge base which continuously updates itself
class KnowledgeBase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data: Dict[Any, Any] = {}

    def update_knowledge(self, info: Any):
        # Integrate new information into the knowledge base
        pass

    def query(self, item: Any) -> Any:
        # Query the knowledge base for information
        pass

# Main interface for the module
class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.evolver = SelfEvolver()
        self.task_manager = TaskManager()
        self.knowledge_base = KnowledgeBase()

    def run(self):
        # Main loop for the autonomy stack
        while True:
            task = self.detect_new_task()
            self.task_manager.allocate_task(task)

            self.evolver.adapt(task)
            self.evolver.evolve()

            self.evolver.self_monitor()
            # Additional logic to manage the autonomy stack

    def detect_new_task(self) -> Task:
        # Simulate task detection
        return Task(description="Sample Task", complexity=random.randint(1, 10))

```

### Recursive Strategies

- **Self-Play**: Enable models to compete against themselves, learning optimal strategies iteratively.
- **Bootstrapping**: Continuously refine models by using outputs of prior models as inputs for new versions.
- **Meta-Learning**: Utilize a meta-level learning strategy to adjust the learning algorithms themselves, adapting to new tasks effectively.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Parallel Processing**: Use parallel processing to handle simultaneous tasks and model evaluations.
- **Scalability**: Design architecture to be scalable across distributed systems for extensive task domains.
- **Security and Reliability**: Implement security features to ensure safe operations within the PTM empire.

This module conceptually outlines how recursive strategies can help an autonomy stack adapt and evolve, supporting the overarching mission of the PTM empire.
