Creating a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably, an organization or system focused on autonomous technology) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves several innovative and recursive strategies. Below is a conceptual design for such a module, focusing on creating a robust, self-improving, and adaptable architecture.

### Module: AERIS (Autonomous Evolution Recursive Intelligence System)

#### Key Features:
1. **Recursive Self-Improvement:**
   - Integrate machine learning models that can update themselves using fresh data inputs without human intervention.
   - Recursive loops for continuous model retraining based on environmental feedback.

2. **Hierarchical Learning:**
   - Utilize a hierarchical architecture where different modules learn at various abstraction levels.
   - Implement neural networks with recursive neural pathways to refine decision-making processes.

3. **Contextual Adaptation:**
   - Develop algorithms that dynamically adapt to new contexts by recognizing shifts in data patterns.

4. **Hybrid Learning Mechanism:**
   - Combine reinforcement learning with unsupervised learning to allow systems to self-improve even in uncharted territories.
  
5. **Swarm Intelligence:**
   - Leverage distributed autonomous agents that collaborate and learn from each other's experiences.

#### Module Design

Here's a skeleton structure of how AERIS might be implemented in Python:

```python
# aeris.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, LSTM
import random

class RecursiveNeuralNet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = keras.Sequential([
            LSTM(128, input_shape=(None, 50), return_sequences=True),
            Dense(50, activation='relu'),
            Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
        ])
        self.model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    def train(self, data, labels):
        self.model.fit(data, labels, epochs=5)
    
    def predict(self, data):
        return self.model.predict(data)

class HierarchicalLearner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.levels = []

    def add_level(self, model):
        self.levels.append(model)

    def train(self, data, labels):
        for model in self.levels:
            model.train(data, labels)

    def predict(self, data):
        for model in self.levels:
            data = model.predict(data)
        return data

class SwarmAgent:
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id
        self.neural_network = RecursiveNeuralNet()

    def synchronize(self, other_agents):
        # Share weights or strategies
        for agent in other_agents:
            self.blend_weights(agent)

    def blend_weights(self, agent):
        # Assuming both models are the same architecture
        weights = self.neural_network.model.get_weights()
        other_weights = agent.neural_network.model.get_weights()
        new_weights = [(w1 + w2) / 2 for w1, w2 in zip(weights, other_weights)]
        self.neural_network.model.set_weights(new_weights)

    def train(self, data, labels):
        self.neural_network.train(data, labels)

    def predict(self, data):
        return self.neural_network.predict(data)

def adaptive_clustering(data):
    pca = PCA(n_components=5)
    reduced_data = pca.fit_transform(data)
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
    clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(reduced_data)
    return clusters

def main():
    # Initialize Agents
    agents = [SwarmAgent(i) for i in range(10)]
    
    # Collective Training
    data, labels = np.random.rand(1000, 50), np.random.randint(2, size=1000)
    for agent in agents:
        agent.train(data, labels)
    
    # Synchronizing agent knowledge
    for agent in agents:
        agent.synchronize([a for a in agents if a.id != agent.id])
    
    # Predict new data
    new_data = np.random.rand(10, 50)
    predictions = np.mean([agent.predict(new_data) for agent in agents], axis=0)
    
    print(predictions)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation:
- **RecursiveNeuralNet**: A recurrent neural network with LSTM layers used for recursive learning processes.
- **HierarchicalLearner**: A structure for hierarchical self-training where predictions cascade through levels.
- **SwarmAgent**: Models individual agents in a swarm of autonomous learners. They can synchronize and blend strategies to improve performance collectively.
- **adaptive_clustering**: An example of adaptive learning method to categorize data into clusters for analysis.
- **Self-improving loop**: Implements a basic main function demonstrating recursive agent learning and adaptation.

### Considerations:
- **Scalability**: Ensure the system can handle increasing data sizes and computational loads.
- **Security**: Safeguard the autonomous systems from adversarial attacks and data breaches.
- **Ethical AI**: Ensure that all learning and evolution are aligned with ethical AI standards, avoiding biases and unintended behavior.

This module provides a starting framework that can be expanded with more specific strategies and models tailored to PTMâ€™s requirements.
