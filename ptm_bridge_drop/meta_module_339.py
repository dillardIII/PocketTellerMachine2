Designing a new Python module for the PTM (Presumably, an advanced technological platform) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack requires several critical considerations. We need to ensure that the module supports adaptability, scalability, and efficient learning. Here’s an outline of how you could design such a module, incorporating innovative recursive strategies:

### Module Name: `autonomy_evolution`

This module will consist of several components. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Core Concepts:**
    - **Self-improvement:** Autonomy stack should recursively improve based on feedback and experience.
    - **Adaptability:** It should adjust to changes in the environment and task requirements.
    - **Scalability:** Design to work efficiently from local systems to distributed networks.

2. **Key Components:**
    - **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing:**
        - Gather data from various sensors and sources.
        - Preprocess data using adaptive filters to handle noisy or incomplete data.

    - **Learning Algorithms:**
        - Utilize a hybrid approach combining deep learning, reinforcement learning, and evolutionary algorithms.
        - Implement meta-learning techniques for models to learn how to learn.

    - **Recursive Strategy Implementation:**
        - **Recursive Neural Networks (RNN):** Incorporate RNN for processing sequential data, enabling the module to learn temporal and contextual dependencies.
        - **Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI):** Implement RSI where the module analyzes its performance and adjusts strategies iteratively.
        - **Genetic Programming (GP):** Use recursive GP to evolve and optimize algorithms and strategies over generations.

    - **Decision-Making Layer:**
        - Implement a hierarchical decision-making system.
        - Use a recursive decision tree algorithm that can dynamically modify its structure based on feedback and changing requirements.

    - **Simulation Environment:**
        - Develop a sandbox environment for testing recursive strategies.
        - Implement virtual scenarios that mimic real-world challenges for continuous learning.

    - **Feedback and Reinforcement:**
        - Integrate continuous feedback loops.
        - Utilize reinforcement signal propagation to refine decision algorithms.

3. **Interface and API:**
    - Design intuitive input/output interfaces.
    - Implement a RESTful API for easy communication with other modules and external systems.

4. **Security and Privacy:**
    - Incorporate recursive security protocols that adapt to new threats.
    - Ensure privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as differential privacy, are in place.

5. **Monitoring and Debugging Tools:**
    - Develop an observational framework that tracks learning progress and detects anomalies.
    - Implement logging with recursive backtracking to pinpoint issues.

Here's a framework for the module:

```python
# autonomy_evolution/__init__.py

# Import necessary packages
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn import preprocessing
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from copy import deepcopy

class RecursiveNeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the model structure
        pass

    def fit(self, data):
        # Train the RNN model
        pass

    def predict(self, data):
        # Make predictions with the trained model
        pass

class SelfImprovementEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize performance metrics and learning rates
        pass

    def improve(self, model):
        # Recursive self-improvement logic
        pass

class GeneticProgramEvolver:
    def __init__(self):
        # Setup genetic programming parameters
        pass

    def evolve(self, solution_space):
        # Implement recursive evolution logic
        pass

class AutonomyControlSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rnn = RecursiveNeuralNetwork()
        self.sie = SelfImprovementEngine()
        self.gpe = GeneticProgramEvolver()

    def run(self, sensor_data):
        # Main loop: Integrate all components for decision making
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    system = AutonomyControlSystem()
    # Simulate or input sensor data
    data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    system.run(data)
```

### Development and Testing:
- **Continuous Integration:** Integrate with platforms like Jenkins for automated testing.
- **Simulation Testing:** Utilize virtual environments and stress-test scenarios.

### Future Enhancements:
- Introduce advanced natural language processing for decision-making commands.
- Integrate with IoT devices for comprehensive situational awareness.

This design is a high-level overview and should be detailed for production deployment, tailored to meet specific needs of the PTM empire’s autonomy stack.
