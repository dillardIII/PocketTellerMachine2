Designing a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably a conceptual empire related to AI or robotics) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a multi-faceted approach. The module will need to incorporate innovative recursive strategies to enhance decision-making, adaptability, and scalability. Below, I'll outline a conceptual design for such a module:

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Key Features:
1. **Recursive Learning Framework:**
   - **Self-Optimization Algorithms:** Utilize evolutionary strategies and genetic algorithms to optimize performance iteratively.
   - **Reinforcement Learning Integration:** Leverage reinforcement learning for continuous improvement via recursive feedback loops.

2. **Automated Feature Enhancement:**
   - **Recursive Feature Engineering:** Automatically craft and refine features based on recursive analysis of performance metrics.
   - **Meta-Learning:** Implement meta-learning techniques to drive the continuous evolution of learning strategies.

3. **Dynamic Adaptability Engine:**
   - **Context-Aware Adaptation:** Deploy recursive neural networks (RNNs) to analyze and adjust behavior based on environmental context.
   - **Predictive Modeling:** Utilize recursive Bayesian networks for forecasting and adjusting strategies accordingly.

4. **Self-Healing Mechanisms:**
   - **Anomaly Detection:** Implement recursive anomaly detection to identify and correct deviations autonomously.
   - **Fault Tolerance Strategies:** Use redundancy and recursive diagnostics to enhance system robustness.

5. **Distributed Collaboration:**
   - **Swarm Intelligence:** Implement recursive strategies for inter-agent communication and collaboration.
   - **Decentralized Decision Making:** Support autonomous decision-making through blockchain-based consensus.

#### Example Code Outline:

```python
# ptm_autonomy/__init__.py

__version__ = '0.1.0'
__all__ = ['RecursiveLearning', 'FeatureEnhancer', 'AdaptabilityEngine', 'SelfHealingSystem', 'CollaborationModule']

# ptm_autonomy/recursive_learning.py

class RecursiveLearning:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize learning configurations
        self.evolutionary_algorithms = {}
        self.reinforcement_policies = {}
    
    def self_optimize(self):
        # Implement evolutionary optimization logic
        pass
    
    def reinforce_learning(self):
        # Implement reinforcement learning feedback loop
        pass

# ptm_autonomy/feature_enhancer.py

class FeatureEnhancer:
    @staticmethod
    def enhance_features(data):
        # Recursive feature engineering process
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def apply_meta_learning(model, data):
        # Meta-learning strategy application
        pass

# ptm_autonomy/adaptability_engine.py

class AdaptabilityEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize context-aware systems
        pass
    
    def adapt_to_context(self, context_data):
        # Use RNN to adapt based on context
        pass
    
    def predictive_model(self, current_state):
        # Bayesian network prediction
        pass

# ptm_autonomy/self_healing_system.py

class SelfHealingSystem:
    @staticmethod
    def detect_anomalies(system_status):
        # Recursive anomaly detection
        pass
    
    @staticmethod
    def initiate_fault_tolerance():
        # Self-healing fault tolerance process
        pass

# ptm_autonomy/collaboration_module.py

class CollaborationModule:
    def __init__(self):
        # Configure swarm intelligence protocols
        pass
    
    def enable_swarm_communication(self):
        # Recursive strategy for agent communication
        pass
    
    def decentralized_decision_method(self, proposals):
        # Implement decision-making using blockchain consensus
        pass
```

#### Considerations:
- **Scalability:** Ensure algorithms are scalable for deployment across various systems and environments.
- **Interoperability:** Design the module to integrate seamlessly with existing systems and platforms.
- **Security:** Incorporate robust security measures to protect against adversarial manipulation and ensure data integrity.

This design aims to provide a flexible, scalable, and intelligent solution for enhancing the PTM empire's autonomy stack, employing innovative recursive strategies to stay adaptive and forward-looking.
