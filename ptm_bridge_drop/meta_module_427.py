Creating a Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably "Precision Time Module" or another contextual meaning in your environment) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves incorporating recursive strategies and innovative algorithms. Here's an outline and a basic draft for such a module:

### Module Name
`autonomy_expander`

### Key Features
1. **Recursive Learning Algorithms**: Implement algorithms that can recursively improve themselves.
2. **Modular and Scalable**: Designed in a way that allows easy expansion and scalability.
3. **Integration with Existing Systems**: Seamlessly integrates with the PTM's current stack.
4. **Self-Diagnostics and Optimization**: Capable of diagnosing and optimizing its processes autonomously.

### Python Module Design

```python
# autonomy_expander.py

import logging
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import random
import time
import copy

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s %(message)s')

class SelfEvolvingAgent:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.1):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.performance_metrics = {}
    
    def evaluate_performance(self):
        # Placeholder for performance evaluation mechanism
        performance = random.uniform(0.0, 1.0)
        logging.info(f"Evaluated performance: {performance}")
        return performance
    
    def recursive_improvement(self):
        logging.info("Beginning recursive improvement process.")
        # Base case: Stop improving if performance is above a certain threshold
        current_performance = self.evaluate_performance()
        if current_performance > 0.95:
            logging.info(f"Target performance achieved: {current_performance}")
            return current_performance
        
        # Recursive step: Attempt to improve performance
        # In a real scenario, this would involve actual learning strategies like model tuning
        updated_agent = copy.deepcopy(self)  # simulate improvements by copying and modifying
        updated_agent.learning_rate += self.learning_rate * random.uniform(0.0, 0.1)
        improved_performance = updated_agent.evaluate_performance()
        
        # Recursive call if performance is not satisfactory
        if improved_performance <= current_performance:
            logging.info(f"No improvement found, backtracking...")
            return self.recursive_improvement()
        
        self.performance_metrics[improved_performance] = updated_agent
        logging.info(f"Improvement found: {improved_performance} with learning rate: {updated_agent.learning_rate}")
        
        return improved_performance
    
    def self_diagnose(self):
        # Simple logging based diagnostics
        logging.info("Performing self-diagnostics...")
        logging.info(f"Current learning rate: {self.learning_rate}")
        logging.info(f"Previous metrics: {self.performance_metrics}")
        
    def optimize(self):
        # Optimization loop that mimics autonomous tuning of parameters
        logging.info("Starting optimization cycle.")
        self.self_diagnose()
        self.recursive_improvement()

def run_autonomy_expander():
    agent = SelfEvolvingAgent()
    
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
        future_results = [executor.submit(agent.optimize) for _ in range(2)]
        for future in future_results:
            result = future.result()
            logging.info(f"Optimization result: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.info("Launching PTM autonomy expander module.")
    run_autonomy_expander()
```

### Explanation
- **SelfEvolvingAgent**: Central class that handles recursive strategy execution, performance evaluation, and optimization.
- **Logging**: Utilized for diagnostics and process tracking.
- **Recursive Improvement**: Key feature enabling the agent to continuously self-improve until it reaches the desired performance level.
- **Multithreading with ThreadPoolExecutor**: Allows parallel execution of recursive improvements.
- **Diagnostics**: Logs the agent's internal state and performance metrics to inform future decisions.

### Future Directions
- **Enhance Recursive Algorithms**: Implement more advanced recursive algorithms like genetic programming or reinforcement learning.
- **Advanced Diagnostics**: Integrate AI/ML models to predict and explain system behaviors.
- **Adaptive Learning Rates**: Develop a mechanism for dynamically adjusting the learning rate based on past performances.

Integrating this module into the existing PTM stack would involve tweaking its connections and ensuring it aligns with the overarching architecture and objectives of the PTM empire's system.
