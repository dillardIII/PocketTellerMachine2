Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a Pathfinding and Task Management) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires addressing several complex components. Here, we'll outline a conceptual approach with some code examples that could be part of such a module. The focus will be on innovative recursive strategies combined with machine learning and adaptive algorithms.

### Conceptual Overview

The module will include the following components:

1. **Self-Learning Recursive Strategies**: Implement algorithms that can recursively improve upon themselves based on environmental feedback.
2. **Adaptive Pathfinding**: Use pathfinding algorithms with reinforcement learning to adapt to new environments.
3. **Task Management with AI**: Dynamic prioritization and execution of tasks based on evolving goals and environmental conditions.
4. **Data-Driven Evolution**: Use of neural networks to analyze performance data and adjust strategies.
5. **API for Integration**: Ensure the module can easily integrate with existing systems in the PTM empire.

### Key Components

#### 1. Self-Learning Recursive Algorithms

Implement a recursive function that self-optimizes:

```python
import random

class RecursiveOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, initial_strategy):
        self.strategy = initial_strategy
    
    def evaluate_performance(self):
        # Placeholder for a complex performance evaluation logic
        return random.uniform(0, 1)

    def recursive_improve(self, depth=0, max_depth=5):
        if depth >= max_depth:
            return self.strategy
        
        current_performance = self.evaluate_performance()
        new_strategy = self.modify_strategy(self.strategy)
        
        self.strategy = new_strategy if current_performance < self.evaluate_performance() else self.strategy
        return self.recursive_improve(depth + 1, max_depth)
    
    def modify_strategy(self, strategy):
        # Algorithmic modification of the strategy
        return strategy * random.uniform(0.9, 1.1)
```

#### 2. Adaptive Pathfinding

```python
import networkx as nx

class AdaptivePathfinder:
    def __init__(self, graph):
        self.graph = nx.Graph(graph)
        self.policy_network = self.initialize_policy_network()
    
    def initialize_policy_network(self):
        # A stub for actual neural network initialization
        return
    
    def find_adaptive_path(self, start, goal):
        # Use BFS/DFS as baseline, integrated with RL policy updates
        path = nx.shortest_path(self.graph, source=start, target=goal)
        return path
    
    def adapt(self, feedback):
        # Feedback-driven updates to the policy network
        pass
```

#### 3. Task Management

```python
class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []
        self.priorities = {}
    
    def add_task(self, task, priority):
        self.tasks.append(task)
        self.priorities[task] = priority
    
    def execute_tasks(self):
        # Sort and execute tasks based on priority
        prioritized_tasks = sorted(self.tasks, key=lambda task: self.priorities[task])
        for task in prioritized_tasks:
            self.execute_task(task)
    
    def execute_task(self, task):
        # Placeholder for task execution logic
        print(f"Executing {task}")
```

### Integration & Expansion

The module should come with API endpoints or function calls that allow seamless integration with PTM's existing technologies, potentially offering endpoints to feed back data that can further be used for self-improvement.

### Future Enhancements

- **Neural Network Training**: Implement a deep learning model for dynamic pathfinding and decision-making based on historical data.
- **Decentralized Decision Making**: Integrate decentralized algorithms for autonomous functioning of multiple agents.
- **Interactive Machine Learning**: Incorporate an interactive component where human oversight can adjust algorithms in response to rare or unforeseen situations.

This conceptual design provides a foundation for a Python module aimed at enhancing the self-evolving capabilities of the PTM empire, emphasizing recursive strategies and adaptive learning. Developing these components would involve iterative testing and refinement to ensure efficacy in real-world applications.
