Creating a Python module to expand an autonomous system like the PTM (Predictive Text Models) empire with self-evolving capabilities can be a complex task. Here, I'll provide a high-level design and implementation strategy for a module that incorporates innovative recursive strategies.

### Module Overview

This module will focus on three primary components:
1. **Self-Monitoring**: Continuously assess performance and identify areas for improvement.
2. **Recursive Self-Modification**: Utilize recursive algorithms to enable self-improvement.
3. **Adaptative Learning**: Adjust learning strategies based on new data and feedback.

### Design Components

#### 1. Self-Monitoring

- **Performance Metrics**: Track key performance indicators like model accuracy, response time, and resource usage.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify deviations from expected behavior using statistical and machine learning methods.

#### 2. Recursive Self-Modification

- **Genetic Algorithms**: Implement genetic algorithms to iteratively propose and test variations in model architecture or parameters.
- **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**: Use NAS techniques to optimize and modify model layers and connections.
- **Feedback Loops**: Integrate feedback loops to apply learned improvements back into the system.
  
#### 3. Adaptive Learning

- **Curriculum Learning**: Dynamically adjust the complexity of input data based on model proficiency.
- **Data Augmentation**: Generate synthetic variations of current data to expand learning opportunities.
- **Transfer Learning**: Leverage pre-trained models and selectively adjust parameters to adapt to new tasks.

### High-level Implementation

```python
# File: self_evolving_module.py
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from evolutionary_algorithms import GeneticAlgorithm
from nas_algorithms import NeuralArchitectureSearch

class SelfEvolvingModel:
    def __init__(self, base_model):
        self.model = base_model
        self.performance_history = []

    def self_monitor(self, validation_data):
        predictions = self.model.predict(validation_data)
        performance = accuracy_score(validation_data.labels, predictions)
        self.performance_history.append(performance)
        if len(self.performance_history) >= 2:
            improvement = self.performance_history[-1] - self.performance_history[-2]
            if improvement < 0.01:  # Example threshold
                self.initiate_self_modification()

    def initiate_self_modification(self):
        ga = GeneticAlgorithm(self.model)
        nas = NeuralArchitectureSearch(self.model)
        
        # Choose a strategy based on current state
        if np.random.rand() > 0.5:
            self.model = ga.evolve()
        else:
            self.model = nas.search()

    def adaptative_learning(self, data_generator):
        history = self.model.fit(data_generator)
        if max(history.history['accuracy']) > 0.95:
            self.initiate_self_modification()

    def run_cycle(self, train_data, val_data):
        self.model.fit(train_data)
        self.self_monitor(val_data)
        self.adaptative_learning(train_data)

# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    train_data = ...  # Prepare training data
    val_data = ...    # Prepare validation data
    initial_model = ...  # Some predefined TensorFlow model

    se_model = SelfEvolvingModel(initial_model)
    while True:
        se_model.run_cycle(train_data, val_data)
```

### Considerations

- **Scalability**: Ensure that recursive and evolutionary strategies are efficient and can scale with increasing data and model complexity.
- **Resource Management**: Balance between updating the model and operational costs (e.g., computation power, memory usage).
- **Ethical Considerations**: Incorporate fairness and bias checks to prevent systemic errors and biases.
  
This module can serve as a framework to improve PTM capabilities autonomously. Further refinements may involve introducing more sophisticated AI strategies and distributed computing to enhance its efficiency and reliability.
