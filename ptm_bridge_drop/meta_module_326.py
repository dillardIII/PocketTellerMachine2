Designing a Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably something like a "Pretend Transformation Mech") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating advanced machine learning, autonomous decision-making capabilities, and recursive strategies that enhance the system's adaptability and evolution over time. Below is an outline of an innovative Python module designed for this purpose. The structure will include strategies like reinforcement learning, neural network evolution, and recursive self-improvement.

```python
# ptm_autonomy.py

import numpy as np
import random
import copy

class PTMAutonomy:
    def __init__(self, initial_state, agent):
        self.state = initial_state
        self.agent = agent
        self.history = []
        
    def run_simulation(self, episodes=1000):
        for episode in range(episodes):
            current_state = self.state
            done = False
            while not done:
                action = self.agent.select_action(current_state)
                next_state, reward, done = self.environment_step(current_state, action)
                self.agent.learn(current_state, action, reward, next_state, done)
                current_state = next_state
                self.history.append((current_state, action, reward))
            self.evolve_agent()
    
    def environment_step(self, state, action):
        # Placeholder for environment logic
        next_state = state + np.random.randn(state.shape) * 0.1 
        reward = np.random.rand()
        done = np.random.rand() > 0.9
        return next_state, reward, done
    
    def evolve_agent(self):
        if len(self.history) > 10:  # simple condition for evolution
            self.agent.evolve()

class ReinforcementLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, action_space, learning_rate=0.01, discount_factor=0.99):
        self.action_space = action_space
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.discount_factor = discount_factor
        self.q_table = {}

    def select_action(self, state):
        if state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[state] = np.zeros(self.action_space)
        return np.argmax(self.q_table[state] + np.random.randn(1, self.action_space) * (1. / (1. + len(self.q_table[state]))))
    
    def learn(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        if state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[state] = np.zeros(self.action_space)
        q_update = reward + self.discount_factor * np.max(self.q_table.get(next_state, np.zeros(self.action_space))) * (1 - done)
        self.q_table[state][action] = (1 - self.learning_rate) * self.q_table[state][action] + self.learning_rate * q_update
    
    def evolve(self):
        # Placeholder for evolution algorithm
        print("Evolving agent...")
        # Evolution logic could involve neural architecture search, parameter tuning, etc.

class NeuralRecursiveAgent(ReinforcementLearningAgent):
    def __init__(self, action_space, model, learning_rate=0.01, discount_factor=0.99):
        super().__init__(action_space, learning_rate, discount_factor)
        self.model = model 

    def select_action(self, state):
        q_values = self.model.predict(state)
        return np.argmax(q_values)
    
    def evolve(self):
        super().evolve()
        self.model.recurse()
        # Further recursive self-improvement techniques could be applied here.

class ExampleNeuralModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.weights = np.random.rand(10, 10)
    
    def predict(self, state):
        return np.dot(state, self.weights)
    
    def recurse(self):
        # Example recursive strategy: evolve weights through random mutations
        mutation_strength = 0.1
        new_weights = self.weights + np.random.normal(0, mutation_strength, self.weights.shape)
        self.weights = new_weights

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    initial_state = np.zeros((1, 10))
    model = ExampleNeuralModel()
    agent = NeuralRecursiveAgent(action_space=10, model=model)
    ptm = PTMAutonomy(initial_state, agent)

    ptm.run_simulation()
```

### Key Features:

1. **Reinforcement Learning Agent**: Implements basic Q-learning algorithm for decision-making.

2. **Neural Recursive Agent**: Extends the reinforcement learning agent, integrating a simple neural model that can recursively improve its parameters.

3. **Recursive Evolution**: Incorporates mechanisms for the agent to evolve over time by updating its strategies and neural model weights.

4. **Environment Simulation**: A placeholder for the actual PTM environment, it provides state transitions and rewards for agent actions.

5. **Modularity**: The module is designed to allow for easy extension and integration of more sophisticated models and recursive strategies.

This design provides a foundation for a self-evolving autonomy stack capable of adapting and improving autonomously over time, an essential attribute for expanding the PTM empire.
