Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably, "Prime Tech MegaCorp" for this context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating an architecture that supports self-improvement through recursive strategies. Below is a conceptual outline and some code to illustrate how you might begin to implement this.

### Key Features to Consider

1. **Modular AI Components**: Build an architecture with interchangeable and upgradable components.
2. **Recursive Learning Mechanisms**: Implement self-improvement loops where the system evaluates its performance and integrates improvements.
3. **Dynamic Configuration**: Allow the system to reconfigure itself in response to the environment or task changes.
4. **Feedback Systems**: Use a feedback loop to capture the success or failure of specific strategies and learn from them.

```

### Code Example

Below is a simplified Python module to illustrate a part of this system, focusing on recursive learning and feedback.

```python
import random

class PTMAutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self, modules):
        self.modules = modules
        self.performance_data = []

    def execute(self):
        for module in self.modules:
            result = module.run()
            self.performance_data.append((module, result))

    def evaluate_performance(self):
        # Evaluate collective module performance
        success_rate = sum(result['success'] for _, result in self.performance_data) / len(self.performance_data)
        print(f"Current success rate: {success_rate:.2f}")

    def integrate_improvements(self):
        # An oversimplified example of self-improvement:
        for module in self.modules:
            if random.random() > 0.5:  # Randomly decide to evolve
                module.evolve()

    def feedback_loop(self):
        self.execute()
        self.evaluate_performance()
        self.integrate_improvements()

class Module:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def run(self):
        # Randomly determine if the module's task succeeds or fails
        success = random.random() > 0.5
        return {'success': success}

    def evolve(self):
        print(f"Module {self.name} is evolving...")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    module_list = [Module(name=f"Module#{i}") for i in range(5)]
    autonomy_stack = PTMAutonomyStack(module_list)
    
    for cycle in range(3):  # Run three feedback cycles
        print(f"\nFeedback Cycle {cycle + 1}")
        autonomy_stack.feedback_loop()
```

### Explanation

- **PTMAutonomyStack**: Manages the execution of modules, evaluates their performance, and integrates improvements through a feedback loop.
- **Module**: Represents individual components of the stack that can run tasks and potentially evolve based on external prompts and internal logic.
- **Feedback Loop**: Automates the process of task execution, performance evaluation, and improvement integration.

### Considerations for Expansion

- **Advanced Learning**: Incorporate reinforcement learning (RL), genetic algorithms, or federated learning as enhancement strategies.
- **Data Collection**: Expand feedback mechanisms to collect more data from real-world scenarios.
- **Inter-module Communication**: Develop interfaces for modules to share insights and improvements with others dynamically.
- **Scalability**: Consider scaling the architecture's complexity to include additional sensors, actuators, communication mechanisms, and decision layers.

This foundational example provides a starting point for evolving the PTM's autonomy stack with recursive strategies. The next step would be to integrate this with a more substantial AI/ML framework to handle more complex tasks and environments.
