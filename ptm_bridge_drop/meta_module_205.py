Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical organization or framework) empireâ€™s self-evolving autonomy stack requires thoughtful planning and innovative development. The focus on recursive strategies indicates a need for mechanisms that can iterate and improve over time, integrating machine learning and adaptive systems. Below is an outline for such a module, showcasing how to blend cutting-edge techniques into a cohesive package.

### Module Overview: `PTM_SelfEvolvingAutonomy`

#### Key Components

1. **Adaptive Learning Core**
   - Utilize reinforcement learning algorithms to allow systems to adjust strategies based on received feedback.
   - Implement an experience replay buffer to store interactions and perform batch learning.
  
2. **Recursive Strategy Optimizer**
   - Design recursive functions for decision-making processes that improve with each iteration.
   - Implement genetic algorithms to refine strategies over generations, allowing exploration of diverse approaches.

3. **Neural Network Architectures**
   - Employ meta-learning techniques for networks to adapt learning scenarios.
   - Use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for handling sequential decision-making processes, especially useful in recursive strategies.

4. **Data-Driven Adaptation**
   - Integrate unsupervised learning to recognize patterns and adapt to changing environments autonomously.
   - Leverage clustering algorithms like K-Means or DBSCAN to dynamically segment data for specialized decision pathways.

5. **Autonomy Framework Interface**
   - Provide APIs to integrate with existing PTM systems for seamless expansions.
   - Facilitate data sharing and communication between modules using efficient data serialization formats like Protocol Buffers or Avro.

#### Code Structure
```python
# PTM_SelfEvolvingAutonomy/__init__.py

from .adaptive_learning import AdaptiveLearningCore
from .strategy_optimizer import RecursiveStrategyOptimizer
from .network_architectures import MetaLearningNN
from .data_adaptation import DataDrivenAdaptation
from .framework_interface import AutonomyFrameworkInterface

__all__ = [
    "AdaptiveLearningCore",
    "RecursiveStrategyOptimizer",
    "MetaLearningNN",
    "DataDrivenAdaptation",
    "AutonomyFrameworkInterface"
]

```

#### Example Submodule: Adaptive Learning Core

```python
# PTM_SelfEvolvingAutonomy/adaptive_learning.py

import numpy as np
import random
from collections import deque

class AdaptiveLearningCore:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, learning_rate=0.001, gamma=0.99):
        self.state_size = state_size
        self.action_size = action_size
        self.lr = learning_rate
        self.gamma = gamma
        self.memory = deque(maxlen=2000)
        self.model = self._build_model()

    def _build_model(self):
        # Sample neural network model
        from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
        from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
        model = Sequential([
            Dense(24, input_dim=self.state_size, activation='relu'),
            Dense(24, activation='relu'),
            Dense(self.action_size, activation='linear')
        ])
        model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')
        return model

    def remember(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        self.memory.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))

    def replay(self, batch_size=32):
        minibatch = random.sample(self.memory, min(len(self.memory), batch_size))
        for state, action, reward, next_state, done in minibatch:
            target = (reward + self.gamma * np.amax(self.model.predict(next_state)[0])) if not done else reward
            target_f = self.model.predict(state)
            target_f[0][action] = target
            self.model.fit(state, target_f, epochs=1, verbose=0)

    # Additional methods for adapting through experience and real-time decision-making can be added here.
```

#### Additional Considerations

1. **Scalability and Performance**: Ensure the module efficiently scales across different loads and adapts to resource constraints.
2. **Security**: Implement cybersecurity measures, particularly important for autonomy systems which may operate in sensitive environments.
3. **Testing and Validation**: Set up a testing framework for validating behavior through simulations and hypothetical scenarios.

### Implementation Roadmap

1. **Research and Feasibility Study**: Investigate existing solutions and potential technological constraints. 
2. **Prototyping and Iteration**: Develop initial prototypes and refine based on test results.
3. **Integration and Testing**: Connect the module with existing systems, perform stress tests, and validate performance.
4. **Deployment and Monitoring**: Deploy in a controlled environment, establish monitoring protocols to assess ongoing performance. 

This design combines various advanced concepts in autonomy and adaptability, aiming to foster a system capable of evolving with new challenges and changes.
