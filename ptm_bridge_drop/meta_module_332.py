Designing an innovative Python module to expand PTM (Presumably a conceptual entity for this exercise) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires creating a system that can adapt, learn, and optimize itself over time. Below, I'll outline a conceptual module design using recursive strategies. As this is a high-level design, I'll focus on the architecture and how recursive strategies can be interwoven into the system. 

### Module Name: `AutonomyStack`

#### Key Components

1. **Self-Evolving Core**: This component is responsible for the main operations. It includes subprocesses that can optimize themselves via recursive strategies.
   
2. **Learning Engine**: A component that employs machine learning algorithms to allow the system to adapt based on new data.

3. **Recursive Optimization**: Uses recursive algorithms to iteratively improve decisions and actions.

4. **Feedback Loop Handler**: Continuously collects feedback from operations to optimize and adapt.

5. **Resource Pool**: Manages resources efficiently to avoid bottlenecks, employing adaptive resource allocation strategies.

#### Recursive Strategies

- **Recursive Self-Improvement**: Implement a loop where the system evaluates its performance and adjusts parameters to optimize outcomes.
  
- **Recursive Feature Enhancement**: The system analyses features and recursively enhances them to improve performance.

- **Dynamic Task Division**: Divide tasks into sub-tasks recursively and solve them piece by piece, optimizing each part.

Below is a simple conceptual implementation:

```python
# Module: AutonomyStack.py

import logging
from typing import Any, List, Callable

class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(self.__class__.__name__)
        self.performance_metrics = []
        self.tasks = []
        self.resources = {'cpu': 100, 'memory': 100}

    def recursive_improvement(self, evaluation_function: Callable[[Any], float], parameters: Any):
        # Recursively improve by re-evaluating and adjusting parameters
        performance = evaluation_function(parameters)
        self.performance_metrics.append(performance)
        self.logger.info(f'Current Performance: {performance}')

        # Base condition to halt recursion
        if self.is_optimized(performance):
            return parameters
        
        # Recursive step: Tune parameters and retry
        tuned_parameters = self.tune_parameters(parameters)
        return self.recursive_improvement(evaluation_function, tuned_parameters)

    def tune_parameters(self, parameters: Any) -> Any:
        # Logic to adjust parameters
        # Placeholder: Adjust randomly or by specific heuristic
        adjusted_params = parameters  # This would be a heuristic adjustment
        self.logger.debug(f'Tuned Parameters: {adjusted_params}')
        return adjusted_params
    
    def is_optimized(self, performance: float) -> bool:
        # Define an optimization threshold
        optimized = performance >= 0.95  # Example threshold
        self.logger.debug(f'Optimization Check: {optimized}')
        return optimized

    def dynamic_task_division(self, task: Any, evaluator: Callable[..., float]) -> Any:
        # Recursively divide and conquer tasks
        if self.is_base_task(task):
            return self.process_task(task)

        sub_tasks = self.divide_task(task)
        self.logger.info(f'Divided task into {len(sub_tasks)} sub-tasks.')

        results = [self.dynamic_task_division(sub_task, evaluator) for sub_task in sub_tasks]
        return self.aggregate_results(results)

    def process_task(self, task: Any) -> Any:
        # Process individual base task
        self.logger.debug(f'Processing task: {task}')
        return task  # Placeholder for actual task processing logic

    def is_base_task(self, task: Any) -> bool:
        # Determine if the task is a base task
        return True  # Placeholder

    def divide_task(self, task: Any) -> List[Any]:
        # Logic to divide tasks into smaller sub-tasks
        return [task]  # Placeholder

    def aggregate_results(self, results: List[Any]) -> Any:
        # Logic to aggregate results from divided tasks
        return results  # Placeholder

    def feedback_loop(self, feedback: Any):
        # Process feedback for learning enhancements
        self.logger.info(f'Processing feedback: {feedback}')
        self.learning_engine(feedback)

    def learning_engine(self, data: Any):
        # Machine learning logic to adapt system
        self.logger.debug(f'Learning from data: {data}')
```

### Explanation

- **Recursive Improvement**: This method continuously tunes parameters recursively by evaluating and adjusting until an optimization condition is met.

- **Dynamic Task Division**: We divide tasks into base tasks recursively using divide-and-conquer strategiesâ€”ideal for parallel processing optimizations.

- **Learning Engine & Feedback Loop**: By processing feedback, the learning engine iteratively adapts the operational parameters to better fit evolving environments.

### Closing Thoughts

This module provides a flexible framework, employing recursion and division strategies, for self-evolving systems. Depending on the specific domain and goals of the PTM empire, more concrete implementations can be adapted or expanded to accommodate additional complexity or constraints.
