Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (which I will assume stands for "Pattern-to-Matter") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a focus on several key areas: recursive improvements, adaptability, scalability, and efficient learning algorithms. Below are the conceptual foundations and sample code snippets illustrating how such a module might be constructed, leveraging recursive strategies.

### Conceptual Framework

#### 1. **Recursive Learning and Optimization**
   - Implement recursive neural networks (RNN) or recursive self-improvement (RSI) algorithms to continually enhance the learning model.
   - Utilize evolutionary algorithms to simulate a process by which the model can autonomously adapt and evolve.

#### 2. **Adaptability and Scalability**
   - Ensure the system can operate on various hardware configurations and scale efficiently with increased data.
   - Deploy microservices architecture to handle discrete tasks, allowing parts of the system to evolve independently.

#### 3. **Self-Monitoring and Self-Repair**
   - Integrate diagnostic routines that monitor system performance and autonomously trigger re-training or optimization in case of detected anomalies.

### Sample Python Module

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
from deap import base, creator, tools, algorithms

class AutonomousStack:
    def __init__(self, input_dim, action_dim):
        self.input_dim = input_dim
        self.action_dim = action_dim
        self.model = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(64, 64), max_iter=1, warm_start=True)

    def recursive_train(self, X, y, generations=10):
        # Recursive Self-Improvement via Genetic Algorithm
        def eval_function(individual):
            output = self.model.predict([individual])
            # Objective function to minimize
            return np.sum((output - y) ** 2),
        
        creator.create("FitnessMin", base.Fitness, weights=(-1.0,))
        creator.create("Individual", list, fitness=creator.FitnessMin)
        
        toolbox = base.Toolbox()
        toolbox.register("attribute", np.random.rand)
        toolbox.register("individual", tools.initRepeat, creator.Individual, toolbox.attribute, n=self.input_dim)
        toolbox.register("population", tools.initRepeat, list, toolbox.individual)
        
        toolbox.register("mate", tools.cxTwoPoint)
        toolbox.register("mutate", tools.mutPolynomialBounded, low=0.0, up=1.0, eta=0.1, indpb=0.1)
        toolbox.register("select", tools.selTournament, tournsize=3)
        toolbox.register("evaluate", eval_function)
        
        population = toolbox.population(n=50)
        algorithms.eaSimple(population, toolbox, cxpb=0.5, mutpb=0.2, ngen=generations, verbose=False)
        
        optimal_solution = tools.selBest(population, 1)[0]
        self.model.partial_fit(X, y)

    def adapt_and_scale(self, X_train, y_train):
        # Implement a simplistic check for when to scale
        if len(X_train) > 1000:
            self.model.hidden_layer_sizes = (128, 128)
        self.recursive_train(X_train, y_train)

    def self_diagnose(self, X_test, y_test):
        # Perform diagnostics and potential self-repair
        loss = np.mean((self.model.predict(X_test) - y_test) ** 2)
        if loss > 1.0:
            print("High loss detected, initiating recursive training...")
            self.recursive_train(X_test, y_test)

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    stack = AutonomousStack(input_dim=10, action_dim=1)
    X_train, y_train = np.random.rand(100, 10), np.random.rand(100,)
    X_test, y_test = np.random.rand(20, 10), np.random.rand(20,)

    stack.adapt_and_scale(X_train, y_train)
    stack.self_diagnose(X_test, y_test)
```

### Explanation

- **Recursive Learning:** The `recursive_train` method combines a basic genetic algorithm with a simple neural network model to simulate self-improvement and adaptation.
- **Adaptation:** The `adapt_and_scale` method modifies the model's architecture based on arbitrary conditions (e.g., dataset size).
- **Self-Diagnosis:** The `self_diagnose` method evaluates performance and triggers additional training if necessary.

### Further Considerations

- Integration of more sophisticated learning algorithms and models.
- Expansion of self-repair mechanisms by incorporating anomaly detection beyond simple performance metrics.
- Implementation of decentralized learning strategies (e.g., federated learning) for broader autonomy support.
- Utilizing more advanced state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques for decision-making tasks.
