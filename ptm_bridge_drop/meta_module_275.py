Designing a Python module to expand the PTM empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves several steps. The aim is to create a system that can autonomously improve itself through recursive learning and adaptation. Below is a high-level design outline with some specific implementation details.

### Module Overview

The module, called `AutonomyStack`, is built around the principles of self-improvement and recursive operations. It consists of several components, each responsible for a different aspect of the autonomy stack.

### Key Components

1. **Data Ingestion and Processing**:
    - Use real-time data streams and batch processing for dynamic adaptability.
    - Implement a `DataManager` class for handling inputs.
  
2. **Recursive Learning Engine**:
    - Develop a machine learning core that uses recursive neural networks (RNNs) to model and predict autonomous behaviors.
    - Implement a `RecursiveLearner` class that leverages reinforcement learning for ongoing adaptation.

3. **Self-Evolution Module**:
    - Introduce a meta-learning component capable of generating new learning strategies.
    - Implement a `MetaLearner` class which uses genetic algorithms and neural architecture search (NAS) to find optimal configurations.

4. **Decision-Making System**:
    - Use a hierarchical decision structure for real-time decision-making.
    - Implement a `DecisionMaker` class that utilizes multi-agent systems for distributed decision processes.

5. **Feedback and Improvement Loop**:
    - Establish a continuous feedback loop from real-time operations to the learning engine.
    - Implement a `FeedbackLoop` class that updates models and strategies based on performance evaluations.

6. **Simulation and Testing Environment**:
    - Provide a simulated environment for testing new strategies before deployment.
    - Use an `EnvironmentSimulator` class to model different scenarios.

# Recursive Learner Class
class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def train_model(self, data):

        # Perform neural architecture search
        pass

    def apply_genetic_algorithm(self):
        # Implementation of genetic algorithm for strategy evolution
        pass

# Decision Maker Class
class DecisionMaker():
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def make_decision(self):
        # Implement decision making using hierarchical methods
        pass
        
# Feedback Loop Class
class FeedbackLoop():
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def provide_feedback(self):
        # Logic for performance feedback and model updates
        pass

# Environment Simulator Class
class EnvironmentSimulator():
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def simulate(self):
        # Create realistic scenarios for testing strategies
        pass

# Autonomy Stack Manager
class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_manager = DataManager()
        self.learner = RecursiveLearner()
        self.meta_learner = MetaLearner()
        self.decision_maker = DecisionMaker()
        self.feedback_loop = FeedbackLoop()
        self.simulator = EnvironmentSimulator()
        
    def run(self):
        # Main loop for operation
        pass
        
# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    autonomy_stack = AutonomyStack()
    autonomy_stack.run()
```

### Innovative Strategies

1. **Recursive Neural Networks**: Implementing RNNs ensures the system can handle sequences of events, making it ideal for real-time decision-making.

2. **Genetic Algorithms & NAS**: The combination of these two algorithms in the MetaLearner allows for dynamic discovery of optimal strategies without human intervention.

3. **Continuous Feedback Loop**: By developing an ever-improving feedback system, this module ensures perpetual adaptation and enhancement.

4. **Hierarchical Decision-Making**: This system scales well with complexity and allows localized decision-making within a broader scope.

### Conclusion

This module represents a robust foundation for expanding the PTM empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack. It emphasizes recursive strategies and continual improvement, ensuring that the system adapts to new challenges dynamically and autonomously.
