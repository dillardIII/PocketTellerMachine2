Designing a new Python module for PTM (Presumably a large tech entity like a fictional empire) to expand its self-evolving autonomy stack necessitates a focus on recursive strategies, adaptability, and intelligence amplification. Here’s a conceptual design and rudimentary implementation for such a module, which might be dubbed the "AutoRecursive" module. This module will focus on recursive strategies, allowing systems to adaptively optimize their operations over time.

### Key Features:

1. **Recursive Learning**: Recursive functions for continuous adaptation based on feedback.
2. **Self-Optimization**: Mechanisms for dynamically optimizing decision-making processes.
3. **Modularity**: Components that can plug into existing systems easily.
4. **Scalability**: Capable of operating at scale, across numerous devices or input variables.
5. **Cloud Integration**: Seamlessly works with cloud architecture for scalability.

### Implementation Outline

**`recursive_learning.py`**

This module develops recursive algorithms for adaptive learning. Each iteration improves the system's model based on new data and feedback using an auto-tuning mechanism.

```python
class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, model, max_iterations=100):
        self.model = model
        self.iterations = 0
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations

    def adapt(self, data):
        while self.iterations < self.max_iterations:
            prediction = self.model.predict(data)
            feedback_data = self.collect_feedback(prediction)
            self.model.update(feedback_data)
            self.iterations += 1

    def collect_feedback(self, prediction):
        # Implement feedback collection logic
        return feedback_data

```

**`optimization.py`**

This module provides tools for self-optimization based on performance metrics. It dynamically adjusts parameters to enhance efficiency.

```python
class Optimizer:
    def __init__(self, target_function, learning_rate=0.01):
        self.target_function = target_function
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate

    def optimize(self, params):
        gradients = self.compute_gradients(params)
        for param, grad in zip(params, gradients):
            param -= self.learning_rate * grad
        return params

    def compute_gradients(self, params):
        # Compute the gradient of the target function with respect to params
        return gradients
```

**`cloud_integration.py`**

This module enables integration with a cloud platform for scalable computing and data storage.

```python
class CloudConnector:
    def __init__(self, cloud_service):
        self.cloud_service = cloud_service

    def upload_data(self, data):
        self.cloud_service.upload(data)

    def download_data(self, query):
        return self.cloud_service.query(query)

    def compute_on_cloud(self, function, data):
        result = self.cloud_service.run_function(function, data)
        return result
```

**`utils.py`**

Utility functions for handling common tasks, such as logging, data preprocessing, and error handling.

```python
def log(message, level="INFO"):
    print(f"[{level}] {message}")

def preprocess_data(data):
    # Implement data preprocessing logic
    return processed_data
```

### Testing

The `tests/` directory contains unit tests for each module, ensuring components behave as expected.

### README.md

A comprehensive document describing how to install, configure, and use the AutoRecursive module, including examples and API references.

### Deployment

For deployment, the module could be packaged with tools like `setuptools` and published to a private repository for organization-wide distribution.

### Conclusion

The proposed AutoRecursive module is a versatile tool designed to enhance PTM’s autonomy stack by utilizing recursive strategies and self-optimization. Its modular, scalable nature allows for easy integration into complex systems, propelling PTM's technological capabilities forward.
