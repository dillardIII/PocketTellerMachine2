Creating a new Python module for an organization like PTM's self-evolving autonomy stack involves several innovative components. The goal is to incorporate recursive strategies to enhance adaptability and self-improvement over time. Below, I'll outline the key components and a basic implementation strategy for this module.

### Key Components

1. **Recursive Learning Systems**: Leverage recursive algorithms to iteratively improve decision-making processes.
   
2. **Adaptive Neural Networks**: Implement neural networks that can evolve their architectures over time based on performance feedback.

3. **Feedback Loops**: Establish robust feedback systems for continuous learning and adaptation.

4. **Self-Optimization Protocols**: Use genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning strategies for self-tuning of parameters.

5. **Modular Architecture**: Design the system to be modular, supporting the addition of new functionalities without disrupting existing operations.

6. **Safety and Reliability Layers**: Build fail-safes and monitoring systems to ensure reliability even as the system evolves.

### Module Design

```python
# Filename: ptm_autonomy_stack.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import random

class RecursiveAutonomy:
    def __init__(self, input_dim, initial_layers=[10, 10], mutation_rate=0.1):
        self.input_dim = input_dim
        self.layers = initial_layers
        self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate
        self.network = self._initialize_network(self.layers)
        
    def _initialize_network(self, layers):
        # Initializing a neural network with the given layer structure
        return MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=layers, max_iter=1000)
    
    def train_recursive(self, X, y, iterations=10):
        # Train the network iteratively with recursive improvements
        for i in range(iterations):
            print(f"Iteration {i+1}")
            X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
            self.network.fit(X_train, y_train)
            score = self.network.score(X_test, y_test)
            print(f"Score: {score}")
            
            # Adjust the network based on feedback
            if score < 0.95:  # Example threshold to trigger adaptive changes
                self._evolve_structure()
    
    def _evolve_structure(self):
        # Evolve the architecture of the neural network
        print("Evolving structure...")
        new_layers = []
        for layer in self.layers:
            # Randomly add or remove neurons in each layer based on mutation rate
            if random.random() < self.mutation_rate:
                change = random.choice([-1, 1])
                new_layers.append(max(1, layer + change))
            else:
                new_layers.append(layer)
        
        print(f"New layer structure: {new_layers}")
        self.layers = new_layers
        self.network = self._initialize_network(self.layers)

    def predict(self, X):
        return self.network.predict(X)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Sample data
    X_sample = np.random.rand(100, 5)
    y_sample = np.random.rand(100)

    autonomy_system = RecursiveAutonomy(input_dim=5)
    autonomy_system.train_recursive(X_sample, y_sample, iterations=5)
    predictions = autonomy_system.predict(np.random.rand(10, 5))
    print(f"Predictions: {predictions}")
```

### Additional Considerations

- **Scalability**: Ensure the system can handle increased data loads and incorporate parallel processing when necessary.
  
- **Logging**: Integrate comprehensive logging mechanisms for all training and prediction activities.
  
- **User Interface**: Consider developing a command-line interface or a GUI for easier interaction with the module.

- **Extensibility**: Design the system such that additional functions, models, and feedback mechanisms can be easily integrated.

The recursive and adaptive nature of this module allows PTM's autonomy stack to self-evolve, enhancing robustness over time. Implementing these features requires thorough testing and performance evaluation in diverse scenarios to ensure reliability and safety.
