Designing a new Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably an autonomous systems framework) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies requires careful consideration of key components like adaptability, scalability, recursive learning, and robust data processing. The module needs to foster a high degree of autonomy while allowing the system to evolve based on data and operational feedback. Below is a conceptual design that can serve as a foundation:

### Module Overview: `ptm_auto_evolve`

#### 1. Core Features:
- **Recursive Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implement algorithms that learn and adapt over time by recursively analyzing data, refining models, and updating strategies.
- **Self-Optimization**: Continuously evaluate and improve planning, perception, and decision models to enhance performance over time.
- **Dynamic Data Processing**: Leverage real-time data streams for on-the-fly learning and adaptation.

#### 2. Module Components:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**:
    - Handles real-time data collection from various sensors and external data sources.
    - Pre-processes data for noise reduction and normalization.
    
2. **Recursive Learning Engine**:
    - **Recursive Strategy Manager**: Manages various recursive learning strategies and selects the most effective one based on the current context.
    - **Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs)** or **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks for sequence prediction and handling time-series data.
    - **Automatic Feature Selection**: Identifies which features are most relevant for learning tasks and continuously updates this selection.

3. **Autonomy Stack**:
    - **Perception Module**: Uses recursive strategies to improve accuracy in object detection and environmental mapping.
    - **Decision Module**: Implements decision-making algorithms that evolve and adapt based on historical decisions and outcomes.
    - **Control Module**: Adapts control strategies for optimized navigation and task execution.

4. **Feedback Loop Mechanism**:
    - Implements closed-loop feedback systems for continuous performance monitoring and metric evaluation.
    - Provides self-assessment capabilities, allowing the system to recalibrate algorithms and models based on feedback.

5. **Evolutionary Algorithms**:
    - Use genetic algorithms or other evolutionary strategies to explore a variety of solutions and adapt to new challenges autonomously.
    - Enable self-engineering capabilities so the system can modify its architecture for better efficiency.

6. **Scalability and Adaptation Interfaces**:
    - Provides interfaces that allow the integration of new sensors or data sources without major overhauls.
    - Ensures that the system is scalable both computationally and in terms of functionality.

#### 3. Pseudocode Example:

```python
class PTMAutoEvolve:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_ingestion_layer = DataIngestionLayer()
        self.recursive_learning_engine = RecursiveLearningEngine()
        self.autonomy_stack = AutonomyStack()
        self.feedback_loop_mechanism = FeedbackLoopMechanism()
        self.evolutionary_algorithms = EvolutionaryAlgorithms()

    def run(self):
        while True:
            data = self.data_ingestion_layer.collect_data()
            features = self.recursive_learning_engine.extract_features(data)
            decisions = self.autonomy_stack.make_decision(features)
            self.autonomy_stack.execute_control(decisions)
            self.feedback_loop_mechanism.evaluate_and_learn(decisions)

class RecursiveLearningEngine:
    def extract_features(self, data):
        # Apply recursive processing
        features = self.apply_recursive_algorithms(data)
        return features

    def apply_recursive_algorithms(self, data):
        # Example: Recursive Feature Elimination, RNNs
        pass

class FeedbackLoopMechanism:
    def evaluate_and_learn(self, decisions):
        # Evaluate decision outcomes
        # Adjust models and strategies accordingly
        pass

# Main execution
ptm_auto_evolve = PTMAutoEvolve()
ptm_auto_evolve.run()
```

### Implementation Considerations:
- **Performance**: Ensure the module is optimized for real-time processing and learning.
- **Robustness**: Implement fail-safes and error-handling for edge cases.
- **Security and Privacy**: Protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with regulations.

### Conclusion:
The `ptm_auto_evolve` module outlined here incorporates cutting-edge recursive strategies to develop a highly autonomous and self-evolving system. This design is aimed at enhancing the PTM empireâ€™s capability to adapt and scale intelligently and effectively in complex, dynamic environments.
