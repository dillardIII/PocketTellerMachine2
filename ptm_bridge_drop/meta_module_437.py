Creating a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably Proactive Technological Management) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating advanced recursive strategies and self-improving mechanisms. Here, I'll outline a high-level design for such a module, keeping in mind robust architecture, flexibility, and scalability:

### Module Name
`ptm_autonomy_evolver`

### Key Features

1. **Recursive Learning Systems**:
    - Implement recursive algorithms that refine algorithms by iteratively improving them based on feedback loops.
    - Use recursive neural networks (RNNs) or recursive neuro-symbolic models to enhance predictive capabilities.

2. **Self-Optimization**:
    - Leverage genetic algorithms or evolutionary strategies to evolve algorithms over time.
    - Implement a strategy to explore algorithm hyperparameter space to optimize performance automatically.

3. **Feedback Integration**:
    - Build mechanisms to collect feedback from operations and adjust models dynamically.
    - Use active learning to label new data efficiently and improve the model with less human intervention.

4. **Meta-Learning**:
    - Incorporate meta-learning to allow models to learn new tasks quickly with minimal training data.
    - Develop strategies for transferring learning across different domains.

5. **Self-Diagnostics and Repair**:
    - Create subsystems that can diagnose and repair models in case of failure autonomously.
    - Use anomaly detection to identify when models behave unexpectedly and trigger self-correction routines.

6. **Scalable Microservices Architecture**:
    - Design the module as a set of microservices to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of updates.
    - Implement containerized environments using Docker for easy deployment and scaling.

7. **Security and Privacy**:
    - Ensure data privacy and security with encrypted data channels and privacy-preserving machine learning techniques like federated learning or differential privacy.

### Implementation Details

```python
# ptm_autonomy_evolver/__init__.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from evolutionary_strategies import ES_Optimizer

class AutonomyEvolver:
    def __init__(self, base_algorithm, data, labels):
        self.base_algorithm = base_algorithm
        self.data = data
        self.labels = labels
        self.model = self.initialize_model()

    def initialize_model(self):
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(self.data, self.labels, test_size=0.2)
        model = self.base_algorithm.fit(X_train, y_train)
        self.evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)
        return model

    def evaluate_model(self, model, X_test, y_test):
        predictions = model.predict(X_test)
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
        print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")
        return accuracy

    def recursive_optimize(self, generations=10):
        optimizer = ES_Optimizer(model=self.model, generations=generations)
        best_model = optimizer.evolve(self.data, self.labels)
        return best_model

    def self_diagnose_and_repair(self):
        # Implement anomaly detection and repair procedures
        pass

# Mock implementation of an evolutionary strategy optimizer
class ES_Optimizer:
    def __init__(self, model, generations):
        self.model = model
        self.generations = generations

    def evolve(self, data, labels):
        # Evolve the model using a genetic algorithm or similar
        print("Evolving model...")
        # Evolving logic here
        return self.model

def main():
    # Example data
    data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    labels = np.random.randint(2, size=100)

    # Base algorithm example
    base_algorithm = MLPClassifier()

    evolver = AutonomyEvolver(base_algorithm, data, labels)
    best_model = evolver.recursive_optimize()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Deployment

- **Containerization**: Package the module using Docker, creating an image that can be deployed across various environments.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automatically test and deploy updates.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement robust logging and monitoring frameworks, such as Prometheus and Grafana, to track module performance and failures.

### Conclusion

The `ptm_autonomy_evolver` module aims to provide a foundational architecture for ongoing improvement and evolution of autonomous systems using sophisticated recursive strategies. By integrating self-optimization, meta-learning, and robust feedback mechanisms, this module positions the PTM empire for unparalleled growth in the field of autonomy.
