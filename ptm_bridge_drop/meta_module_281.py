Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a company or project name) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a thorough understanding of both the specific goals of the PTM and the current state of autonomous systems and machine learning. Below is a conceptual framework of such a module, utilizing recursive strategies, that can be adapted to various autonomous tasks such as decision making, path planning, or even adaptive learning. This proposal will emphasize modularity, scalability, and self-evolution capabilities.

### Module Overview

The proposed module is named `ptm_autonomy`. It will be structured to support recursive strategic planning and decision-making processes. It should be flexible enough to be applied to different domains, but customizable for PTM's specific needs.

#### Key Components

1. **Self-Reflective Learning Engine**
   - **Recursive Learning**: Implement a system where the model continuously refines itself by evaluating past decisions and their outcomes. It uses a variation of reinforcement learning with a focus on recursive optimization.
   - **Neural Archival System**: Stores previous states and decisions in a way that allows the model to "reflect" on its past actions and outcomes for self-improvement.

2. **Autonomous Decision Framework**
   - **Recursive Decision Trees (RDT)**: A novel approach to decision-making involving nested decision trees. Each leaf node can recursively become the root of another decision tree, allowing complex decision pathways to be modeled efficiently.
   - **Dynamic Feedback Loops**: Integrate feedback mechanisms that dynamically alter the decision-making path based on real-time data and outcomes, utilizing elements of control theory.

3. **Adaptive Path Planning**
   - Implement a recursive form of RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) that can adapt paths based on evolving environmental data and internal assessments of success likelihood.
   - **Hybrid Path Strategies**: Combine traditional A* strategies with recursive neural evaluations to balance optimality and computational efficiency.

4. **Collaborative Multimodal Interface**
   - **Recursive Communication Protocols**: Design a system where autonomous agents share recursive insights, allowing swarm-like behavior. Agents recursively request and provide information creating a distributed form of knowledge appraisal.
   - **Heterogeneous Agent Systems**: Support a wide range of agent types, allowing for specialized units working under a unified recursive strategy for collaborative tasks.

#### Recursive Strategies

- **Hierarchical Recursive Models (HRM)**
  - Each model comprises sub-models that can operate independently or in a synergy to evaluate their specific niches. These sub-models continuously refine not only their outputs but can propose changes to the overarching model they contribute to.

- **Recursive Simulation for Scenario Testing**
  - Use Monte Carlo methods wrapped in a recursive architecture to simulate wide-ranging scenarios, helping the system understand potential risks and rewards at multiple levels of autonomy.

- **Recursive Reward Structuring**
  - Design reward hierarchies that allow the system to attribute value not just to immediate objectives but to long-term strategies, supporting self-evolving purposes.

### Sample Code Skeleton

```python
# ptm_autonomy/__init__.py

class SelfReflectiveLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []

    def learn(self, state, action, result):
        self.history.append((state, action, result))
        self.optimize_strategy()

    def optimize_strategy(self):
        # Implement Recursive Learning logic here
        pass


class RecursiveDecisionTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = {}

    def decide(self, state):
        # Recursive logic to make a decision
        pass

    def grow_tree(self, evaluation):
        # Add new branches based on evaluations
        pass


class AdaptivePathPlanner:
    def plan(self, start, goal):
        # Implement recursive RRT logic here
        return []

    def adapt(self, environmental_feedback):
        # Adjust paths dynamically
        pass


class CommunicationProtocol:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agent_state = {}

    def exchange_data(self, agent_id, data):
        # Recursive data sharing logic
        self.agent_state[agent_id] = data

# Additional modules and helper functions would be defined here...
```

### Conclusion

These components and strategies form the blueprint of a module designed to expand the PTM empire's autonomy stack using innovative recursive strategies. This design is modular and can be expanded or adapted to accommodate the evolving needs of autonomous systems. The recursive strategies ensure the system remains adaptable, learning from each cycle and thus moving towards true self-evolution.
