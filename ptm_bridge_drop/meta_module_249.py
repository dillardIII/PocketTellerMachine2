Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably for "Proactive Technological Mechanisms") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that leverages recursive strategies, machine learning, and adaptive algorithms to enable autonomous evolution and improvement over time. Here's a conceptual blueprint for such a module:

### Module Overview

The module, named `AutonomyStack`, will consist of components responsible for self-assessment, recursive improvement, decision-making, and knowledge integration. Each component will work cohesively to enhance the autonomy stack's ability to evolve and adapt to new challenges.

### Key Components

1. **Self-Assessment Engine (`SelfAssess`)**
   - Continuously evaluates the performance of various subsystems.
   - Implements recursive feedback loops to gather insights.
   - Utilizes anomaly detection to identify areas needing improvement.

2. **Recursive Improvement Module (`RecursiveImprove`)**
   - Uses insights from the Self-Assessment Engine.
   - Applies machine learning techniques like reinforcement learning to explore potential improvements.
   - Incorporates evolutionary algorithms to simulate mutation, crossover, and selection processes for improving algorithms.

3. **Decision-Making Core (`DecisionCore`)**
   - Analyzes data from the environment.
   - Leverages deep learning models to make predictions and inform decisions.
   - Integrates fuzzy logic to handle uncertain or ambiguous data.

4. **Knowledge Integration System (`KnowledgeIntegrator`)**
   - Connects the autonomy stack with external data sources.
   - Employs natural language processing (NLP) to contextualize and integrate knowledge.
   - Updates internal ontologies for more relevant decision-making.

5. **Resilience Network (`ResilienceNet`)**
   - Provides redundancy and fault tolerance.
   - Uses a distributed ledger (e.g., blockchain) for secure, immutable logging of changes and updates.
   - Predicts potential failures and adapts strategies to mitigate risk.

### Recursive Strategy Implementation

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import logging
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Basic setup for logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class SelfAssess:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []

    def evaluate(self, data):
        performance = np.mean(data)  # Simplified example
        self.history.append(performance)
        logging.info(f"Current performance: {performance}")
        return performance

class RecursiveImprove:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = RandomForestRegressor()

    def improve(self, X, y):
        self.model.fit(X, y)
        logging.info("Model has been improved recursively.")

class DecisionCore:
    def predict(self, X):
        return np.random.choice([0, 1], size=len(X))

class KnowledgeIntegrator:
    def integrate(self, knowledge):
        # Simulate knowledge integration
        logging.info(f"Integrating knowledge: {knowledge}")

class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.self_assess = SelfAssess()
        self.recursive_improve = RecursiveImprove()
        self.decision_core = DecisionCore()
        self.knowledge_integrator = KnowledgeIntegrator()

    def run(self, data, labels):
        performance = self.self_assess.evaluate(data)
        if performance < threshold:
            self.recursive_improve.improve(data, labels)
        decisions = self.decision_core.predict(data)
        return decisions

if __name__ == '__main__':
    stack = AutonomyStack()
    sample_data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    sample_labels = np.random.randint(2, size=(100,))
    decisions = stack.run(sample_data, sample_labels)
    logging.info(f"Decisions made: {decisions}")
```

### Innovative Features

- **Continuous Learning:** The system constantly updates its models and strategies based on new data and changing environments.
- **Cross-Module Communication:** Allows each component to communicate and coordinate effectively.
- **Self-Healing Capabilities:** Autonomously resolves issues as they arise, ensuring minimal downtime.
- **Ethical AI Implementation:** Includes decision-making that adheres to predefined ethical guidelines, ensuring responsible autonomy.

This design provides a robust foundation for an autonomy stack that is self-aware, continuously improving, and capable of integrating new knowledge, making it a valuable asset for expanding the capabilities of the PTM empire.
