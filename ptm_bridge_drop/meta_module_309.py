Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably Transformative Model) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves crafting an architecture that leverages recursive strategies to allow for continual self-improvement and adaptation. We can focus on several core components: self-evaluation, feedback loops, dynamic learning architectures, and automated decision-making capabilities. Below is a high-level design outline, including a brief description of the strategies and potential code structure.

### Module Name: `autonomo`

#### Key Components:

1. **Self-Evaluation Engine**:
   - Evaluates the current performance of models and systems against predefined benchmarks.
   - Utilizes recursive techniques to iteratively improve evaluation accuracy.

2. **Feedback Loop Mechanism**:
   - Implements continuous feedback loops to provide actionable insights.
   - Adapts learning strategies based on past performance data.

3. **Dynamic Learning Architect**:
   - Enables self-modification of model architectures based on recursive evaluation.
   - Utilizes meta-learning to refine learning processes over time.

4. **Automated Decision-Making System**:
   - Integrates decision logic that evolves through recursive learning strategies.
   - Makes autonomous adjustments to task prioritizations and resource allocations.

5. **Recursive Strategy Scheduler**:
   - Manages the scheduling and execution of recursive learning and evaluation strategies.
   - Ensures efficient resource usage and minimizes conflict between different learning modules.

#### Potential Code Structure:

```python
# autonomo/__init__.py

from .self_evaluation import SelfEvaluationEngine
from .feedback_loop import FeedbackLoopMechanism
from .dynamic_learning import DynamicLearningArchitect
from .decision_making import AutomatedDecisionSystem
from .scheduler import RecursiveStrategyScheduler

class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.evaluation_engine = SelfEvaluationEngine()
        self.feedback_loop = FeedbackLoopMechanism()
        self.dynamic_learning = DynamicLearningArchitect()
        self.decision_system = AutomatedDecisionSystem()
        self.scheduler = RecursiveStrategyScheduler()

    def run(self):
        # Integrating components into a cohesive recursive system
        while True:
            performance_metrics = self.evaluation_engine.evaluate()
            self.feedback_loop.process_feedback(performance_metrics)
            self.dynamic_learning.adapt_structure()
            self.decision_system.make_decisions()
            self.scheduler.schedule_next_iteration()

    def stop(self):
        # Logic to gracefully terminate the autonomy stack
        pass
```

#### Individual Components:

1. **SelfEvaluationEngine**:
   - Evaluates model efficacy, logs performance metrics, and suggests initial modifications.
   - Recursively refines its own evaluation criteria.

```python
# autonomo/self_evaluation.py

class SelfEvaluationEngine:
    def evaluate(self):
        # Determine current system performance
        evaluation_metrics = self.compute_metrics()
        self.recursive_refinement(evaluation_metrics)
        return evaluation_metrics

    def compute_metrics(self):
        # Logic to compute performance metrics
        return {}

    def recursive_refinement(self, metrics):
        # Adjust evaluation logic based on previous evaluations
        pass
```

2. **FeedbackLoopMechanism**:
   - Processes feedback to inform system adjustments.
   - Integrates previous experiences to improve feedback quality.

```python
# autonomo/feedback_loop.py

class FeedbackLoopMechanism:
    def process_feedback(self, metrics):
        # Handle feedback and prepare for iterative improvement
        self.recursive_feedback_processing(metrics)

    def recursive_feedback_processing(self, metrics):
        # Enhance feedback mechanisms utilizing past data
        pass
```

3. **DynamicLearningArchitect**:
   - Adapts and evolves model architectures for improved learning capability.
   - Employs meta-learning tactics for recursive improvement.

```python
# autonomo/dynamic_learning.py

class DynamicLearningArchitect:
    def adapt_structure(self):
        # Modify learning architectures based on feedback
        self.recursive_architecture_optimization()

    def recursive_architecture_optimization(self):
        # Utilize recursive strategies for architectural refinements
        pass
```

4. **AutomatedDecisionSystem**:
   - Manages and evolves decision-making logic using recursive patterns.
   - Ideal for prioritizing and allocating computational resources.

```python
# autonomo/decision_making.py

class AutomatedDecisionSystem:
    def make_decisions(self):
        # Make and execute decisions
        self.recursive_decision_optimization()

    def recursive_decision_optimization(self):
        # Improve decision strategies recursively
        pass
```

5. **RecursiveStrategyScheduler**:
   - Schedules recursive evaluations and adaptations.
   - Balances and prioritizes the execution of recursive strategies.

```python
# autonomo/scheduler.py

class RecursiveStrategyScheduler:
    def schedule_next_iteration(self):
        # Schedule new tasks and iterations
        self.optimize_schedule_recursively()

    def optimize_schedule_recursively(self):
        # Recursively optimize the task scheduling
        pass
```

### Considerations:

- **Scalability**: Ensure the module can handle increasing data loads and complexity by optimizing recursion pathways.
- **Robustness**: Design fail-safes and recovery mechanisms for recursive operations to prevent endless loops or system crashes.
- **Integration**: Provide interfaces for easy integration with existing PTM systems and pipelines.

By focusing on recursive strategies, this module aims to continually self-improve and adapt, contributing to the PTM empire's goal of developing highly autonomous and resilient systems.
