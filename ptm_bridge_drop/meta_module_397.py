Designing a Python module for the PTM (Presumably a fictional or project-specific entity) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a well-thought-out architecture that leverages recursive strategies for continuous improvement. Here's a conceptual design and rudimentary implementation to guide you in creating a self-evolving autonomy system:

### Key Components

1. **Recursive Learning Framework**:
    - Implement recursive strategies for learning and decision-making.
    - Utilize feedback loops to continually refine algorithms.

2. **Self-Optimization Engine**:
    - Integrate machine learning algorithms that can optimize themselves.
    - Employ genetic algorithms, neural networks, or reinforcement learning for self-improvement.

3. **Dynamic Environment Interaction**:
    - Capture real-time data to influence decision-making processes.
    - Implement simulations and environment models.

4. **Modular Architecture**:
    - Design with modularity to allow for plug-and-play enhancements.
    - Provide interfaces for new algorithms and strategies easily.

5. **Monitoring and Visualization**:
    - Implement logging and monitoring for performance evaluation.
    - Provide visualization tools for better understanding and interaction with the autonomy stack.

### Sample Python Module

```python
import random
import logging
from typing import List, Any

# Enable logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class SelfEvolvingAutonomy:

    def __init__(self):
        self.current_state = self.initialize_state()
        self.best_state = None
        self.history = []

    def initialize_state(self):
        # Initialize with a random or predefined state
        state = {'parameter1': random.random(), 'parameter2': random.random()}
        logging.info(f"Initial state: {state}")
        return state

    def evaluate_state(self, state: dict) -> float:
        # Example evaluation function (to be replaced with real metric)
        performance = state['parameter1'] * state['parameter2']
        logging.info(f"Evaluating state {state} with performance {performance}")
        return performance

    def evolve(self):
        # Example of a self-optimization loop (could be genetic algorithm, etc.)
        for iteration in range(10):  # Manage recursive depth as needed
            new_state = self.mutate_state(self.current_state)
            new_performance = self.evaluate_state(new_state)
            current_performance = self.evaluate_state(self.current_state)

            if new_performance > current_performance:
                logging.info(f"New better state found: {new_state}")
                self.current_state = new_state

            # Log history
            self.history.append((new_state, new_performance))
            logging.info(f"History updated: {self.history[-1]}")

        # Decide the best state
        self.best_state = max(self.history, key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
        logging.info(f"Best state determined: {self.best_state}")

    def mutate_state(self, state: dict) -> dict:
        # Randomly tweak the state
        new_state = state.copy()
        tweak = random.choice(['parameter1', 'parameter2'])
        change_factor = (random.random() - 0.5) * 0.1
        new_state[tweak] += change_factor
        logging.info(f"Mutated state: {new_state}")
        return new_state

    def run(self):
        logging.info("Running self-evolution process...")
        self.evolve()
        logging.info("Self-evolution process complete.")

# Simulate interaction
autonomy_system = SelfEvolvingAutonomy()
autonomy_system.run()
```

### Explanation

- **Recursive Learning**: The `evolve` method repeatedly evaluates and mutates states in a loop, mimicking recursive self-improvement.
  
- **Self-Optimization**: Using mutation and performance evaluation as a basic form of genetic algorithm for state optimization.

- **Dynamic Environment**: While simple, tweaks in `mutate_state` represent dynamic interactions with the "environment."

- **Modularity**: The design is modular, with clear separation and potential for expansion with additional methods or strategies.

- **Monitoring**: Use of logging provides transparent monitoring of the internal state and evolution process.

### Future Enhancements

- Implement more sophisticated learning algorithms like Reinforcement Learning or Deep Q-Networks.
- Incorporate more complex state representation and transition mechanisms.
- Add interfaces for external data collection and integration with other autonomy stack layers.
- Develop a graphical user interface for better visualization and control.

This module serves as a foundational blueprint for an evolving autonomy stack within an empire-context or similar large-scale system.
