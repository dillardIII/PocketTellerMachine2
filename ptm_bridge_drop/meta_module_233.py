Designing a Python module for a self-evolving autonomy stack is an exciting challenge. Such an architecture could involve recursive strategies that enable the system to adapt and improve itself over time. Below is an outline and implementation strategy for a Python module named `ptm_selfevolve`.

### Module Overview

The `ptm_selfevolve` module aims to enhance the PTM (Presumably Tactical Module) empire by allowing its systems to self-optimize using recursive learning and adaptive algorithms. The foundation of this module is based on the following core components:

1. **Recursive Learning**: Systems that learn from their decisions and outcomes autonomously.
2. **Genetic Algorithms**: Implementing evolution-inspired algorithms for continuous improvement.
3. **Feedback Loops**: Utilizing feedback to adjust strategies and improve performance.
4. **Self-Monitoring**: Constantly assess the module's performance and adapt.
5. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Efficient distribution of computational resources based on current requirements.

### Proposed Design

#### Components

1. **Agent Class**: Core unit representing an autonomous agent.
2. **Environment Class**: Simulated environment for agents to operate and learn in.
3. **EvolutionaryStrategy Class**: Implements genetic algorithm-based optimization.
4. **FeedbackAnalyzer Class**: Analyzes system performance and guides adaptation.
5. **ResourceManager Class**: Allocates resources dynamically to agents.

#### Implementation Strategy

```python
# ptm_selfevolve.py

import random
import numpy as np

# Agent Class
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id
        self.strategy = self.initialize_strategy()
        
    def initialize_strategy(self):
        # Initialize the agent's strategy with random parameters
        return np.random.rand(10)
    
    def make_decision(self, environment):
        # Basic decision-making process using current strategy
        # This is where recursive learning could be integrated
        decision_quality = np.dot(environment.conditions, self.strategy)
        return decision_quality > 0.5

# Environment Class
class Environment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.conditions = self.initialize_conditions()
        
    def initialize_conditions(self):
        # Initialize environmental conditions
        return np.random.rand(10)

# Evolutionary Strategy Class
class EvolutionaryStrategy:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        self.agents = agents

    def evolve(self):
        # Implements a genetic algorithm-based evolution
        for agent in self.agents:
            agent.strategy = self.mutate(agent.strategy)
    
    def mutate(self, strategy):
        # Apply mutation to the agent's strategy
        mutation_rate = 0.1
        new_strategy = strategy + np.random.normal(0, mutation_rate, size=strategy.shape)
        return new_strategy

# Feedback Analyzer Class
class FeedbackAnalyzer:
    def analyze_feedback(self, agents, environment):
        # Analyze feedback from agents to improve strategies
        for agent in agents:
            if not agent.make_decision(environment):
                agent.strategy = agent.strategy * 0.9  # Example of strategy dampening

# Resource Manager Class
class ResourceManager:
    def allocate_resources(self, agents):
        # Allocate computational resources dynamically
        # Prioritize agents with better strategies
        sorted_agents = sorted(agents, key=lambda x: np.sum(x.strategy), reverse=True)
        for priority, agent in enumerate(sorted_agents):
            # Example allocation strategy based on priority
            agent.resources = 100 / (priority + 1)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agents = [Agent(id=i) for i in range(10)]
    environment = Environment()
    es = EvolutionaryStrategy(agents)
    fa = FeedbackAnalyzer()
    rm = ResourceManager()
    
    for epoch in range(100):  # Simulate over 100 epochs
        for agent in agents:
            agent.make_decision(environment)
        
        es.evolve()
        fa.analyze_feedback(agents, environment)
        rm.allocate_resources(agents)
```

### Explanation

- **Recursive Learning** is conceptual; real-world implementation would require data persistence and revision of agent strategies based on multiple timesteps of evolution.
- **Evolutionary Strategies** are utilized to refine agents' decision-making algorithms over time.
- **Feedback Loops** adjust strategies based on environment interactions, using reward/punishment mechanisms.
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation** ensures efficient use of resources by prioritizing more successful agents.

This module is highly extensible and can integrate with advanced machine learning and data-driven techniques to further improve autonomy. Additional features, such as real-time data ingestion and smart scheduling, can be added as enhancement layers.
