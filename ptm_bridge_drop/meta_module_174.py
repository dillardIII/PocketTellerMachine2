Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional or context-specific concept) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires defining clear objectives, components, and architecture. Let's focus on a modular design emphasizing autonomous self-improvement using machine learning and recursion strategies.

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Objectives:
1. **Self-Evolution**: Implement algorithms that allow recursive self-improvement.
2. **Scalability**: Ensure the stack can grow with expanding requirements through modular components.
3. **Adaptability**: Allow dynamic adjustment to changing environments or requirements.
4. **Recursive Strategies**: Use recursion in decision-making processes to improve autonomy.

#### Module Components:

##### 1. Data Collection (`data_collector.py`)
- **Purpose**: Gather data from the environment for training and evaluation.
- **Features**:
  - Interfaces with sensors or data sources.
  - Preprocesses data for model consumption.

##### 2. Model Training (`model_trainer.py`)
- **Purpose**: Train models on collected data for specific tasks.
- **Features**:
  - Supports different learning paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning).
  - Implements recursive learning strategies for continual improvement.
  
##### 3. Decision Engine (`decision_engine.py`)
- **Purpose**: Make autonomous decisions based on model predictions and recursive strategies.
- **Features**:
  - Recursively evaluates decisions to optimize outcomes.
  - Implements a priority queue for decision-making with fallback mechanisms.

##### 4. Self-Improvement Engine (`self_improvement.py`)
- **Purpose**: Enhance learning algorithms and models autonomously.
- **Features**:
  - Monitors model performance and triggers optimization or retraining.
  - Uses meta-learning strategies to improve learning processes recursively.

##### 5. Communication Layer (`communication.py`)
- **Purpose**: Handle the interaction between different modules and external systems.
- **Features**:
  - Manages data flow between components.
  - Ensures secure and efficient communication across the stack.

#### Innovative Recursive Strategies:

- **Recursive Model Training**:
  - Implement recursive neural networks (RNNs) or Transformer models to handle sequential decisions and improvements.

- **Self-Reflective Loop**:
  - Periodically assesses decision effectiveness and adapts strategies based on historical successes/failures.

- **Hierarchical Autonomy**:
  - Break the decision process into hierarchical and recursive levels, allowing complex problem solving by decomposing problems into sub-problems.

- **Feedback-Loop Learning**:
  - Continuously updates model parameters and decision protocols based on feedback loops from previous actions.

#### Example Code Skeleton:

```python
# ptm_autonomy/__init__.py
from .data_collector import DataCollector
from .model_trainer import ModelTrainer
from .decision_engine import DecisionEngine
from .self_improvement import SelfImprovement

__all__ = ['DataCollector', 'ModelTrainer', 'DecisionEngine', 'SelfImprovement']

# ptm_autonomy/data_collector.py
class DataCollector:
    def collect_data(self):
        # Collect and preprocess data
        pass

# ptm_autonomy/model_trainer.py
class ModelTrainer:
    def train_model(self, data):
        # Train model with recursive strategies
        pass

# ptm_autonomy/decision_engine.py
class DecisionEngine:
    def make_decision(self, model_output):
        # Recursive decision-making process
        pass

# ptm_autonomy/self_improvement.py
class SelfImprovement:
    def enhance_learning(self):
        # Meta-strategies for self-improvement
        pass

# ptm_autonomy/communication.py
class Communication:
    def exchange_data(self):
        # Handle communication between modules
        pass
```

### Conclusion:

This modular conceptual design for the `ptm_autonomy` Python module aims to empower the PTM empire's autonomy stack with the ability to recursively improve and adapt to change, utilizing cutting-edge strategies. Each component should be implemented with flexibility and interoperability in mind to ensure seamless integration and scaling.
