Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably referring to a hypothetical "PTM Empire's" self-evolving autonomy stack) involves careful consideration of recursive strategies, self-improvement, and adaptability. Below is an outline of a module with innovative recursive strategies, including explanations for each part to help you implement and expand upon it:

```python
# Filename: self_evolving_autonomy.py

import random
import copy

class AutonomousAgent:
    """
    This class represents an autonomous agent capable of recursive self-improvement.
    """

    def __init__(self, capabilities, knowledge_base):
        self.capabilities = capabilities  # Dictionary of capabilities and their efficiency scores
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base  # Initial knowledge-base for the agent
        self.efficiency_threshold = 0.7  # Arbitrary threshold for satisfactory capability performance

    def assess_performance(self):
        """
        Assess the performance of each capability and decide if it requires improvement.
        """
        improvement_needed = {}
        for capability, score in self.capabilities.items():
            if score < self.efficiency_threshold:
                improvement_needed[capability] = score
        return improvement_needed

    def recursive_improvement_strategy(self, improvement_needed):
        """
        Uses recursive strategies to evolve capabilities that need improvement.
        Strategies include:
        - Cross-pollination of ideas from knowledge base
        - Recursive self-testing and optimization
        """
        for capability in improvement_needed.keys():
            # Use cross-pollination of ideas
            related_knowledge = self.knowledge_base_lookup(capability)
            updated_capability = self.optimize_capability(capability, related_knowledge)

            # Recursion: If the capability is still below threshold, retry optimization
            if updated_capability < self.efficiency_threshold:
                self.capabilities[capability] = self.recursive_improvement_strategy({capability: updated_capability})

            print(f"Updated capability '{capability}' to efficiency {self.capabilities[capability]:.2f}")

    def knowledge_base_lookup(self, capability):
        """
        Pulls relevant knowledge for a specific capability from the knowledge base.
        """
        # Implementation detail: Returning random related ideas for simplicity
        return random.sample(self.knowledge_base, k=3)

    def optimize_capability(self, capability, related_knowledge):
        """
        Optimizes a capability using related knowledge and adaptive strategies.
        """
        improvement_factor = sum(random.random() for _ in related_knowledge) / 10
        new_score = min(self.capabilities[capability] + improvement_factor, 1.0)  # Scores capped at 1.0
        self.capabilities[capability] = new_score
        return new_score

    def evolve(self):
        """
        Initiates the evolution process by assessing and improving capabilities.
        """
        improvement_needed = self.assess_performance()
        if improvement_needed:
            self.recursive_improvement_strategy(improvement_needed)
        else:
            print("All capabilities meet the efficiency threshold.")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    capabilities = {
        'navigation': 0.65,
        'decision_making': 0.6,
        'resource_management': 0.8
    }
    
    knowledge_base = [
        'machine_learning_algorithms', 'optimization_techniques', 
        'data_analysis_methods', 'strategic_planning', 'problem_solving_skills'
    ]

    autonomous_agent = AutonomousAgent(capabilities, knowledge_base)
    autonomous_agent.evolve()
```

### Explanation

1. **Recursive Functionality**: The `recursive_improvement_strategy` function is responsible for iteratively and recursively improving capabilities that are below a specified efficiency threshold. If a capability doesn't improve adequately from one iteration, the recursive approach allows further attempts with adaptive learning.

2. **Cross-Pollination of Ideas**: Leverages the knowledge base to draw relevant learning that could improve certain capabilities. This mimics the human-like transfer of learning between related skills.

3. **Performance Assessment and Optimizing**: The `assess_performance` and `optimize_capability` functions work together to identify underperforming areas and utilize a knowledge-based strategy to improve them.

4. **Randomized Learning Elements**: Uses elements of randomness to simulate the unpredictable nature of learning and adaptation that can occur in autonomy.

5. **Adaptability and Scalability**: Designed to be adaptable with varying capabilities and knowledge bases, making it extensible for more complex scenarios based on future expansions.

This would be the foundational framework for a self-evolving autonomy stack in Python, keeping in mind that actual implementation with AI would involve more sophisticated techniques, models, and validation methodologies.
