Designing a new Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical empire dealing with advanced technologies) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack involves leveraging cutting-edge concepts in autonomous systems, machine learning, and software engineering. Here’s a high-level overview and a blueprint of how you might structure and develop such a module, focusing on innovative recursive strategies.

### Overview

The objective is to create a self-evolving autonomy stack that can adapt over time by learning from the environment and previous iterations. This stack will incorporate recursive strategies to refine its functions autonomously.

### Key Components

1. **Core Components:**
   - **Learning Engine:** Employs machine learning models (e.g., neural networks, reinforcement learning agents) that can self-improve.
   - **Environment Interface:** Interacts with the external environment to gather data and apply decisions.
   - **Adaptation Module:** Adjusts parameters and strategies based on feedback from the learning engine.
   - **Recursive Strategy Layer:** Implements recursive approaches for refining the learning processes.

2. **Recursive Strategies:**
   - **Meta-Learning**: The system will incorporate meta-learning to learn how to learn efficiently.
   - **Evolutionary Algorithms:** Utilize genetic algorithms that recursively evolve the solutions to optimize performance.
   - **Self-Reflective Mechanisms:** The system inspects its own decision-making processes, identifying areas of improvement autonomously.

# ptm_autonomy.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from evolutionary_search import EvolutionaryAlgorithm
import logging

# Setup logging for debugging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize core components
        self.learning_engine = self.build_learning_engine()
        self.environment_interface = None
        self.scaler = StandardScaler()

    def build_learning_engine(self):
        # Example: constructing a simple neural network as the learning engine
        model = Sequential([
            Dense(64, input_dim=10, activation='relu'),
            Dense(32, activation='relu'),
            Dense(1, activation='linear')
        ])
        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
        return model

    def gather_data(self):
        # Prepare mock environment interaction
        data, labels = np.random.rand(100, 10), np.random.rand(100, 1)
        return data, labels

    def train(self):
        data, labels = self.gather_data()
        data = self.scaler.fit_transform(data)
        self.learning_engine.fit(data, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=8, verbose=0)
        logging.info("Training completed")

    def adapt(self):
        # Recursive strategy for adaptation
        new_hyperparameters = self.evolutionary_strategy()
        self.learning_engine = self.build_learning_engine_with_hyperparameters(new_hyperparameters)
        
    def evolutionary_strategy(self):
        # Implement a simple evolutionary algorithm to optimize hyperparameters
        ea = EvolutionaryAlgorithm()
        best_hyperparameters = ea.optimize(self.evaluate_fitness)
        logging.debug(f"Evolved Hyperparameters: {best_hyperparameters}")
        return best_hyperparameters

    def build_learning_engine_with_hyperparameters(self, hyperparameters):
        # Rebuild learning engine with new hyperparameters
        model = Sequential([
            Dense(hyperparameters['layer1_nodes'], input_dim=10, activation='relu'),
            Dense(hyperparameters['layer2_nodes'], activation='relu'),
            Dense(1, activation='linear')
        ])
        model.compile(optimizer=hyperparameters['optimizer'], loss='mse')
        return model

    def evaluate_fitness(self, hyperparameters):
        # Evaluation function for the evolutionary algorithm
        self.build_learning_engine_with_hyperparameters(hyperparameters)
        score = self.validate()
        return score

    def validate(self):
        # Validate model - Mock validation process
        validation_score = np.random.rand()
        logging.info(f"Validation Score: {validation_score}")
        return validation_score

    def execute(self):
        # Main execution loop
        self.train()
        self.adapt()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    stack = AutonomyStack()
    stack.execute()
```

### Strategy Explanation

- **Recursive Approach:** This module depth-wise optimizes the solutions via recursion through evolutionary algorithms, which repeatedly refine the parameters and structure of the learning engine.
  
- **Self-Adapting:** The autonomous system assesses its performance and adapts without human intervention, driven by an internal adaptation loop.

- **Interfacing with the Environment:** The system gathers and utilizes real-time data from interactions continuously to learn and adapt.

### Conclusion

This module is conceptual, illustrating a recursive strategy to build a self-evolving autonomy stack. Real-world applications would need these concepts adapted for specific domain requirements and computational capabilities.
