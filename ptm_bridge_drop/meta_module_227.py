Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably an AI-based or autonomous system) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires careful consideration of modularity, scalability, and adaptability. Below is a high-level design outline of the module, incorporating innovative recursive strategies for improving autonomy.

### Module: `self_evolving_autonomy`

#### Key Features:
1. **Recursive Self-Improvement**: Implements strategies for recursive learning and adaptation.
2. **Dynamic Environment Interaction**: Interfaces for dynamic perception and interaction with diverse environments.
3. **Modular Architecture**: Allows for easy integration of new components and technologies.
4. **Scalable Algorithms**: Efficient algorithms that scale with increased data and complexity.
5. **Multilayered Learning**: Combines different learning paradigms for robust performance.

#### Core Components

1. **Environment Interface (`environment.py`)**
   - **Purpose**: Define how the system interacts with dynamic environments.
   - **Key Functions**:
     - `sense()`: Captures real-time data from sensors.
     - `act(action)`: Executes actions in the real world.
     - `simulate()`: Simulates interactions to predict outcomes.

2. **Learning Engine (`learning_engine.py`)**
   - **Purpose**: The heart of the autonomy stack, responsible for learning and decision-making.
   - **Innovations**:
     - **Recursive Learning Pipeline**: Implement a pipeline that revisits past states with new knowledge to improve decisions continuously.
     - `update_knowledge_base(data)`: Integrates new information.
     - `recursive_improve()`: Continuously optimizes decision-making models.

3. **Adaptation Layer (`adaptation_layer.py`)**
   - **Purpose**: Adjusts strategies based on feedback.
   - **Key Functions**:
     - `adjust_strategy(feedback)`: Modifies behavior based on performance feedback.
     - `evolutionary_algorithm()`: Utilizes evolutionary strategies to explore optimizations.

4. **Data Management (`data_manager.py`)**
   - **Purpose**: Manage data inflow and historical recordings.
   - **Key Functions**:
     - `store(data)`: Saves raw and processed data.
     - `retrieve()`: Accesses historical data for analysis.
     - `prune()`: Removes redundant or outdated data intelligently.

5. **Simulation & Testing (`simulation.py`)**
   - **Purpose**: Provides an environment for testing changes and updates safely.
   - **Key Functions**:
     - `run_simulation()` : Tests new strategies in a controlled virtual environment.
     - `evaluate_performance()`: Analyzes performance metrics.

#### Recursive Strategies

- **Self-Reflection**: Incorporate a reflection mechanism that reviews previous decisions and their consequences to refine future actions. This can be a scheduled recursive task that analyzes logs and performance metrics.
- **Dynamic Model Updates**: Periodically, the system should recursively update its prediction models based on new environmental interactions.
- **Incremental Learning**: Implement continuous learning using small data batches, enabling the system to adapt without requiring large-scale retraining.
- **Feedback Loop**: Create a feedback loop that allows components to request and implement adjustments from one another iteratively.

#### Example Code Structure

```python
# environment.py
class Environment:
    def sense(self):
        pass

    def act(self, action):
        pass

    def simulate(self):
        pass

# learning_engine.py
class LearningEngine:
    def update_knowledge_base(self, data):
        pass

    def recursive_improve(self):
        pass

# adaptation_layer.py
class AdaptationLayer:
    def adjust_strategy(self, feedback):
        pass

    def evolutionary_algorithm(self):
        pass

# data_manager.py
class DataManager:
    def store(self, data):
        pass

    def retrieve(self):
        pass

    def prune(self):
        pass

# simulation.py
class Simulation:
    def run_simulation(self):
        pass

    def evaluate_performance(self):
        pass
```

#### Conclusion
This module can form the backbone of a system focused on self-evolving autonomy with recursive strategies to continually adapt and enhance its decision-making in complex environments. Designed with modularity and scalability in mind, it allows for ongoing integration of cutting-edge technologies and methodologies.
