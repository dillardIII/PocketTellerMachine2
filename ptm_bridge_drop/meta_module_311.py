Designing a Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably a company or project) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating advanced AI methodologies with recursive strategies to enable continuous improvement and adaptation. Below is a conceptual design outline for building such a module:

### Module Overview
The aim is to create a dynamic and self-improving autonomy stack that can iteratively enhance its capabilities using machine learning, recursive improvement strategies, and adaptive feedback loops. The module, named `AutonomyExpander`, will consist of several components:

1. **Automated Recursive Learning**: A system that continually refines its models and strategies based on feedback.
2. **Adaptive Neural Architectures**: Neural networks that adjust their structure in response to performance metrics.
3. **Evolutionary Algorithm Integration**: Using genetic algorithms to explore novel strategies.
4. **Feedback Loop Mechanism**: Incorporate feedback-driven learning to improve decision-making processes.
5. **Self-Diagnostics and Repair**: Tools to identify and rectify inefficiencies autonomously.

### Module Design

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from sklearn import model_selection, metrics
from evolutionary_algorithm import EvoStrat
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class AutonomyExpander:
    def __init__(self, initial_model: nn.Module, data_loader, evo_strategy: EvoStrat):
        self.model = initial_model
        self.data_loader = data_loader
        self.evo_strategy = evo_strategy

    def recursive_training(self, epochs=10):
        """Perform recursive model training with performance feedback."""
        optimizer = optim.Adam(self.model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
        loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

        for cycle in range(epochs):
            for inputs, labels in self.data_loader:
                # Forward pass
                outputs = self.model(inputs)
                loss = loss_fn(outputs, labels)

                # Backward and optimize
                optimizer.zero_grad()
                loss.backward()
                optimizer.step()

            # Evaluate model performance and adapt
            self.evaluate_and_adapt(inputs, labels)

    def evaluate_and_adapt(self, inputs, labels):
        """Evaluate current model, adapt its architecture if needed, and trigger evolution."""
        # Compute performance metrics
        outputs = self.model(inputs)
        accuracy = metrics.accuracy_score(np.argmax(outputs.detach().numpy(), axis=1), labels.numpy())

        print(f'Validation Accuracy: {accuracy}')
        # Adaptive structure modification
        if accuracy < 0.8:  # Arbitrary threshold
            print("Modifying neural network architecture for better performance.")
            self.model = self.adaptive_structure(self.model)

            # Evolve new strategies for improving performance
            self.evo_strategy.evolve(self.model)
            print("Evolved new strategies.")

    def adaptive_structure(self, model: nn.Module) -> nn.Module:
        """Adapt the neural network's architecture."""
        # Example: Add a layer if required (basic scenario)
        modules = list(model.children())
        modules.append(nn.Linear(128, 256))  # Updated structure
        return nn.Sequential(*modules)

    def feedback_loop(self):
        """Incorporate real-time feedback into the learning mechanism."""
        print("Feedback loop not implemented yet.")
        # Future implementation: Real-time data integration for model updates.

    def self_diagnose_and_repair(self):
        """Detect and repair inefficiencies automatically."""
        print("Checking system integrity and optimizing components.")
        # Future implementation: Autonomous performance diagnostics and self-repair routines.


# Create a mock testing class and usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    initial_model = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(256, 128), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(128, 10))
    sample_data_loader = None  # Use an appropriate data loader
    evo_strategy = EvoStrat()  # Ensure that it's properly implemented
    autonomy_expander = AutonomyExpander(initial_model, sample_data_loader, evo_strategy)

    autonomy_expander.recursive_training()
    autonomy_expander.feedback_loop()
    autonomy_expander.self_diagnose_and_repair()

```

### Considerations

1. **Data Management**: Ensure the `data_loader` can provide dynamic data, potentially from real-time sources.
2. **Efficient Evolution**: When integrating evolutionary strategies, balance the exploration of new strategies with exploitation of known good strategies.
3. **Scalability**: Care should be taken to ensure the module adapts smoothly as the PTM's autonomy stack scales up.
4. **Security and Safety**: Since the system involves self-modifying code, ensure there are proper safety checks.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging to track changes and improvements over time.

This blueprint provides a foundation; adjustments and more sophisticated implementations may be required depending on PTM's specific objectives and resources.
