Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (we'll assume this stands for a fictional empire) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating innovative recursive strategies that allow systems to adapt, learn, and evolve over time. Here's a conceptual framework and a basic implementation outline:

### Key Concepts

1. **Self-evolution**: The system should have mechanisms to evolve its strategies and improve over time based on predefined goals and real-time feedback.

2. **Recursive Strategies**: Implement recursive algorithms where solutions are refined through recursive calls, improving both performance and adaptability.

3. **Modularity**: The module should be highly modular, allowing for easy integration and scalability.

4. **Reinforcement learning**: Integrate reinforcement learning for continuous adaptation and improvement of decision-making processes.

5. **Simulation-based testing**: Use simulations to test various scenarios recursively to choose optimal strategies.

```

### Implementation

#### evolver.py
This module is responsible for recursive learning and adapting strategies.

```python
import numpy as np
from decision_maker import DecisionMaker
from simulator import Simulator

class Evolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.decision_maker = DecisionMaker()
        self.simulator = Simulator()

    def evolve(self, iterations=100):
        for i in range(iterations):
            strategy = self.decision_maker.decide()
            performance = self.simulator.simulate(strategy)
            self.decision_maker.update_strategy(performance)
            print(f"Iteration {i}: Performance - {performance}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    evolver = Evolver()
    evolver.evolve()
```

#### decision_maker.py
This handles strategy decisions and learning.

```python
class DecisionMaker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_strategy = self._initialize_strategy()

    def _initialize_strategy(self):
        # Initialize a default strategy
        return np.random.rand(10)

    def decide(self):
        # Decide on a strategy
        return self.current_strategy

    def update_strategy(self, performance):
        # Simple example of updating strategy based on performance
        adjustment = performance * np.random.rand(10)
        self.current_strategy += adjustment
        self.current_strategy = np.clip(self.current_strategy, 0, 1)
```

#### simulator.py
This simulates the environment and tests strategies.

```python
class Simulator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.environment_state = self._create_environment()

    def _create_environment(self):
        # Initialize or load environment state
        return np.random.rand(10)

    def simulate(self, strategy):
        # Evaluate the strategy
        result = np.dot(self.environment_state, strategy)
        return result
```

#### utils.py
Utility functions for handling common operations.

```python
def normalize(vector):
    norm = np.linalg.norm(vector)
    if norm == 0:
       return vector
    return vector / norm
```

### Testing

Implement unit tests to ensure each component performs as expected. The `tests` directory contains test files for each module, using a testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest`.

### Considerations

- **Complexity Management**: Recursive strategies can increase complexity; ensure that maximum recursion limits aren't exceeded in Python and manage state efficiently.
- **Reinforcement Learning Frameworks**: Consider integrating with libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for more advanced learning capabilities.
- **Data Logging**: Implement data logging for later analysis and refinement.

This approach provides a robust framework for implementing a self-evolving autonomy stack. Adjust complexity and specific strategies based on the PTM empire's domain-specific needs.
