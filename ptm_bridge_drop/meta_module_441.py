Designing a Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably an Empire related to AI or Robotics) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves several key steps. Below is an outline for a hypothetical module named `PTM_Autonomy`. This module will focus on recursive learning and decision-making strategies that allow the system to improve iteratively and adapt over time.

### Module: PTM_Autonomy

#### 1. Module Overview

The `PTM_Autonomy` module aims to provide recursive strategies to bolster the self-evolving capabilities of PTM systems. It emphasizes on reinforcement learning, self-evaluation, and adaptability through recursive feedback loops.

#### 2. Key Components

1. **Recursive Learning System (RLS)**
    - **Objective**: Enable the system to learn from its own decisions and outcomes.
    - **Key Features**:
        - **Self-Assessment**: Continuously evaluate performance against set objectives.
        - **Feedback Loop**: Use results to refine future decision-making processes.

2. **Adaptive Decision Engine (ADE)**
    - **Objective**: Make decisions that adapt based on past performance.
    - **Key Features**:
        - **Reinforcement Learning**: Implement algorithms that reward successful strategies.
        - **Predictive Analysis**: Use historical data to anticipate future scenarios.

3. **Dynamic Strategy Optimizer (DSO)**
    - **Objective**: Optimize strategies dynamically as new data and feedback are received.
    - **Key Features**:
        - **Genetic Algorithms**: Employ these to evolve strategies over time based on performance.
        - **Simulation and Testing**: Run simulations to test new strategies in a controlled environment.

#### 3. Implementing the Module

```python
# ptm_autonomy.py

class RecursiveLearningSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_history = []
    
    def assess_performance(self, outcome):
        # Evaluate current outcome
        performance_score = self.evaluate_outcome(outcome)
        self.performance_history.append(performance_score)
        return performance_score
    
    def evaluate_outcome(self, outcome):
        # Placeholder for a real evaluation function
        return outcome.get('success', 0)

    def feedback_loop(self):
        # Adjust learning parameters based on historical performance
        if len(self.performance_history) > 1:
            recent_performance = self.performance_history[-1]
            past_performance = self.performance_history[-2]
            # Simple adjustment logic; replace with complex logic as needed
            if recent_performance < past_performance:
                self.adjust_learning_parameters()

    def adjust_learning_parameters(self):
        # Logic to adjust learning parameters
        print("Adjusting learning parameters for improved performance.")

class AdaptiveDecisionEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.decision_policy = {}
        
    def make_decision(self, state):
        # Placeholder decision-making logic
        decision = self.apply_policy(state)
        return decision
    
    def apply_policy(self, state):
        # Placeholder for using current policy
        return state in self.decision_policy

    def update_policy(self, reward):
        # Update policy based on received reward
        print(f"Updating policy with reward: {reward}")

class DynamicStrategyOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_strategy = None
    
    def optimize(self):
        # Logic to optimize strategy using genetic algorithms or other methods
        print("Optimizing strategy using genetic algorithms.")

def simulate_system_operation():
    rls = RecursiveLearningSystem()
    ade = AdaptiveDecisionEngine()
    dso = DynamicStrategyOptimizer()
    
    # Example recursive loop
    for epoch in range(10):
        print(f"Epoch: {epoch}")
        
        # Make decision
        state = "example_state"
        decision = ade.make_decision(state)
        
        # Simulate outcome
        outcome = {"success": 1 if decision else 0}
        
        # Assess performance
        score = rls.assess_performance(outcome)
        print(f"Performance score: {score}")
        
        # Provide feedback to learning system
        rls.feedback_loop()
        
        # Update decision policy
        ade.update_policy(outcome['success'])
        
        # Optimize strategy
        dso.optimize()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    simulate_system_operation()
```

#### 4. Recursive Strategies

- The module loops through epochs or cycles, constantly reassessing performance and adjusting strategies.
- Utilizes reinforcement learning to modify its decision engine based on rewards linked to outcomes.
- Incorporates genetic algorithms in the Dynamic Strategy Optimizer to evolve strategies.

#### 5. Future Enhancements

- Integrate advanced neural network models for deeper decision-making capabilities.
- Expand the genetic algorithms to include multi-objective optimization.
- Implement more robust simulation environments to test recursive strategies.

This module is an initial step towards building a comprehensive self-evolving autonomy stack for the PTM empire. It can be extended and refined as more complex requirements and data become available.
