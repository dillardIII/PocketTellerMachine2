Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a System or Organization's) self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves a careful approach that considers the architectural, algorithmic, and modular aspects for flexibility and scalability. Here’s a conceptual design:

### Module Name: `autonomous_expander`

#### Overview
The `autonomous_expander` module is designed to enhance the existing autonomy stack by introducing recursive strategies that enable self-evolving capabilities. The module focuses on learning, decision-making, and adaptation mechanisms.

#### Key Components

1. **Recursive Learning Engine**: A system that iteratively improves through self-refinement.
2. **Adaptive Decision-Maker**: Uses recursive decision trees and reinforcement learning.
3. **Self-Monitoring System**: Continuously evaluates performance and makes adjustments.
4. **Knowledge Base and Memory**: Stores and retrieves past experiences to inform future actions.
5. **Communication Interface**: Ensures seamless interaction between modules.

### Module Design

```python
# autonomous_expander/__init__.py

class AutonomousExpander:
    def __init__(self, initial_state):
        self.state = initial_state
        self.knowledge_base = KnowledgeBase()
        self.learning_engine = RecursiveLearningEngine(self.knowledge_base)
        self.decision_maker = AdaptiveDecisionMaker(self.knowledge_base)

    def run(self):
        while self.state.is_active():
            self.self_monitoring()
            self.update_state()

    def self_monitoring(self):
        # Execute a self-check to adjust parameters for optimal performance.
        current_performance = self.evaluate_performance()
        self.learning_engine.refine(current_performance)
        
    def update_state(self):
        decision = self.decision_maker.make_decision(self.state)
        # Update state based on decision
        self.state.update(decision)

    def evaluate_performance(self):
        # Implement performance evaluation logic
        return self.state.evaluate()

# RecursiveLearningEngine.py

class RecursiveLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_base):
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base

    def refine(self, current_performance):
        # Recursive refinement logic based on performance feedback
        self.knowledge_base.update(current_performance)

# AdaptiveDecisionMaker.py

class AdaptiveDecisionMaker:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_base):
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base

    def make_decision(self, state):
        # Use recursive decision-making strategies
        # Implement decision logic, potentially using decision trees and RL
        return decision

# KnowledgeBase.py

class KnowledgeBase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = {}

    def update(self, performance_data):
        # Store performance data to utilize in future decision-making and learning
        # Implement logic to maintain memory and make data-driven insights
        pass

# State.py

class State:
    def is_active(self):
        # Return if the state is currently active or not
        pass

    def update(self, decision):
        # Update the state based on decision
        pass

    def evaluate(self):
        # Evaluate the current state performance
        pass

# Communication Interface can be added to this for inter-module interactions

```

### Key Features

1. **Recursive Learning Engine**: This component continually refines its algorithms by learning from previous iterations and feedback, thereby enabling the system to evolve independently.
   
2. **Adaptive Decision-Maker**: Combines recursive algorithms with reinforcement learning to make increasingly efficient and effective decisions as it encounters new situations.

3. **Self-Monitoring System**: Evaluates current system performance and dynamically adjusts parameters and strategies, promoting continuous self-improvement.

4. **Knowledge Base**: Functions as memory, storing key data points and decisions to inform future actions—essential for adaptive learning and decision-making.

5. **Modular Design**: The system architecture allows for new strategies to be integrated easily, ensuring the autonomy stack can expand and evolve with changing requirements.

### Possible Enhancements

- **Integration with external sensors and data sources** to improve decision-making with real-time data.
- **Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms** to ensure resilience and reliability.
- **Machine Learning models** for more robust pattern recognition in decision-making processes. 

This setup forms the blueprint for a dynamic, self-evolving autonomy stack capable of scaling complexity and effectiveness over time.
