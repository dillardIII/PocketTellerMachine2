Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can learn, adapt, and evolve over time through the use of recursive strategies and advanced machine learning techniques. Below is a high-level design concept for such a module, making use of some advanced AI methodologies.

### Module Name: `EvoStack`

#### Overview
`EvoStack` is a Python module designed to improve the self-evolving capability of the PTM (Presumably "Powerful Task Manager") empire's autonomy stack. This module incorporates recursive learning strategies and self-improvement algorithms to enhance the decision-making and adaptability of robotic or software agents.

#### Key Features
1. **Recursive Learning Loop**: Implements a continuous learning loop where the system evaluates its own performance and autonomously decides which areas require improvement.

2. **Dynamic Memory Networks**: Utilizes dynamic memory networks for sophisticated pattern recognition and decision-making processes.

3. **Neuroevolution**: Employs neuroevolution—a form of genetic algorithm applied to neural network optimization—enabling the system to explore new architectures and hyperparameters for better performance.

4. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Includes mechanisms for multiple autonomous agents to share knowledge, collaborate in real-time, and evolve collectively.

5. **Adaptive Swarming**: Allows for groups of agents to dynamically form swarms with adaptive strategies based on the particular task environment.

#### Core Components

##### 1. Recursive Learning Engine
```python
class RecursiveLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_metrics = []
        self.improvement_threshold = 0.05

    def evaluate_and_learn(self, agent):
        current_performance = agent.evaluate_performance()
        self.performance_metrics.append(current_performance)
        
        if self.performance_metrics[-1] < max(self.performance_metrics) * (1 - self.improvement_threshold):
            self.optimize(agent)

    def optimize(self, agent):
        agent.optimize_architecture()
        agent.retrain()
```

##### 2. Dynamic Memory Networks
```python
class DynamicMemoryNetwork:
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size, memory_size):
        self.memory = np.zeros((memory_size, input_size))
        self.output_size = output_size

    def update_memory(self, new_data):
        self.memory = np.roll(self.memory, shift=-1, axis=0)
        self.memory[-1] = new_data

    def predict(self, input_data):
        combined_input = np.concatenate((self.memory.flatten(), input_data))
        return self._predict_internal(combined_input)
    
    def _predict_internal(self, input_data):
        # Simplified neural network prediction logic
        pass
```

##### 3. Neuroevolution
```python
class NeuroevolutionOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, population_size):
        self.population_size = population_size
        self.agents = self._initialize_agents()

    def _initialize_agents(self):
        # Initialize a population of neural network-based agents
        pass

    def evolve_population(self):
        # Evaluate and reproduce agents using genetic algorithms
        pass

    def optimize_agent(self, agent):
        # Apply neuroevolution to enhance the agent's neural architecture
        pass
```

##### 4. Multi-Agent Collaboration
```python
class MultiAgentSystem:
    def __init__(self, num_agents):
        self.agents = [SelfEvolvingAgent() for _ in range(num_agents)]

    def share_knowledge(self):
        global_knowledge = self._aggregate_knowledge()
        for agent in self.agents:
            agent.update_knowledge(global_knowledge)

    def _aggregate_knowledge(self):
        # Aggregates knowledge from all agents
        pass
```

##### 5. Adaptive Swarming
```python
class AdaptiveSwarm:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        self.agents = agents

    def adapt_and_solve(self, task):
        for agent in self.agents:
            agent.assess_task(task)
        self._formulate_swarm_strategy()

    def _formulate_swarm_strategy(self):
        # Develops an adaptive strategy for task completion
        pass
```

#### Usage
```python
from evostack import RecursiveLearningEngine, DynamicMemoryNetwork, NeuroevolutionOptimizer, MultiAgentSystem, AdaptiveSwarm

# Initialize components
recursive_engine = RecursiveLearningEngine()
memory_network = DynamicMemoryNetwork(256, 10, 100)
neuro_optimizer = NeuroevolutionOptimizer(50)
multi_agent_system = MultiAgentSystem(10)
adaptive_swarm = AdaptiveSwarm(multi_agent_system.agents)

# Example execution loop
for agent in multi_agent_system.agents:
    recursive_engine.evaluate_and_learn(agent)
    neuro_optimizer.optimize_agent(agent)
    adaptive_swarm.adapt_and_solve(current_task)
```

#### Conclusion
The `EvoStack` module provides a sophisticated framework for enhancing the autonomy of robotic or software agents through recursive strategies, advanced neural network techniques, and collaborative approaches. This framework allows the PTM empire to develop highly adaptive and intelligent systems that can anticipate and respond to their environments effectively.
