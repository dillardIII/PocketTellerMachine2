To design a Python module that expands the PTM (Presumably some fictional entity you're referring to) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack, we need to focus on concepts such as recursive programming, machine learning, autonomous decision-making, and evolving algorithms. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview and code of what such a module could look like:

### Overview

1. **Recursive Strategy Execution:** Employ recursive functions to enable dynamic problem solving where decisions at each level lead to more refined decision making downstream.
  
2. **Meta-Learning:** Utilize meta-learning (learning to learn) strategies to enable the system to adapt its learning algorithms based on previous executions.

3. **Autonomous Decision Trees:** Implement decision trees that evolve based on outcomes, building a more responsive and intelligent decision-making process.

4. **Reinforcement Learning:** Integrate reinforcement learning algorithms to allow the system to improve based on feedback from its environment.

5. **Neural Networks:** Use neural networks for pattern recognition and prediction as part of the autonomy stack.

6. **Self-Evaluation:** Build in mechanisms for the system to evaluate its own performance, thereby iterating on its processes.

### Python Module - `auto_evolver.py`

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam
import random

class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data, self.labels = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, random_state=42)
        self.model = self._build_neural_net()
        self.algorithm_threshold = 0.8
        self.experiments = []

    def _build_neural_net(self):
        model = Sequential([
            Dense(64, activation='relu', input_dim=20),
            Dense(32, activation='relu'),
            Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
        ])
        model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
        return model

    def _execute_recursive_strategy(self, depth, max_depth):
        if depth > max_depth:
            return
        
        x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(self.data, self.labels, test_size=0.2)
        self.model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, verbose=0)
        accuracy = self._evaluate_model(x_test, y_test)

        if accuracy < self.algorithm_threshold and depth < max_depth:  # Recursive enhancement
            self._experiment_new_strategy(depth + 1, max_depth)
        
    def _experiment_new_strategy(self, current_depth, max_depth):
        # Example strategy: Varying threshold or model architecture
        trial_threshold = self.algorithm_threshold - (0.1 * current_depth)
        print(f"Trying new strategy at depth {current_depth} with threshold: {trial_threshold:.2f}")

        self.model = self._build_neural_net()  # Reset and re-train
        x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(self.data, self.labels, test_size=0.2)
        self.model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, verbose=0)
        new_accuracy = self._evaluate_model(x_test, y_test)

        # Record experiment
        self.experiments.append((current_depth, new_accuracy))
        
        # Recurse if needed
        if new_accuracy < trial_threshold and current_depth < max_depth:
            self._execute_recursive_strategy(current_depth + 1, max_depth)
    
    def _evaluate_model(self, x_test, y_test):
        predictions = self.model.predict(x_test).flatten()
        predicted_labels = (predictions > 0.5).astype(int)
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predicted_labels)
        print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
        return accuracy

    def start_autonomy(self, max_depth=3):
        print("Starting Self-Evolving Autonomy Stack...")
        self._execute_recursive_strategy(depth=0, max_depth=max_depth)
        print("Experiments completed:", self.experiments)

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    autonomy_stack = AutonomyStack()
    autonomy_stack.start_autonomy()
```

### Key Features

1. **Recursive Calls:** The `_execute_recursive_strategy` initiates recursive strategy exploration when model performance is not meeting the threshold.

2. **Meta-Learning/Adaptation:** The algorithm attempts new strategies by altering thresholds and retraining, simulating a kind of meta-learning.

3. **Neural Network for Adaptation:** The module uses a simplistically structured neural network which is flexible enough to evolve with changing inputs and strategies.

4. **Dynamic Model Evaluation:** The stack evaluates its performance and adapts as needed, mimicking a form of recursive self-improvement.

This module serves as a starting point and can be further customized to include more sophisticated machine learning models, dynamic strategy adaptation, and intricate decision trees as required by the PTM empire's needs.
