Designing a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably for Performance and Task Management) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a flexible, adaptive, and intelligent system that leverages the latest advancements in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and complex systems. Below is a conceptual design for such a module, focusing on recursive strategies, adaptability, and self-evolution.

### Module: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Objectives
1. **Self-Adaptivity**: Continuously learn and adapt to new data and environments.
2. **Recursive Strategies**: Use recursive algorithms for decision-making and optimization.
3. **Self-Evolution**: Implement meta-learning techniques to evolve learning strategies over time.

#### Key Components

1. **Data Ingestion and Processing**
    - Dynamically gather and preprocess data from various sources.
    - Adaptive filters to improve data quality and relevance.

2. **Recursive Prediction Models**
    - Use recursive neural networks (RNN) for time-series predictions.
    - Recursive Bayesian networks for probabilistic reasoning and decision-making.
    - Implement recursive feature elimination to improve model efficiency.

3. **Meta-Learning Component**
    - Leverage techniques such as MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) to achieve fast adaptation to new tasks.
    - Continually evolve model parameters based on feedback and performance metrics.

4. **Feedback Loop Mechanism**
    - Implement positive and negative feedback loops to adjust model behavior dynamically.
    - Use reinforcement learning techniques (e.g., Q-Learning) for continuous improvement.

5. **AutoML Pipeline**
    - Automated machine learning pipeline to discover the best model architectures.
    - Incorporate genetic algorithms to evolve model structures over generations.

6. **Decision-Making Framework**
    - Use decision trees and random forests with a recursive feature to derive insights from complex data sets.
    - Integrate game theory strategies for competitive environments.

7. **Adaptation and Scaling**
    - Implement parallel processing for scaling the module across large data sets.
    - Use microservices architecture for modular and scalable deployment.

8. **Monitoring and Logging**
    - Continuous monitoring system to track model accuracy and system performance.
    - Logging mechanisms for auditing and debugging recursive processes.

    model.add(Dense(output_units, activation='softmax'))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Recursive Feature Elimination (simplified)

        model.fit(data[features], target)
        importances = model.feature_importances_
        least_important = np.argmin(importances)
        features = np.delete(features, least_important)
    return features

# Genetic Algorithm for Model Optimization

    creator.create("Individual", list, fitness=creator.FitnessMax)
    
    toolbox = base.Toolbox()
    toolbox.register("attr_float", np.random.rand)
    toolbox.register("individual", tools.initRepeat, creator.Individual, toolbox.attr_float, n=5)
    toolbox.register("population", tools.initRepeat, list, toolbox.individual)

    toolbox.register("evaluate", evaluate_func)
    toolbox.register("mate", tools.cxTwoPoint)
    toolbox.register("mutate", tools.mutGaussian, mu=0, sigma=1, indpb=0.2)
    toolbox.register("select", tools.selTournament, tournsize=3)

    population = toolbox.population(n=pop_size)
    _, logbook = algorithms.eaSimple(population, toolbox, cxpb=0.5, mutpb=0.2, ngen=ngen, verbose=False)
    return logbook

# Example Usage

    # Example: Training a Recursive Neural Network on dummy data
    X, y = np.random.rand(1000, 10), np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
    
    rnn_model = build_rnn((10,), 2)
    rnn_model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
    
    y_pred = rnn_model.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1))
    print(f'RNN Model Accuracy: {accuracy}')

    # Usage of Genetic Algorithm for optimization
    def dummy_evaluate(ind):
        return sum(ind),
    genetic_optimization(dummy_evaluate)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
