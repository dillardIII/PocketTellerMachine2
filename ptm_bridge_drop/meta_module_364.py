Designing a new Python module for the PTM (Presumably a fictional entity for your context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves several layers of complexity. Let's break this down into some key concepts and components that could form the basis of this module:

### Module Name:
```python
self_evolving_autonomy
```

### Key Concepts:

1. **Self-evolving Mechanism**: The ability for the system to improve itself autonomously.
2. **Recursive Learning**: Implementing strategies where functions call themselves to iteratively refine and optimize processes.
3. **Feedback Loops**: Mechanisms to incorporate feedback from the environment and previous iterations into the learning process.
4. **Modularity and Extensibility**: The design should allow for easy addition of new components and functionalities.

### Core Components:

1. **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**: Handle various data inputs and prepare them for model training and refinement.
2. **Recursive Learning Algorithms**: Implement recursive strategies for continuous improvement.
3. **Self-Monitoring and Diagnostics**: Create embedded tools for self-assessment and diagnostics.
4. **Automated Action Planning**: Develop algorithms for dynamic decision-making and action planning.
5. **Feedback Integration**: Mechanisms to incorporate feedback into the learning cycle.

Here's a high-level outline of how this might be implemented in Python:

```python
# self_evolving_autonomy.py

class SelfEvolvingAutonomy:
    def __init__(self, initial_data):
        self.data = initial_data
        self.model = self.initialize_model()
    
    def initialize_model(self):
        # Placeholder for model initialization logic
        return None

    def ingest_data(self, new_data):
        # Preprocess and integrate new data
        self.data += new_data
    
    def recursive_learning(self, depth=1, max_depth=5):
        if depth > max_depth:
            return
        
        # Placeholder for recursive learning algorithm
        print(f"Recursive learning iteration {depth}")
        
        # Update model based on current data
        self.train_model()

        # Evaluate model performance
        performance = self.evaluate_model()
        
        # Recursive call with increased depth if performance can be improved
        if not self.is_satisfactory(performance):
            self.recursive_learning(depth + 1, max_depth)
    
    def train_model(self):
        # Placeholder for model training logic
        pass
    
    def evaluate_model(self):
        # Placeholder for model evaluation logic
        # Return mock performance metric
        return 0.9
    
    def is_satisfactory(self, performance, threshold=0.95):
        return performance >= threshold

    def feedback_loop(self, feedback):
        # Integrate feedback into the system
        print("Integrating feedback...")
        self.ingest_data(feedback)
        self.recursive_learning()

    def autonomous_action(self):
        # Action planning based on the current model state
        print("Executing autonomous action...")
        # Placeholder for action logic
        pass

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    initial_data = []  # Assume some initial data
    module = SelfEvolvingAutonomy(initial_data)
    module.recursive_learning()
    module.autonomous_action()

    # Periodically integrate feedback
    feedback = []  # Assume gathered feedback data
    module.feedback_loop(feedback)
```

### Explanation:

- **Initialization and Data Ingestion**: Sets up the initial conditions and handles new data.
- **Recursive Learning**: Implements a basic form of recursive strategy to improve the model iteratively.
- **Feedback Loop**: Incorporates external feedback to enhance learning.
- **Autonomous Action**: Mechanism for taking action based on the current state of the system.

This module serves as a simple prototype and can be expanded with more advanced algorithms, actual model definitions, and real data processing capabilities. The recursive learning function can be made more sophisticated with adaptive depth adjustments, and the feedback system can incorporate more complex evaluation metrics and decision-making mechanisms.
