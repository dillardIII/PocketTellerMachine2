Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "Post-Turing Machines" or a similar conceptual empire) self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating advanced AI strategies, recursive functionalities, and innovative automation. Here’s a conceptual outline and initial code ideation for such a module incorporating recursive strategies such as recursive neural networks, transformers, and automated self-improvement.

### Design Outline for the Module: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Goals:
1. **Recursive Learning**: Leverage recursive strategies for continuous learning and adaptation.
2. **Self-Improvement**: Implement systems that improve with each iteration through experience.
3. **Modular Architecture**: Allow for easy expansion and adaptation of new technologies and algorithms.

### Key Components:

1. **Recursive Neural Networks**: Implement models that can perform tasks hierarchically.
2. **Transformers**: Use transformer architectures for their powerful sequence processing and predictive capabilities.
3. **Automated Feedback Loop**: Create feedback systems for self-assessment and adjustment.
4. **Modular Interface**: Classes and methods to allow easy expansion.

### Implementation Proposal

Below is a conceptual Python module structure that outlines key elements described.

```python
# ptm_autonomy/__init__.py

# ptm_autonomy/neural.py
import numpy as np

class RecursiveNeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.output_size = output_size

        self.W_hidden = np.random.rand(hidden_size, hidden_size)

    def forward(self, input_data):

        return output_data

        for epoch in range(epochs):
            predictions = self.forward(data)
            # Compute loss and update weights (not implemented here)

    def __init__(self):
        self.components = []

    def add_component(self, component):
        self.components.append(component)

    def execute(self, input_data):
        data = input_data
        for component in self.components:

        self.transformer = nn.Transformer(d_model=model_dim, nhead=num_heads, num_encoder_layers=num_layers)

    def forward(self, src, tgt):
        return self.transformer(src, tgt)

# Example usage:
# from ptm_autonomy import AutonomyBuilder, RecursiveNeuralNetwork, TransformerModel

# builder = AutonomyBuilder()
# rnn = RecursiveNeuralNetwork(10, 20, 5)
# transformer = TransformerModel(512, 512, 8, 6)

# builder.add_component(rnn)
# builder.add_component(transformer)
# output = builder.execute(input_data)

### Key Features Explained

- **Recursive Neural Network**: Incorporates recursive computation within a neural network to capture hierarchical structures.
- **Transformer Model**: Leverages state-of-the-art transformer architecture for robust sequence decoding.
- **Autonomy Builder**: A framework to add and chain different components (e.g., neural networks, transformers) for flexible execution.
- **Expandability**: Designed with modularity in mind, allowing further expansion with additional machine learning algorithms and strategies.

This module is a starting point, serving as a scaffolding that can be expanded and refined with more specific implementations, rigorous training procedures, and feedback mechanisms tailored to the PTM empire’s specific needs.
