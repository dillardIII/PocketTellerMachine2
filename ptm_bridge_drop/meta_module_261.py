Creating a Python module to expand the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves designing a system that allows for recursive learning and adaptive evolution in a dynamic environment. This module can leverage concepts from machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, and autonomous systems. Below is an outline and some sample code demonstrating an innovative approach using these concepts.

### Module Outline

1. **Evolutionary Algorithm Framework:**
   - Implement a genetic algorithm to optimize policy parameters.
   - Maintain a population of candidate solutions that evolve over time.

2. **Recursive Learning:**
   - Integrate reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to refine solutions.
   - Use recursive strategies to update the value functions based on feedback.

3. **Self-adaptive and Modular:**
   - Utilize a modular architecture allowing different components to evolve independently.
   - Implement self-adaptive mechanisms to adjust the evolution strategy parameters dynamically.

4. **Environment Interaction:**
   - Simulate interactions with the environment to gather data.
   - Use a hierarchical approach to model decision-making processes.

5. **Monitoring and Debugging Tools:**
   - Develop utilities for monitoring the learning and evolution process.
   - Implement logging and visualization for debugging and understanding system behavior.

### Sample Module Code

```python
import numpy as np
import random

# Define the problem environment (dummy environment for illustration)
class Environment:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_state(self):
        return np.random.rand(10)

    def evaluate(self, policy):
        return np.dot(self.get_state(), policy)

# Genetic Algorithm for Evolving Policies
class GeneticAlgorithm:
    def __init__(self, pop_size, policy_size, mutation_rate=0.01):
        self.pop_size = pop_size
        self.policy_size = policy_size
        self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate
        self.population = [np.random.rand(policy_size) for _ in range(pop_size)]

    def evolve(self, fitness_scores):
        new_population = []
        for _ in range(self.pop_size):
            parent1, parent2 = self.select_parents(fitness_scores)
            offspring = self.crossover(parent1, parent2)
            new_population.append(self.mutate(offspring))
        self.population = new_population

    def select_parents(self, fitness_scores):
        fitness_scores_sum = sum(fitness_scores)
        probs = [f / fitness_scores_sum for f in fitness_scores]
        parents_indices = np.random.choice(range(self.pop_size), size=2, p=probs)
        return self.population[parents_indices[0]], self.population[parents_indices[1]]

    def crossover(self, parent1, parent2):
        crossover_point = random.randint(1, self.policy_size - 1)
        return np.concatenate([parent1[:crossover_point], parent2[crossover_point:]])

    def mutate(self, policy):
        for i in range(self.policy_size):
            if np.random.rand() < self.mutation_rate:
                policy[i] = np.random.rand()
        return policy

# Recursive Reinforcement Learning
class RecursiveLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, environment, algorithm, max_iterations=100):
        self.env = environment
        self.algorithm = algorithm
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations

    def train(self):
        for _ in range(self.max_iterations):
            fitness_scores = [self.env.evaluate(policy) for policy in self.algorithm.population]
            self.algorithm.evolve(fitness_scores)
            best_policy = self.algorithm.population[np.argmax(fitness_scores)]
            value_estimation = self.recursive_value_function(best_policy)

    def recursive_value_function(self, policy):
        # This is a dummy implementation for illustration
        evaluation = self.env.evaluate(policy)
        return evaluation * 0.9 + np.random.rand() * 0.1  # Recursive value update

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    env = Environment()
    ga = GeneticAlgorithm(pop_size=20, policy_size=10)
    agent = RecursiveLearningAgent(environment=env, algorithm=ga)
    agent.train()
```
