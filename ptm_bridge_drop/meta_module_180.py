Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably something like Perception-Transform-Manipulation) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating cutting-edge recursive strategies and potentially leveraging machine learning for adaptive and self-improving capabilities. Here's a conceptual design:

### Module: `ptm_self_evolver`

#### Overview
The `ptm_self_evolver` module aims to enhance the autonomy stack through self-evolving capabilities. This involves recursive strategies for perception, transformation, and manipulation tasks, enabling continuous learning and adaptation without human intervention.

#### Key Components

1. **Perception Layer**
   - **Sensor Integration**: Collects data from various sensors.
   - **Recursive Feature Learning**: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) for feature extraction and continuous improvement.

2. **Transformation Layer**
   - **Adaptive Planning**: Uses Reinforcement Learning to adapt decision-making processes based on environmental feedback.
   - **Bayesian Networks**: For probabilistic reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty.

3. **Manipulation Layer**
   - **Dynamic Path Planning**: Implements adaptive algorithms like RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) with self-optimization capabilities.
   - **Feedback Loops**: Real-time feedback loops for adjusting manipulative actions.

4. **Learning and Adaptation System**
   - **Recursive Improvement**: Employs Genetic Algorithms (GA) to evolve models over iterations.
   - **Self-supervised Learning**: Utilizes unsupervised data to self-tune and improve performance.

5. **System Integration and Communication**
   - **Modular API**: Facilitates integration with other systems within the PTM stack.
   - **Distributed Computing Support**: Leverages cloud-based resources for intensive computation needs.

#### Recursive Strategies

1. **Recursive Feature Extraction**:
   - Uses LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) layers to understand temporal patterns in data.
   - Continuously refines feature sets based on newly acquired data.

2. **Self-Improving Decision Making**:
   - Employs Recursive Q-Learning to optimize decision policies in dynamic environments.
   - Uses past experiences to improve future outcomes.

3. **Model Evolution**:
   - Leverages Recursive Autoencoders for model compression and enhancement.
   - Continuously distills complex models into simpler, more efficient versions.

4. **Recursive Feedback Mechanisms**:
   - Implements feedback loops at each system layer to ensure recursive evaluation and modification.
   - Real-time parameter tuning based on performance metrics.

#### Example Code Skeleton

```python
class PTMSelfEvolver:
    def __init__(self, sensors, environment):
        self.sensors = sensors
        self.environment = environment
        self.perception_model = self._init_perception_model()
        self.planning_model = self._init_planning_model()
        self.manipulation_model = self._init_manipulation_model()

    def _init_perception_model(self):
        # Initialize a recursive perception model
        pass

    def _init_planning_model(self):
        # Initialize an adaptive planning model
        pass

    def _init_manipulation_model(self):
        # Initialize a dynamic manipulation model
        pass

    def update(self):
        # Gather sensor data
        sensor_data = self._collect_sensor_data()
        # Update perception model
        self.perception_model.update(sensor_data)
        # Plan actions
        actions = self.planning_model.plan(self.environment)
        # Execute actions
        self.manipulation_model.execute(actions)
        # Recursive improvement process
        self.recursive_improvement()

    def recursive_improvement(self):
        # Implement recursive strategies for self-evolution
        pass

    def _collect_sensor_data(self):
        # Collect and preprocess data from sensors
        pass

# Usage
sensors = ["camera", "lidar", "infrared"]
environment = "simulated_environment"
ptm = PTMSelfEvolver(sensors, environment)
ptm.update()
```

### Considerations

- **Scalability**: Ensure the module can scale with additional sensors or more complex environments.
- **Safety and Reliability**: Implement robust testing and validation to ensure safe operation.
- **Ethical and Privacy Concerns**: Consider ethical implications and privacy concerns associated with autonomous systems.

This conceptual design is a starting point, and the actual implementation will require detailed consideration of hardware integration, computational constraints, and specific use cases.
