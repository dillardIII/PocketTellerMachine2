Designing a Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably, "PTM" isn't defined in your request but we can think of it as a fictional empire's) self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies is a fascinating challenge. Below is a conceptual outline of such a module:

### Module Overview

The module should focus on self-evolution and autonomy using recursive strategies and adaptive learning. It is intended to help the PTM empire dynamically improve its processes and decision-making capabilities without external intervention.

### Key Features

1. **Recursive Learning Algorithms**: Implement algorithms that can dynamically learn from new data and past decisions.
2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Ability to adapt strategies based on environment changes and hindsight analysis.
3. **Self-Optimization**: Continuous self-improvement through recursive evaluation of different strategies.
4. **Automated Experimentation**: Launch experiments autonomously to explore new strategies or improve current processes.

### Technical Components

```python
import random
from typing import Any, Callable, List

class SelfEvolvingModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_base = []
        self.history = []

    def recursive_learning(self, input_data: List[Any], learning_function: Callable[[List[Any]], Any]):
        """
        Recursively learn from input data using specified learning function.
        """
        result = learning_function(input_data)
        self.knowledge_base.append(result)
        
        # Recursive call with updated knowledge base
        if not self.termination_condition_met():
            self.recursive_learning(self.knowledge_base, learning_function)

    def adaptive_decision_making(self, decision_function: Callable[[List[Any]], Any]):
        """
        Make adaptive decisions based on the current knowledge base.
        """
        decision = decision_function(self.knowledge_base)
        self.history.append(decision)

        # Adapt decisions based on feedback
        feedback = self.get_feedback()
        if feedback:
            # Modify decision strategy based on feedback
            self.modify_strategy(feedback)
        
    def self_optimization(self):
        """
        Continuously optimize strategies based on recursive evaluation.
        """
        current_best = self.evaluate_strategies()
        new_strategy = self.discover_new_strategy()

        if self.compare_strategies(new_strategy, current_best):
            self.knowledge_base.append(new_strategy)

    def automated_experimentation(self, experiment_function: Callable):
        """
        Launch experiments autonomously and learn from results.
        """
        result = experiment_function()
        if self.is_promising(result):
            self.knowledge_base.append(result)

    def termination_condition_met(self) -> bool:
        """Determine if the learning process should terminate."""
        # Placeholder for a real termination condition
        return len(self.knowledge_base) > 1000 

    def get_feedback(self) -> Any:
        """Placeholder for feedback retrieval method."""
        return random.choice([None, 'feedback'])

    def modify_strategy(self, feedback: Any):
        """Modify strategy based on feedback."""
        # Implement modification logic
        print(f"Modifying strategy based on feedback: {feedback}")

    def evaluate_strategies(self) -> Any:
        """Evaluate current strategies and determine the best one."""
        print("Evaluating strategies...")
        # Placeholder for evaluation logic

    def discover_new_strategy(self) -> Any:
        """Discover a new strategy."""
        print("Discovering new strategy...")
        # Placeholder for strategy discovery logic

    def compare_strategies(self, new_strategy: Any, current_best: Any) -> bool:
        """Compare two strategies."""
        print("Comparing new and current strategies...")
        # Placeholder for comparison logic
        return random.choice([True, False])

    def is_promising(self, result: Any) -> bool:
        """Determine if an experiment result is promising."""
        print("Assessing experiment promisingness...")
        return random.choice([True, False])
```

### Description & Usage

- **Recursive Learning**: This function uses recursive calls to continuously refine its knowledge base, simulating an iterative learning process. This example function can be replaced by machine learning models for real-world applications.
- **Adaptive Decision-Making**: It uses feedback mechanisms to adapt strategies, employing functions that simulate decision-making based on acquired knowledge.
- **Self-Optimization**: Evaluates current strategies and attempts to discover improvements, using recursive logic to test new strategies.
- **Automated Experimentation**: Conducts experiments and learns from them autonomously, enriching the knowledge base when promising results are found.

### Next Steps

1. Implement termination logic specific to your use case.
2. Integrate machine learning frameworks for real-world data handling, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
3. Expand on feedback mechanisms to include dynamic real-time data.
4. Replace placeholder logic with actual strategic elements relevant to the PTM empire.

This framework serves as a foundational model to create a self-evolving autonomy stack for dynamic and adaptive decision-making systems.
