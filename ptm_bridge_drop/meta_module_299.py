Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably, an abbreviation for an entity needing an autonomy stack) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a detailed consideration of the moduleâ€™s purpose, functionality, and architecture. The goal is to create a module that can autonomously adapt and improve over time through innovative recursive strategies. Below, I present a design proposal for such a module.

### Module Name: `auto_evolution`

### Key Features:

1. **Recursive Evolutionary Algorithms**
   - Implement recursive algorithms that can evolve the model based on performance feedback.
   - Use a combination of genetic algorithms and neural networks to enable continuous learning and adaptation.

2. **Autonomous Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Leverage Bayesian optimization and grid search, enhanced with genetic programming, to autonomously refine hyperparameters for better performance.

3. **Self-Monitoring and Feedback Loops**
   - Implement self-monitoring mechanisms to evaluate performance metrics and identify opportunities for improvements.
   - Use feedback loops to adjust strategies based on real-time performance analysis.

4. **Modular Architecture for Adaptability**
   - Design the module to be highly modular, allowing for easy customization and expansion of functionalities.

5. **Machine Learning Model Integration**
   - Provide seamless integration with existing machine learning models and data pipelines. Support frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

6. **Real-Time Evolution Tracking**
   - Incorporate visualization tools to track the evolution and performance of models in real time, aiding in transparent decision-making.

7. **Regenerative Learning Capacity**
   - Allow the module to reset and initialize new learning paths if current approaches underperform or become obsolete.
   
8. **Secure and Ethical AI Practices**
   - Integrate ethical guidelines and security protocols to ensure the safe deployment of autonomous strategies.

### Initial Implementation Blueprint:

```python
# auto_evolution module

# Required imports
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class SelfEvolvingModel:
    def __init__(self, model, data, labels):
        self.model = model
        self.data = data
        self.labels = labels
        self.history = []

    def train_and_evaluate(self):
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(self.data, self.labels, test_size=0.2)
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions = self.model.predict(X_test)
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
        self.history.append(accuracy)
        return accuracy

    def recursive_optimize(self, iterations=10):
        for i in range(iterations):
            accuracy = self.train_and_evaluate()
            print(f"Iteration {i+1}: Model Accuracy = {accuracy}")
            # Pseudo-code for recursive strategy
            # Evolve hyperparameters or model architecture
            self.hyperparameter_tuning()
    
    def hyperparameter_tuning(self):
        # Implement hyperparameter tuning strategy here
        pass
    
    def visualize_evolution(self):
        plt.plot(self.history)
        plt.xlabel('Iteration')
        plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
        plt.title('Model Evolution Over Time')
        plt.show()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Mock data and model
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    
    data = load_iris().data
    labels = load_iris().target
    model = DecisionTreeClassifier()

    evolving_model = SelfEvolvingModel(model, data, labels)
    evolving_model.recursive_optimize()
    evolving_model.visualize_evolution()
```

### Future Directions:

- **Integration with Reinforcement Learning**: Use RL agents to dynamically control and adjust model evolution strategies.
- **Cross-Domain Learning**: Enable the module to adapt strategies from one domain to another.
- **Collaborative Autonomy**: Design features to allow multiple modules to communicate and share learned experiences.

This blueprint provides a strong foundation for an autonomous, self-evolving stack designed for the PTM empire's needs, incorporating recursive strategies and adaptability as core principles. Further iterations and refinements would enhance the module's contextual intelligence and performance accuracy.
