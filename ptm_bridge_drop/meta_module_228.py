Creating a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably a fictional entity as there is no context of PTM empire in real-world machine learning discussions) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves several steps. Below is a conceptual design for such a module with a focus on recursive strategies that could help models evolve and improve over time.

### Module: `evolving_autonomy.py`

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import random

# Define the main class for the autonomy system
class AutonomousSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = None
        self.history = []
        self.self_improvement_rate = 0.1
        self.recursions = 0

    def initialize_model(self, initial_model):
        """Initialize the system with a starting model."""
        self.model = initial_model
        self.history.append(initial_model)

    def recursive_evolution(self, data, max_recursions=10):
        """Evolve the model using recursive strategies."""
        while self.recursions < max_recursions:
            self.recursions += 1
            improvement_factor = self.calculate_improvement_factor()

            # Checkpointing before attempting improvement
            checkpoint_model = self.model
            
            # Attempt model improvement
            self.model = self.improve_model(self.model, improvement_factor, data)
            self.history.append(self.model)
            
            if not self.is_improvement_sufficient(checkpoint_model, self.model):
                # Revert if improvement is not sufficient
                self.model = checkpoint_model
                print(f"Reverted to previous model at recursion level {self.recursions}.")
                break

    def calculate_improvement_factor(self):
        """Randomly decide the improvement factor based on self-improvement rate."""
        return random.uniform(1.0, 1.0 + self.self_improvement_rate)

    def improve_model(self, current_model, factor, data):
        """Improve the model by updating it based on samples and factors."""
        # Apply a fictional transformation to simulate an 'improvement'
        improved_model = current_model + np.random.normal(scale=factor, size=current_model.shape)

        # Update model based on data fitness
        fitness = self.evaluate_model_fitness(improved_model, data)
        return improved_model * fitness

    def evaluate_model_fitness(self, model, data):
        """Evaluate the model's fitness based on the data."""
        return np.mean(data @ model)

    def is_improvement_sufficient(self, old_model, new_model):
        """Check if a new model is significantly better."""
        improvement_threshold = 0.01  # 1% improvement
        return np.linalg.norm(new_model - old_model) > improvement_threshold

# Below we define a sample flow for using this module.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Hypothetical situation where the model is an array.
    initial_model = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
    test_data = np.random.rand(100, 2)

    # Initialize autonomous system
    system = AutonomousSystem()
    system.initialize_model(initial_model)

    # Run the recursive evolution of the model
    system.recursive_evolution(test_data)

    # Output the final model
    print("Final Model:", system.model)
    print("Evolution History:", system.history)
```

### Key Features:

1. **Recursive Evolution**: The `recursive_evolution` method iteratively updates the model. It stops if the model does not sufficiently improve after a recursion.

2. **Improvement Factor**: A random improvement factor influences the model's evolution in a more dynamic, non-linear fashion.

3. **Forking & Checkpointing**: The system evaluates the progress at each step and can roll back to earlier checkpoints if the improvement isn't significant, maintaining the stability.

4. **Fitness Evaluation**: A basic fitness metric guides the improvement process, simulating the real-world strategy where systems learn from environments.

5. **Self-improvement Rate**: A configurable parameter simulates a real-world evolving autonomy stack's ability to learn at different paces.

This module serves as a basic framework and can be extended to include more complex features such as model awareness, additional layers of feedback, and integration with more advanced ML frameworks.
