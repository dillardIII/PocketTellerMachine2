Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack is an intriguing challenge. Below, Iâ€™ll outline a high-level structure and key features for this module. This module will focus on recursive strategies that enable systems to self-improve over time using machine learning techniques, automated feedback loops, and evolutionary algorithms.

### Module: `ptm_self_evolve`

#### Key Features

1. **Autonomous Learning Core**: Implement a central class that can initiate, manage, and improve upon tasks autonomously. The core should handle data ingestion, initial training, performance evaluation, and subsequent retraining.

2. **Recursive Improvement**: Develop a strategy for recursive model improvement. This involves re-evaluating models and strategies continuously and recursively adjusting based on performance metrics.

3. **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Use evolutionary algorithms to guide the evolution of various models. Implement techniques like genetic algorithms to select the optimal configurations.

4. **Feedback Loop Integration**: Create an automated feedback system that uses collected data to adjust and optimize processes dynamically.

5. **Modular Architecture**: Allow for modular integration with existing stacks to enable flexibility and extensibility.

6. **Simulation Environment**: A sandbox environment for testing hypothetical scenarios and determining strategies' effectiveness before deployment in the real world.

### Example Structure

```python
# File: ptm_self_evolve/__init__.py

__version__ = '0.1.0'

# File: ptm_self_evolve/autonomous_core.py

import random

class AutonomousCore:
    def __init__(self, data_sources):
        self.data_sources = data_sources
        self.models = []
        self.history = []

    def train_initial_models(self):
        # Implement a method to train initial models using the given data sources
        pass

    def evaluate_models(self):
        # Implement a method to evaluate models and return performance metrics
        pass

    def recursive_improvement(self):
        # Implement a recursive strategy to improve models
        improved_models = []
        for model in self.models:
            improved_model = self._improve_model(model)
            improved_models.append(improved_model)
        self.models = improved_models

    def _improve_model(self, model):
        # Placeholder for model improvement logic
        # Example: Apply genetic algorithm for model parameter tuning
        return model

# File: ptm_self_evolve/evolutionary_algorithm.py

class EvolutionaryAlgorithm:
    def __init__(self, initial_population):
        self.population = initial_population
    
    def evolve(self, generations=100):
        for generation in range(generations):
            self._selection()
            self._crossover()
            self._mutation()

    def _selection(self):
        # Implement selection-based on model performance
        pass

    def _crossover(self):
        # Implement crossover logic to create new offspring
        pass

    def _mutation(self):
        # Implement mutation logic to introduce variation
        pass

# File: ptm_self_evolve/feedback_system.py

class FeedbackSystem:
    def __init__(self, autonomous_core):
        self.core = autonomous_core

    def collect_feedback(self):
        # Collect and process feedback, then adjust strategies
        pass
        
    def integrate_feedback_loop(self):
        feedback = self.collect_feedback()
        # Adjust core based on feedback
        self.core.recursive_improvement()

# File: ptm_self_evolve/simulation_environment.py

class SimulationEnvironment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_state = None
    
    def run_scenario(self, scenario):
        # Simulate a scenario
        pass

### Usage Example

```python
from ptm_self_evolve import AutonomousCore, EvolutionaryAlgorithm, FeedbackSystem

# Initialize data sources
data_sources = ['data_source_1.csv', 'data_source_2.csv']

# Initialize the autonomous core with data sources
autonomous_core = AutonomousCore(data_sources)

# Train initial models
autonomous_core.train_initial_models()

# Evaluate and improve models recursively
autonomous_core.recursive_improvement()

# Set up the feedback system
feedback_system = FeedbackSystem(autonomous_core)
feedback_system.integrate_feedback_loop()

# Evolutionary computation
initial_population = []  # Define your initial population
evolutionary_algorithm = EvolutionaryAlgorithm(initial_population)
evolutionary_algorithm.evolve(generations=50)

# Simulate and test
simulation = SimulationEnvironment()
simulation.run_scenario('test_scenario')
```

### Explanation

- **AutonomousCore**: Manages the lifecycle of data and models, focusing on recursive self-improvement.
- **EvolutionaryAlgorithm**: Facilitates optimization through evolutionary strategies, tuning models for better performance.
- **FeedbackSystem**: Constantly collects data to inform and adjust the strategy, creating a closed-loop system.
- **SimulationEnvironment**: Runs hypothetical tests to validate strategies before real-world application.

This module represents a foundational step towards creating a self-evolving autonomy stack, utilizing recursive and evolutionary strategies to enable continuous learning and adaptation.
