Designing a Python module to expand the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can learn, adapt, and improve itself over time using recursive strategies. The system should make efforts to leverage advanced machine learning techniques, principally focusing on recursive and meta-learning strategies. Here is a high-level design outline for such a module:

### Module Name
`ptm_autonomy_stack`

### Key Components

1. **Data Handling Subsystem (`data_handling.py`):**
   - **Data Ingestion:** Functions to ingest data from multiple sources (real-time sensors, user interactions, historical data).
   - **Preprocessing:** Cleaning and normalizing data for better results.
   - **Data Augmentation:** Strategies to synthetically augment data for enhanced learning.

2. **Recursive Learning Subsystem (`recursive_learning.py`):**
   - **Recursive Neural Networks:** Implement models that leverage recursive structures (e.g., Tree LSTMs, Recursive Neural Tensor Networks) to learn from hierarchical data.
   - **Feedback Loops:** Mechanisms to loop outputs back as inputs to iteratively refine predictions.
   - **Recursive Feature Generation:** Algorithmically generate new features recursively to improve learning outcomes.

3. **Meta-Learning Subsystem (`meta_learning.py`):**
   - **Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML):** Implement MAML to allow rapid adaptation of models to new tasks with minimal data.
   - **Self-Supervised Learning:** Utilize self-supervised strategies to learn useful representations without explicit labels.
   - **Transfer Learning:** Methods to transfer learning from one domain/task to another to leverage existing knowledge.

4. **Autonomy & Decision-Making Subsystem (`autonomy_decision.py`):**
   - **Reinforcement Learning:** Implement algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for decision-making tasks.
   - **Recursive Decision Trees:** Use decision trees that recursively refine themselves using ensemble methods.
   - **Bayesian Inference:** Integrate probabilistic models to make well-informed decisions under uncertainty.

5. **Monitoring & Evaluation Subsystem (`evaluation.py`):**
   - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Methodology for automated testing and deployment of models.
   - **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time metrics to monitor performance and adapt strategies.
   - **Recursiveness Testing:** Ensure the recursive strategies effectively converge and improve over time.

6. **Self-Improvement Subsystem (`self_improvement.py`):**
   - **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Algorithms like Bayesian optimization to continuously tune hyperparameters.
   - **Architecture Search:** Automated search for optimal neural network architectures using approaches like Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
   - **Lifelong Learning:** Enable models to continuously learn from new data without forgetting previously learned information.

### Recursive Strategies

- **Recursive Model Training:** Models trained recursively over multiple scales and domains to generalize better.
- **Recursive Update Mechanism:** Gradual improvements with regular audits on model performance based on new data in a recursive update framework.
- **Modular Implementations:** Each module can be invoked recursively for efficient modular and hierarchal problem-solving.

### Additional Considerations

- **Scalability:** Ensure modules are designed to handle increases in scale (data, computational resources).
- **Interoperability:** Facilitate smooth interaction between different subsystems and external systems.
- **Security & Robustness:** Implement security measures to safeguard data integrity and protect the system from adversarial attacks.

### Example of a Recursive Learning Algorithm

```python
class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, model, data):
        self.model = model
        self.data = data

    def recursive_train(self, depth=1):
        if depth == 0:
            return self.model.fit(self.data)

        # Recursive data division or feature synthesis
        data_partitions = self.divide_data(self.data)
        models = []
        for partition in data_partitions:
            sub_learner = RecursiveLearner(self.model, partition)
            trained_model = sub_learner.recursive_train(depth - 1)
            models.append(trained_model)

        # Implement a mechanism to combine results from recursive training
        return self.combine_models(models)

    def divide_data(self, data):
        # Logic to divide data into meaningful partitions
        return [data]  # Simplified

    def combine_models(self, models):
        # Logic to combine trained models
        return models[0]  # Simplified
```

This design provides a comprehensive framework for building a self-evolving autonomous system that leverages innovative recursive strategies to improve its learning and decision-making capabilities over time. Adaptability and modularity are central to ensure continuous evolution.
