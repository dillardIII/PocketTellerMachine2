Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "Part-Time Millionaire," though it could stand for something else, so feel free to specify) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating components capable of autonomous learning, decision-making, and recursive development. Below, I'll outline a conceptual design for this module, focusing on recursive strategies and innovative approaches for self-evolving capabilities.

### Module Overview

The new module, `AutoSelf`, will integrate several key components and strategies:

1. **Recursive Learning Agent (RLA)**: A core agent that continuously learns from its environment and refines its models through recursive feedback loops.
2. **Self-Optimization Process (SOP)**: Algorithms designed to continuously optimize performance, resource management, and decision-making processes.
3. **Evolutionary Algorithm Integration (EAI)**: Utilization of genetic algorithms and other evolutionary strategies to explore and evolve new solutions.
4. **Autonomous Planner (AP)**: An AI planner that autonomously designs tasks and goals based on strategic objectives and self-assessment.
5. **Meta-Strategy Module (MSM)**: A higher-level module that decides when and how to revise strategies autonomously.

### Key Features and Strategies

#### Recursive Learning Agent (RLA)

- **Functionality**: Continuously updates its internal models based on real-time data.
- **Recursive Feedback Loop**: Inputs environmental data, applies learned strategies, evaluates outcomes, and modifies the core algorithms to improve future performance.
- **Adaptive Neural Networks**: Uses neural networks that adapt by adding or pruning neurons based on performance vectors.

```python
class RecursiveLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = self._initialize_model()
        
    def _initialize_model(self):
        # Initialize a neural network or other learning model
        pass
        
    def learn(self, data):
        # Update the model based on new data
        pass
        
    def evaluate(self, feedback):
        # Use feedback to recursively improve model parameters
        pass
```

#### Self-Optimization Process (SOP)

- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Adapts the use of computational resources based on task demands.
- **Performance Metrics**: Continuously measures performance and adjusts parameters to optimize efficiency and results.
- **Continuous Integration**: Incorporates new data and strategies without significant downtime or manual intervention.

```python
class SelfOptimizationProcess:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_metrics = {}
        
    def assess_performance(self):
        # Regularly evaluates system performance
        pass
    
    def optimize(self):
        # Adjusts internal processes and resources
        pass
```

#### Evolutionary Algorithm Integration (EAI)

- **Genetic Algorithms**: Leverages mutation and crossover techniques to explore novel strategies and solutions.
- **Diverse Solution Pools**: Maintains a pool of diverse, potentially optimal solutions which evolve over time.
  
```python
class EvolutionaryAlgorithm:
    def __init__(self):
        self.population = self._initialize_population()
        
    def _initialize_population(self):
        # Creates an initial set of potential solutions
        pass
    
    def evolve(self):
        # Apply genetic operations to evolve the solutions
        pass
```

#### Autonomous Planner (AP)

- **Task Scheduling**: Automatically prioritizes and schedules tasks based on strategic objectives.
- **Goal Adaptation**: Revises goals based on performance metrics and environmental changes.

```python
class AutonomousPlanner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.goals = []
        
    def plan(self):
        # Develops and schedules plans to achieve set objectives
        pass
    
    def adapt_goals(self):
        # Revises goals as necessary
        pass
```

#### Meta-Strategy Module (MSM)

- **Understands the Big Picture**: Analyzes overall performance, market conditions, and strategic success.
- **Strategic Revisions**: Proactively updates the overall strategy to align with long-term objectives and adaptation to change.

```python
class MetaStrategyModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_strategy = None
        
    def evaluate_strategy(self):
        # Assesses the current strategy's effectiveness
        pass
    
    def revise_strategy(self):
        # Updates the strategy for improved efficiency and effectiveness
        pass
```

### Integration and Execution Environment

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: The module will operate within an event-driven environment to ensure responsiveness and real-time performance.
- **Robust APIs and Interfaces**: Design clear interfaces that allow seamless integration with other modules and systems within the PTM empire.

### Summary

By integrating these recursive strategies and leaning heavily on evolving algorithms, the `AutoSelf` module will enable the PTM empire to maintain a cutting-edge autonomous stack that continuously adapts and optimizes itself. This module acts as a cohesive framework to empower agents and systems with self-evolving abilities.
