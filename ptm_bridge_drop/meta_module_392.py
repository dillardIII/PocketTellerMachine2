Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "PTM" for "Predicative Turing Machines" or just a fictional tech company) empireâ€™s self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies is a challenging task. Below is a high-level overview of what such a module might look like, including comments and potential features:

```python
# import necessary libraries
import copy
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Callable

# Define a base class for self-evolving components
@dataclass
class AutonomousComponent:
    state: Dict[str, Any]
    transformation_rules: List[Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], Dict[str, Any]]]

    def apply_transformation(self):
        for rule in self.transformation_rules:
            try:
                new_state = rule(copy.deepcopy(self.state))
                self.state.update(new_state)
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Transformation error: {e}")

# Recursive Self-Evolving Strategy Interface
class RecursiveStrategy:
    def evolve(self, components: List[AutonomousComponent]):
        pass

# Concrete Recursive Strategy
class RecursiveOptimizationStrategy(RecursiveStrategy):
    def evolve(self, components: List[AutonomousComponent]):
        for component in components:
            original_state = copy.deepcopy(component.state)
            
            # Apply transformations recursively
            component.apply_transformation()

            # Compare states and adjust further if needed
            while original_state != component.state:
                original_state = copy.deepcopy(component.state)
                component.apply_transformation()

# Example Transformation Rule Function
def enhance_accuracy(state: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Hypothetical transformation logic
    state['accuracy'] = min(state.get('accuracy', 0) * 1.1, 100)
    return state

# Example autonomous component creation
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create an autonomous component with initial state and transformation rules
    component = AutonomousComponent(
        state={'accuracy': 80},
        transformation_rules=[enhance_accuracy]
    )

    # Instantiate the strategy
    strategy = RecursiveOptimizationStrategy()

    # Evolves the component using the recursive strategy
    strategy.evolve([component])

    # Output the final state of the component
    print(component.state)
```

### Key Concepts:

1. **Autonomous Components**: Each component manages its state and transformation rules, which are applied recursively.

2. **Transformation Rules**: Functions that modify the state. They must ensure state changes are valid and beneficial.

3. **Recursive Strategy**: A strategy class that manages the evolution process. It utilizes a recursive approach to continually apply transformations until stability is achieved or no further improvements are possible.

4. **Safety and Debugging**: The code includes error handling to ensure that issues during transformation do not crash the system. Debugging information is printed to the console when transformations fail.

5. **Modularity & Scalability**: The module design is highly modular, allowing easy addition of new components and strategies, and easily scaling across various system complexities.

6. **Dataclasses**: Python's `dataclasses` are used for easier management of component states, making the design more readable and maintainable.

This outline is an abstract scaffold and should be adapted with domain-specific logic and components to effectively build a self-evolving autonomy stack proper to the PTM empire's needs.
