Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional organization) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack is an exciting challenge that requires innovative thinking and an understanding of recursive strategies. Below is a conceptual outline of a Python module that could achieve this:

```python
# autonomy_stack.py

import random
import logging


class SelfEvolvingAutonomy:
    def __init__(self, initial_strategies, growth_factor=1.1):
        # Initialize with a set of initial strategies
        self.strategies = initial_strategies
        self.growth_factor = growth_factor
        self.evaluate_strategies()
    
    def add_strategy(self, strategy_function):
        """
        Adds a new strategy to the autonomy stack.
        """
        if callable(strategy_function):
            self.strategies.append(strategy_function)
            logging.info(f"New strategy added: {strategy_function.__name__}")
        else:
            logging.warning("Invalid strategy. It must be a callable function.")
    
    def evaluate_strategies(self):
        """
        Evaluates all strategies and applies a self-improvement algorithm.
        """
        effectiveness = {}
        for strategy in self.strategies:
            effectiveness[strategy.__name__] = self.simulate_strategy(strategy)
        
        # Recursively optimize strategies by applying a random mutation
        self.optimize_strategies(effectiveness)
    
    def simulate_strategy(self, strategy):
        """
        Simulates a strategy to determine its effectiveness.
        """
        # Placeholder simulation logic
        result = strategy(random.uniform(0.8, 1.2))  # Simulated input for demonstration
        logging.debug(f"Strategy {strategy.__name__} resulted in {result}")
        return result
    
    def optimize_strategies(self, effectiveness):
        """
        Optimize strategies based on their effectiveness.
        """
        logging.info("Optimizing strategies...")
        optimized_strategies = []
        for strategy_name, score in effectiveness.items():
            if score >= 1.0:  # If effective, enhance it by the growth factor
                enhanced_strategy = self.enhance_strategy(strategy_name)
                optimized_strategies.append(enhanced_strategy)
            else:
                logging.info(f"Strategy {strategy_name} needs revision.")
        
        self.strategies = optimized_strategies
        logging.info(f"Optimization complete. {len(self.strategies)} strategies retained.")
    
    def enhance_strategy(self, strategy_name):
        """
        Applies a growth factor to enhance a particular strategy.
        """
        for strategy in self.strategies:
            if strategy.__name__ == strategy_name:
                def enhanced(input_value):
                    return strategy(input_value) * self.growth_factor
                
                enhanced.__name__ = f"{strategy_name}_enhanced"
                logging.debug(f"Enhanced strategy created: {enhanced.__name__}")
                return enhanced
        return None


# Examples of initial strategies
def sample_strategy_1(input_value):
    # A simple algorithm example
    return input_value * 2

def sample_strategy_2(input_value):
    # Another simple algorithm example
    return input_value + 5


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set up logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
    
    # Initialize the autonomy stack
    strategies = [sample_strategy_1, sample_strategy_2]
    autonomy_system = SelfEvolvingAutonomy(strategies)
    
    # Example: Add a new strategy dynamically
    def new_dynamic_strategy(input_value):
        return input_value ** 0.5
    
    autonomy_system.add_strategy(new_dynamic_strategy)
    autonomy_system.evaluate_strategies()
```

### Key Features of the Module:
1. **Dynamic Strategy Management:**
   - Strategies are managed dynamically and can be added at runtime.
   
2. **Recursive Optimization:**
   - The module uses a recursive approach to evaluate and optimize strategies based on their effectiveness.
   
3. **Growth Factor:**
   - Successful strategies are enhanced by a growth factor, simulating a learning and evolving process.

4. **Logging and Feedback:**
   - Informative logging is included to give insights into the effectiveness of strategies and the optimization process.

### Considerations:
- The strategies should be designed to accommodate real-world scenarios relevant to PTMâ€™s autonomy stack.
- Additional methodologies, such as machine learning, could be integrated into this architecture for more sophisticated self-evolution.
- Proper error handling and exception management should be added for robust production-level code.

The above design is a strategic framework leveraging Python's flexibility, embracing an innovative approach to self-evolving recursive strategies within an autonomy stack.
