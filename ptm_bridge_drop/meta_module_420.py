Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably referring to a hypothetic organization) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies is an ambitious task. The goal here is to establish a system that can autonomously improve its decision-making algorithms through self-reflection and recursive optimization techniques. Below is an outline and a basic implementation plan for a Python module that could potentially fit such requirements.

### Overview:

The module aims to:
1. Continuously learn and adapt using recursive strategies.
2. Optimize its own processes by evaluating performance and implementing necessary improvements.
3. Interface seamlessly with existing systems within the PTM empire.

### Key Components:

1. **Recursive Learning Engine (RLE):** Continuously refines its own learning algorithms through recursive analysis.
2. **Autonomy Evaluator:** Assesses decision-making quality and identifies areas for improvement.
3. **Adaptive Algorithm Tuner:** Dynamically adjusts parameters of algorithms to enhance performance based on feedback from the evaluator.
4. **Interfacing Layer:** Facilitates communication between this module and other components of the PTM's autonomy stack.

### Module Implementation:

Here's a basic scaffold to help illustrate how this Python module could be structured.

```python
class RecursiveLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_log = []
        self.current_model = self.initialize_model()

    def initialize_model(self):
        # Initialize model with default parameters
        return self.some_initial_model()

    def recursive_optimization(self):
        # Pseudo-code for a recursive strategy
        for i in range(self.num_iterations):
            performance = self.evaluate_model(self.current_model)
            self.performance_log.append(performance)
            if self.needs_improvement(performance):
                self.current_model = self.improve_model(self.current_model)

    def evaluate_model(self, model):
        # Evaluate the model's performance
        return self.some_evaluation_metric(model)

    def needs_improvement(self, performance):
        # Determine if the model's performance needs improvement
        return performance < self.threshold()

    def improve_model(self, model):
        # Pseudo-code to improve model using recursive strategies
        new_model = model.copy()
        # Modify model parameters
        return new_model


class AutonomyEvaluator:
    def assess(self, model):
        # Use domain-specific assessments to evaluate autonomy
        return model.evaluate_performance()

    def identify_areas_of_improvement(self, performance):
        # Identify weaknesses in the model's abilities
        pass


class AdaptiveAlgorithmTuner:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model

    def tune_parameters(self):
        # Adjust parameters based on evaluator feedback
        pass


class InterfaceLayer:
    def communicate(self):
        # Handle connections between this module and other components
        pass


# Example of how these components could be integrated

def main():
    # Initialize components
    rle = RecursiveLearningEngine()
    evaluator = AutonomyEvaluator()
    tuner = AdaptiveAlgorithmTuner(rle.current_model)
    
    # Run recursive optimization process
    rle.recursive_optimization()
    
    # Assess the model
    performance = evaluator.assess(rle.current_model)
    
    # Tune the model based on evaluation
    if evaluator.identify_areas_of_improvement(performance):
        tuner.tune_parameters()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Considerations:

- **Scalability:** Ensure that the module can scale as the complexity of tasks increases within the PTM empire.
- **Integration:** The interfacing layer should support multiple communication protocols to integrate with existing autonomy systems.
- **Security and Reliability:** With autonomy comes increased risk. Implement security measures to safeguard against erroneous decision-making.
- **Auditability:** Maintain a log of decisions and performance evaluations for future audits and assessments.

### Conclusion:

This is a high-level concept for creating an autonomy stack that evolves autonomously using recursive strategies. The actual implementation would involve advanced machine learning and AI techniques tailored to PTM's specific domain requirements.
