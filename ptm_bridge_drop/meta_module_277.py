Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumable Technical Module) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves several key steps. We'll focus on incorporating innovative recursive strategies that allow for continuous learning and adaptation. Below, I'll outline a high-level design and an example implementation.

### Module Design

**Objective:** 
Develop a self-evolving system that enhances its autonomy by leveraging recursive strategies, including recursive learning and adaptive feedback loops, to make intelligent decisions and optimizations.

**Key Features:**

1. **Recursive Learning Mechanism:**
   - Incorporate algorithms that utilize feedback loops to refine their processes.
   - Implement a recursive neural network (RNN) approach for continuous model training.

2. **Adaptive Feedback Loop:**
   - Design a feedback system that evaluates the performance of each module and adjusts parameters dynamically.
   - Utilize reinforcement learning for autonomous decision-making based on past experiences.

3. **Knowledge Sharing:**
   - Develop a strategy for modules within the system to share learned knowledge, improving overall system intelligence and reducing redundant learning.

4. **Scalability:**
   - Ensure the module can dynamically scale to incorporate additional data sources and computational resources.

5. **Error Handling and Recovery:**
   - Implement recursive error handling techniques for fault tolerance and system robustness.

### Example Implementation

Here's a simple skeleton of what the module might look like using Python:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from collections import deque
import random

class AutonomousModule:
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size, memory_size=100):
        self.model = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 50, 25), activation='relu', solver='adam')
        self.feedback_memory = deque(maxlen=memory_size)
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.output_size = output_size

    def update_model(self, X, y):
        """Recursive learning mechanism to update the model."""
        self.model.partial_fit(X, y)
    
    def predict(self, X):
        return self.model.predict(X)
    
    def evaluate(self, X, y):
        """Adaptive feedback to gauge performance and adjust strategy."""
        predictions = self.predict(X)
        error = mean_squared_error(y, predictions)
        self.feedback_memory.append(error)
        self.adjust_model_based_on_feedback()

    def adjust_model_based_on_feedback(self):
        """Adapting model parameters based on feedback."""
        if len(self.feedback_memory) == 0:
            return
        avg_error = np.mean(self.feedback_memory)
        if avg_error > 0.1:  # Hypothetical threshold for re-training
            self.retrain_model()
    
    def retrain_model(self):
        """Retraining model to improve performance."""
        print("Retraining model due to high error...")
        # Simulate additional retraining steps or parameter adjustments

    def share_knowledge(self, other_module):
        """Share knowledge with other modules."""
        # Transfer learned parameters or data points to another module
        pass

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_size = 10
    output_size = 1
    X_train = np.random.rand(100, input_size)
    y_train = np.random.rand(100, output_size)

    module = AutonomousModule(input_size, output_size)
    
    for _ in range(10):  # Simulate recursive learning cycles
        module.update_model(X_train, y_train)
        module.evaluate(X_train, y_train)
```

### Explanation

- **Recursive Learning:** The module uses a simple `MLPRegressor` to mimic a neural network for iterative training cycles, where the model is updated using partial fits.

- **Adaptive Feedback:** It evaluates performance using MSE and decides whether to retrain or adjust parameters based on error history stored in a `deque`.

- **Knowledge Sharing:** The module includes a placeholder for knowledge sharing, which could be expanded to share weights or training data among different modules.

- **Scalability & Robustness:** Designed to handle additional data without requiring significant structural changes, and have mechanisms for retraining when errors exceed acceptable levels.

This is a basic framework, and you would further refine it by integrating more sophisticated neural networks, error handling, and feedback processing techniques specific to the PTM empire's needs.
