Designing a new Python module for the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires integrating innovative recursive strategies into your existing system. Here’s a conceptual outline to guide you in creating a robust and flexible autonomy stack module:

### Module Overview

The new module, `RecursiveAutonomy`, focuses on enhancing the self-evolving capabilities of PTM’s autonomy stack. It incorporates recursive strategies that enable dynamic learning and adaptation over time. 

### Key Features

1. **Recursive Learning Framework**: Implement mechanisms for continuous learning cycles that enhance the autonomy system via recursive self-improvement.

2. **Adaptive Feedback Loops**: Establish recursive feedback loops to allow real-time adjustments and evolution based on environmental and operational inputs.

3. **Hierarchical Task Decomposition**: Break down complex tasks recursively into simpler sub-tasks that can be solved independently and recombined.

4. **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Employ recursive evolutionary strategies to iteratively improve decision-making processes and behavior strategies.

5. **Self-Diagnosis & Repair**: Implement recursive routines that autonomously diagnose performance issues and initiate corrective measures.

### Code Structure

```python
# RecursiveAutonomy module

from evolutionary_algorithms import EvolutionaryStrategy
from feedback_loops import AdaptiveFeedback
from task_decomposition import TaskDecomposer

class RecursiveAutonomy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.learning_rate = 0.01
        self.adaptive_feedback = AdaptiveFeedback()
        self.task_decomposer = TaskDecomposer()
        self.evolution_strategy = EvolutionaryStrategy(self.learning_rate)

    def recursive_learn(self, sensor_data, external_feedback):
        # Recursively refine understanding and model accuracy
        for cycle in range(5):  # example of 5 recursive cycles
            refined_data = self.adaptive_feedback.process(sensor_data, external_feedback)
            self.evolution_strategy.evolve(refined_data)

    def handle_task(self, complex_task):
        # Recursively decompose tasks
        sub_tasks = self.task_decomposer.decompose(complex_task)
        results = [self.execute_task(sub_task) for sub_task in sub_tasks]
        return self.combine_results(results)

    def execute_task(self, task):
        # Logic for executing a single task
        pass

    def combine_results(self, results):
        # Recursive combination of results
        pass

    def self_diagnose_and_repair(self):
        # Autonomously diagnose and repair issues
        issues_detected = self.detect_issues()
        if issues_detected:
            self.repair(issues_detected)

    def detect_issues(self):
        # Recursive detection logic
        pass

    def repair(self, issues):
        # Repair strategies
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    autonomy_system = RecursiveAutonomy()
    initial_sensor_data = {...}  # Mock data
    external_feedback = {...}    # Mock feedback
    autonomy_system.recursive_learn(initial_sensor_data, external_feedback)
```

### Implementation Details

- **Recursive Learning Framework**: Utilize machine learning models capable of recursive updates; for instance, reinforcement learning with eligibility traces.
  
- **Adaptive Feedback Loops**: Implement through sensors and actuators that adjust actions based on recursive evaluations of collected data.

- **Hierarchical Task Decomposition**: Facilitate decomposition using recursive functions or data structures like trees to handle complex tasks effectively.

- **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Leverage techniques such as genetic algorithms and neural architecture search to adapt and improve system architectures over time.

- **Self-Diagnosis & Repair**: Use recursive diagnosis routines to isolate problems and recursive repair functions to restore optimal performance.

### Considerations

- **Modularity**: Ensure each component is modular to allow easy integration and upgrades.
- **Scalability**: Design recursive strategies that can handle increasing system complexity and data loads.
- **Robustness**: Implement error-handling and fail-safe mechanisms to maintain performance during unexpected failures.
- **Performance Optimization**: Focus on optimizing recursive algorithms to reduce computational overhead and latency.

This module design aims to push the boundaries of what autonomous systems can achieve by embedding recursive and evolutionary principles at their core. Adjust specifics according to the exact requirements and architecture of the PTM empire’s existing systems.
