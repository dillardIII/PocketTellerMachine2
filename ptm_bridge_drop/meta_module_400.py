Designing a new Python module for the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves incorporating advanced artificial intelligence concepts, recursive strategies, and potentially elements of machine learning or evolutionary algorithms. Hereâ€™s an outline for designing such a module, with a focus on innovative recursive strategies:

### Module Overview
The new module, named `PTM_Evolver`, aims to enhance the PTM's autonomy stack by implementing self-evolving capabilities. The core idea is to enable the system to recursively refine its algorithms based on feedback and environmental changes.

### Key Features
1. **Recursive Learning**: Enable the system to continuously learn and adapt its strategies through recursive feedback loops.
2. **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Use genetic algorithms or nature-inspired strategies for optimization and evolution of decision-making processes.
3. **Self-monitoring and Adjustment**: Implement a mechanism that allows the system to autonomously monitor its performance and make adjustments as necessary.

### Module Design

#### 1. Recursive Learning Strategies
`RecursiveLearner` class should implement a structure whereby it repeats learning cycles with refined parameters:
```python
class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, model, data, layers=3):
        self.model = model
        self.data = data
        self.layers = layers
    
    def learn(self):
        current_data = self.data
        for i in range(self.layers):
            self.model.fit(current_data)
            performance = self.evaluate()
            current_data = self.refine_data(performance)
    
    def evaluate(self):
        # Method to evaluate model performance
        return self.model.score(self.data)

    def refine_data(self, performance):
        # Method to refine data based on performance feedback
        # This can involve data augmentation, transformation, etc.
        return modified_data
```

#### 2. Evolutionary Algorithms
Incorporate evolutionary strategies to optimize model parameters and decision-making processes.
```python
import random

class EvolutionaryOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, model, population_size=50, generations=100):
        self.model = model
        self.population_size = population_size
        self.generations = generations
    
    def evolve(self, evaluate_func):
        population = self.initialize_population()
        for generation in range(self.generations):
            fitness_scores = [evaluate_func(individual) for individual in population]
            population = self.select(population, fitness_scores)
            self.breed(population)
    
    def initialize_population(self):
        # Initialize a population with random gene values
        return [self.random_individual() for _ in range(self.population_size)]
    
    def select(self, population, fitness_scores):
        # Selection process to pick individuals for the next generation
        sorted_population = [x for _, x in sorted(zip(fitness_scores, population), reverse=True)]
        return sorted_population[:self.population_size//2]
    
    def breed(self, population):
        # Crossover and mutation to generate new individuals
        offspring = []
        while len(offspring) < self.population_size:
            parent1, parent2 = random.sample(population, 2)
            child = self.crossover(parent1, parent2)
            child = self.mutate(child)
            offspring.append(child)
        population[:] = offspring
    
    def crossover(self, parent1, parent2):
        # Crossover logic
        return (parent1 + parent2) // 2
    
    def mutate(self, individual):
        # Mutation logic to introduce new traits
        return individual * random.uniform(0.9, 1.1)

    def random_individual(self):
        # Generate a random individual (could be model parameters)
        return random.random()
```

#### 3. Self-monitoring and Adjustment
Enable the system to autonomously analyze its own performance and make necessary adjustments.
```python
class SelfMonitor:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
    
    def monitor_and_adjust(self):
        performance = self.evaluate_performance()
        if self.needs_adjustment(performance):
            self.adjust_model()

    def evaluate_performance(self):
        # Evaluate model performance
        return self.model.test_data()
    
    def needs_adjustment(self, performance):
        # Criteria to determine if adjustment is needed
        return performance < predefined_threshold
    
    def adjust_model(self):
        # Implement adjustments to the model
        self.model.adjust_parameters()

```

### Integration and Implementation
The `PTM_Evolver` module integrates each of these classes, creating a cohesive system that continuously evolves and adapts. It leverages recursive learning, evolutionary optimization, and self-monitoring to maintain and improve its autonomous decision-making capabilities.
