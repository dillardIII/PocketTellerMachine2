Designing a new Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably Meaning Perception-Transformation-Manifestation) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves seamlessly integrating recursive strategies that allow for continuous adaptation and learning. Below is a conceptual blueprint of such a module:

```python
# ptm_autonomy.py

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, state):
        self.data = data
        self.state = state
        self.children = []
        self.visited = False
    
    def add_child(self, child_node):
        self.children.append(child_node)

class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = Node("root", initial_state())
        self.current_node = self.root

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initialize the default state for root node
        return {}

    def process_data(self, data):
        # Process incoming data and transition to the next state
        new_state = transition_function(self.current_node.state, data)
        new_node = Node(data, new_state)
        self.current_node.add_child(new_node)
        self.recursive_traverse(new_node)
        
    def recursive_traverse(self, node, depth=0):
        if node.visited:
            return
        node.visited = True
        # Do something with the node (e.g., generate predictions or actions)
        action = self.action_generator(node.state)
        
        # Log traversal
        print(f"Depth {depth}: Node {node.data} with action {action}")
        
        # Apply recursion to children
        for child in node.children:
            self.recursive_traverse(child, depth + 1)

    def transition_function(self, state, data):
        # Custom transition logic to evolve the node state
        # Implement sophisticated algorithms or ML models here for transitions
        return {**state, **data}

    def action_generator(self, state):
        # Simple placeholder to illustrate action generation based on state
        action = some_complex_algorithm(state)
        return action

    def some_complex_algorithm(self, state):
        # Placeholder for complex algorithm; replace with ML models if needed
        return "perform action based on state"

    def some_recursive_strategy(self):
        # Implement a sophisticated recursive strategy for further adaptability
        # Example: running simulations, optimization tasks, or evolutionary algorithms
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ptm_stack = AutonomyStack()
    
    # Example usage with some dummy data
    example_data_stream = [{"sensor1": 10}, {"sensor2": 15}, {"sensor1": 20}]
    
    for data in example_data_stream:
        ptm_stack.process_data(data)

    # Example custom recursive strategy
    ptm_stack.some_recursive_strategy()
```

### Key Features
1. **Node-Based Architecture**: Each `Node` holds data and a `state`, with possible child nodes, allowing for a hierarchical representation of decisions and states.

2. **Dynamic State Transitions**: The module employs a `transition_function` that can be replaced by advanced machine learning models to evolve node states continuously as more data is processed.

3. **Recursive Traversal**: The `recursive_traverse` function ensures nodes are processed, actions are generated, and a potentially dynamic traversal of decision paths occurs, allowing further exploration and backtracking.

4. **Action Generation**: Actions are generated based on the evolved node state using a placeholder method (`some_complex_algorithm`).

5. **Innovative Recursive Strategies**: The `some_recursive_strategy` method is a placeholder for implementing complex recursive strategies, such as reinforcement learning loops, simulations, or evolutionary strategies for self-improvement.

This module should ideally leverage existing AI/ML frameworks to handle state transitions and action generations more dynamically, scaling to real-world applications and large datasets.
