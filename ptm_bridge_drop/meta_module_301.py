Creating a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably some autonomous technology or systems) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack is an intriguing idea. To design a module with innovative recursive strategies, we can focus on enhancing machine learning models, optimizing decision-making processes, and ensuring adaptability.

To clarify, I'll provide a simplified framework, which includes:

1. **Self-Evolving Models**: These will adapt based on incoming data without manual intervention.
2. **Recursive Feedback Loops**: To continuously improve decision-making.
3. **Meta-Learning**: Allowing the system to learn how to learn more effectively.

Here’s a basic outline for what this Python module might look like:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin, clone

class SelfEvolvingModel(BaseEstimator):
    """ A machine learning model that self-updates over time. """
    
    def __init__(self, base_model, update_interval=100):
        """
        Initialize the self-evolving model.
        
        :param base_model: The base model to evolve.
        :param update_interval: Number of samples after which the model updates.
        """
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.update_interval = update_interval
        self.model = clone(base_model)
        self.data = []  # Buffer to store incoming data
        self.labels = []

    def fit(self, X, y):
        """ Fit the model initially. """
        self.model.fit(X, y)
    
    def partial_fit(self, X, y):
        """ Update the model with new data. """
        self.data.append(X)
        self.labels.append(y)
        
        if len(self.data) >= self.update_interval:
            self._update_model()
            self.data, self.labels = [], []
    
    def _update_model(self):
        """ Update the model using the stored data. """
        X_update = np.concatenate(self.data)
        y_update = np.concatenate(self.labels)

        # Here you could employ any meta-learning strategy to update the model
        self.model.partial_fit(X_update, y_update)
    
    def predict(self, X):
        """ Make predictions with the current model. """
        return self.model.predict(X)

class RecursiveLearner:
    """ A meta-learning strategy that incorporates recursive feedback. """
    
    def __init__(self, initial_model, iterations=5, metric=None):
        """
        Initialize the recursive learner.
        
        :param initial_model: The initial self-evolving model.
        :param iterations: Number of recursive iterations.
        :param metric: Function to evaluate performance.
        """
        self.initial_model = initial_model
        self.iterations = iterations
        self.metric = metric

    def fit(self, X, y):
        """ Fit the model iteratively, refining over recursive cycles. """
        best_model = self.initial_model
        best_score = -np.inf

        for i in range(self.iterations):
            print(f"Iteration {i+1}/{self.iterations}")

            # Split data
            X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

            # Fit and assess current model
            current_model = clone(best_model)
            current_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
            predictions = current_model.predict(X_val)
            score = self.metric(y_val, predictions)
            
            print(f"Score: {score}")

            # Update if improvement
            if score > best_score:
                best_score = score
                best_model = current_model
    
        self.final_model = best_model

    def predict(self, X):
        """ Predict using the recursively refined model. """
        return self.final_model.predict(X)

# Usage Example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

    # Load dataset
    data = load_boston()
    X, y = data.data, data.target

    # Select base model
    base_model = DecisionTreeRegressor()

    # Initialize the self-evolving model
    evolving_model = SelfEvolvingModel(base_model, update_interval=50)

    # Recursive strategy with feedback loops
    learner = RecursiveLearner(evolving_model, iterations=3, metric=mean_squared_error)
    
    # Fit and predict
    learner.fit(X, y)
    predictions = learner.predict(X)

    print(f"Final MSE: {mean_squared_error(y, predictions)}")
```

### Key Features:

- **Self-Evolving Model**: Uses a buffer to accumulate data and incrementally updates the model, enabling adaptability to new patterns.
- **Recursive Learner**: Iteratively refines models through predefined cycles, sharpening predictions based on performance feedback.
- **Meta-Learning & Feedback Loop**: Allows the system to improve its learning strategy itself, by using feedback to adjust its learning parameters.

### Enhancements:

1. **Distributed Processing**: Implement parallel processing to handle large data streams efficiently.
2. **Adaptive Memory Management**: Integrate strategies for managing memory to avoid data overflow while retaining critical information.
3. **Advanced Meta-Learning Techniques**: Incorporate techniques like network morphism or automated machine learning for model selection.

This module provides a foundation for building an advanced self-evolving autonomy stack which can be tailored to meet specific requirements within the PTM empire. For a production environment, consider additional features like logging, exception handling, and integration with cloud-based machine learning pipelines.
