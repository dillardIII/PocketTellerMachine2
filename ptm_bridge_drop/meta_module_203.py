Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional or specific to a context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a structured approach combining advanced artificial intelligence techniques, software design principles, and recursive strategies. Hereâ€™s a conceptual design of such a module:

### Module Name: `auto_evolve`

The `auto_evolve` module utilizes recursive strategies to enable self-improvement in machine learning models or systems, continually refining their parameters, structure, and strategies based on feedback and autonomous discovery.

#### Key Components:

1. **Recursive Strategy Layer (`RecursiveStrategy`):**
   - **Objective:** Enable systems to iteratively refine and improve their performance through self-assessment and recursive learning.
   - **Core Functions:**
     - `evaluate_performance()`: Assesses current model/systems against set benchmarks or dynamic goals.
     - `recursive_optimize()`: Employs recursive algorithms, like recursive neural networks or hierarchical Bayesian optimization, to refine model parameters.
     - `self_tune()`: Dynamically adjusts the strategic objectives based on past iterations and contextual changes.

2. **Dynamic Feedback Loop (`FeedbackController`):**
   - **Objective:** Integrate a loop that ensures continuous feedback for improvement.
   - **Core Functions:**
     - `collect_feedback()`: Gathers internal and external performance metrics, user feedback, and environmental interactions.
     - `analyze_feedback()`: Uses AI techniques like sentiment analysis, clustering, or natural language processing to extract actionable insights from feedback.
     - `feedback_to_strategy()`: Translates feedback into potential strategy modifications using established decision rules or machine learning.

3. **Autonomous Model Evolution (`ModelEvolution`):**
   - **Objective:** Facilitate autonomous model evolution by introducing new algorithms, techniques, or structures.
   - **Core Functions:**
     - `generate_candidates()`: Uses genetic algorithms or neural architecture search to propose new model variants.
     - `evaluate_candidates()`: Tests new candidates against existing solutions using controlled experiments or simulations.
     - `select_best()`: Selects the most promising model variant based on evaluation, integrating it into production or system settings.

4. **Meta-Learning Component (`MetaLearner`):**
   - **Objective:** Learn how to learn by leveraging meta-learning techniques.
   - **Core Functions:**
     - `meta_train()`: Trains models to adapt quickly to new tasks or environments by using meta-learning algorithms.
     - `transfer_knowledge()`: Facilitates knowledge transfer from learned tasks to new or more complex tasks efficiently.
     - `meta_strategy_update()`: Uses insights from meta-learning outcomes to update overall autonomy strategies.

5. **Monitoring & Reporting (`Monitor`):**
   - **Objective:** Provide scalability and robustness through constant monitoring and reporting.
   - **Core Functions:**
     - `track_metrics()`: Continuously monitors performance, resource utilization, and other vital metrics.
     - `generate_reports()`: Creates detailed reports on system evolution and performance to inform stakeholders.
     - `alert_on_anomalies()`: Triggers alerts when anomalies or significant performance drops occur.

#### Example Usage:

```python
from auto_evolve import RecursiveStrategy, FeedbackController, ModelEvolution, MetaLearner, Monitor

# Initialize Components
recursive_strategy = RecursiveStrategy()
feedback_controller = FeedbackController()
model_evolution = ModelEvolution()
meta_learner = MetaLearner()
monitor = Monitor()

# Start the Self-Evolving Process
monitor.track_metrics()

for cycle in range(100):  # Example loop for recursive improvement cycles
    current_performance = recursive_strategy.evaluate_performance()
    
    if feedback_controller.collect_feedback():
        feedback_controller.analyze_feedback()
        feedback_controller.feedback_to_strategy()
    
    recursive_strategy.recursive_optimize()
    model_evolution.generate_candidates()
    model_evolution.evaluate_candidates()
    best_model = model_evolution.select_best()
    
    meta_learner.meta_train()
    meta_learner.transfer_knowledge()
    meta_learner.meta_strategy_update()
    
    monitor.generate_reports()
    if monitor.alert_on_anomalies():
        print("Anomaly detected. Engaging human oversight.")

```

### Innovative Aspects:
- **Recursive and Meta-Learning Integration**: Combines recursive optimization with meta-learning for enhanced evolution.
- **Dynamic Feedback Loop**: Constantly evolves based on real-time feedback.
- **Autonomous Evolution**: Uses cutting-edge AI tech to autonomously generate and evaluate new strategies.

The design encourages flexibility and scalability, making it suited for complex autonomy stacks in various applications or organizational needs. Fine-tuning and customization would be necessary based on specific domain requirements and goals.
