Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (presumably an advanced autonomous system's control stack) with self-evolving capabilities requires us to consider various aspects such as self-improvement, recursive learning, adaptability, and system integration. Below is a conceptual framework for such a module, emphasizing recursive strategies for evolutionary growth.

### Module: `ptm_self_evolver`

```python
# ptm_self_evolver.py

import random
import logging

# Import necessary machine learning and optimization libraries
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
import numpy as np

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

class SelfEvolver:
    def __init__(self, data, labels, init_model=None):
        """
        Initialize the SelfEvolver class with data, labels, and an optional initial model.
        :param data: The input data for training and evaluation.
        :param labels: The corresponding labels for the data.
        :param init_model: An optional initial machine learning model to start with.
        """
        self.data = data
        self.labels = labels
        self.model = init_model if init_model else MLPClassifier(max_iter=200)
        
    def evolve(self, max_iterations=10, improvement_threshold=0.01):
        """
        Evolve the model by iteratively refining it using recursive strategies.
        :param max_iterations: Maximum number of iterations for evolution.
        :param improvement_threshold: Minimum improvement required to continue evolution.
        :return: Evolved model with improved performance.
        """
        # Split initial data into training and testing sets
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(self.data, self.labels, test_size=0.2)
        
        current_performance = 0
        for iteration in range(max_iterations):
            logging.info(f"Evolution Iteration {iteration+1}")
        
            # Train the current model
            self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
            predictions = self.model.predict(X_test)
            performance = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
            improvement = performance - current_performance
            
            logging.info(f"Current Model Performance: {performance}, Improvement: {improvement}")
            
            if improvement < improvement_threshold:
                logging.info("Minimal improvement achieved; stopping evolution.")
                break
            
            # Use a recursive strategy to self-optimize
            self._recursive_improvement()
            current_performance = performance
        
        return self.model
    
    def _recursive_improvement(self):
        """
        A private method to implement recursive improvement strategies.
        Consider tweaking hyperparameters, architecture, or augmentation.
        """
        logging.info("Performing recursive improvements.")
        
        # Randomly adjust hyperparameters as a rudimentary evolutionary strategy
        new_hidden_layer_sizes = tuple([random.randint(10, 100) for _ in range(random.randint(1, 3))])
        new_learning_rate_init = random.uniform(0.001, 0.01)

        self.model.set_params(hidden_layer_sizes=new_hidden_layer_sizes, 
                              learning_rate_init=new_learning_rate_init)
        
        logging.info(f"New Parameters: hidden_layer_sizes={new_hidden_layer_sizes}, learning_rate_init={new_learning_rate_init}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Hypothetical dataset for demonstration
    fake_data = np.random.rand(1000, 10)  # 1000 samples, 10 features
    fake_labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)  # Binary labels

    self_evolver = SelfEvolver(data=fake_data, labels=fake_labels)
    evolved_model = self_evolver.evolve(max_iterations=20, improvement_threshold=0.01)

    logging.info("Evolved model parameters:")
    logging.info(evolved_model.get_params())
```

### Key Features:
- **Recursive Improvement**: The `_recursive_improvement()` method randomly adjusts model hyperparameters such as the network's hidden layer sizes and learning rate. This is an example of a simple form of evolutionary strategy which can be expanded to include more sophisticated techniques like automated architecture search.
- **Self-evolving Models**: The `SelfEvolver` class embodies the concept of a self-improving algorithm, seeking better performance through iterative training and adaptation.
- **Robust Logging**: Use of logging to keep track of the model's iterative improvements and parameter changes, aiding in debugging and iteration tracking.

### Future Enhancements:
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Implement more advanced recursive optimization strategies like genetic algorithms for model evolution.
- **Augmentation Strategies**: Include data augmentation techniques to enhance learning during the evolvement process.
- **Integration with Larger System**: Design APIs to seamlessly integrate with other PTM stack components for real-time, autonomous system adaptation.

This design provides a solid foundation for building an advanced, autonomous, and self-sustaining PTM system.
