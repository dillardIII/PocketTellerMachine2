Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional or context-specific entity here) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves several considerations, including architecture design, recursive strategy definition, adaptability, and self-improvement capabilities. Below is a high-level outline and an example of how you might implement such a module:

### Overview and Requirements

1. **Modular Design**: The module should be modular, allowing for easy integration and expansion.
2. **Self-Evolving Capabilities**: Implement recursion and self-improvement strategies.
3. **Adaptability**: Allow the system to adapt to new data and scenarios over time.
4. **Monitoring and Feedback Loops**: Continuous monitoring and feedback for learning from interactions.
5. **Simplicity and Readability**: Ensure the code remains simple and readable for maintainability.

### Core Components

1. **Data Processing Layer**: Handles data input, cleaning, and preprocessing.
2. **Recursive Logic Module**: Implements recursive algorithms for adaptation and improvement.
3. **Autonomy Decision Engine**: Utilizes input data and recursive strategies to make decisions.
4. **Feedback and Learning Module**: Learns from output and feedback to refine strategies.
5. **Interface Layer**: Facilitates communication with other systems or users.

### Implementation

Here's an illustrative Python module layout including a basic implementation of recursive strategies and self-adaptability:

```python
import random
import logging
from typing import List, Callable, Any

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class DataProcessor:
    def preprocess(self, data: Any) -> List[float]:
        logger.info("Preprocessing data: %s", data)
        # Simplified dummy preprocessing
        return [float(x) for x in data if isinstance(x, (int, float))]

class RecursionStrategy:
    def recursive_improvement(self, data: List[float], depth: int = 0, max_depth: int = 3) -> float:
        if depth >= max_depth or len(data) <= 1:
            return sum(data) / len(data) if data else 0
        logger.info("Recursive step %d with data: %s", depth, data)
        mid = len(data) // 2
        left = self.recursive_improvement(data[:mid], depth + 1, max_depth)
        right = self.recursive_improvement(data[mid:], depth + 1, max_depth)
        improved = (left + right) / 2
        logger.info("Improvement at depth %d: %f", depth, improved)
        return improved

class DecisionEngine:
    def make_decision(self, score: float) -> str:
        logger.info("Making decision with score: %f", score)
        # Simplified decision logic
        return "Proceed" if score > 50 else "Review"

class FeedbackModule:
    def learn_from_feedback(self, decision: str, feedback: str) -> None:
        logger.info("Learning from decision: %s, Feedback: %s", decision, feedback)
        # Simplified feedback processing
        # Real implementation would adjust strategies/weights

class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_processor = DataProcessor()
        self.recursion_strategy = RecursionStrategy()
        self.decision_engine = DecisionEngine()
        self.feedback_module = FeedbackModule()
    
    def process(self, raw_data: Any):
        # Full process cycle
        processed_data = self.data_processor.preprocess(raw_data)
        score = self.recursion_strategy.recursive_improvement(processed_data)
        decision = self.decision_engine.make_decision(score)
        self.feedback_module.learn_from_feedback(decision, random.choice(["Positive", "Negative"]))
        return decision

if __name__ == "__main__":
    raw_data = [random.randint(0, 100) for _ in range(20)]  # Dummy data
    autonomy_stack = AutonomyStack()
    decision = autonomy_stack.process(raw_data)
    logger.info("Final decision: %s", decision)
```

### Highlights and Considerations

- **Recursive Strategy**: `RecursiveStrategy` class uses recursion to break down and improve data assessment.
- **Feedback Loop**: Feedback is used to simulate learning. This example is overly simplified; in a true system, it would adjust model parameters or policy.
- **Modularity**: Each component is independent and focused on a specific function, allowing for future expansion and refinement.

### Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Integrate machine learning models for enhanced decision-making and adaptive learning.
2. **Sophisticated Feedback Systems**: Implement reinforcement learning or other ML techniques to dynamically adjust strategies based on feedback.
3. **Scenario Simulations**: Use simulations for testing recursive strategies under various conditions to optimize performance.

This setup provides a starting framework. Youâ€™ll need to refine it further based on specific requirements and contexts of your self-evolving autonomous system.
