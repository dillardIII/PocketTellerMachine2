Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional entity for this context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack could be an intriguing challenge. To achieve this, we'll focus on creating a framework that emphasizes innovative recursive strategies aimed at enhancing autonomy and adaptability. 

Hereâ€™s a high-level description and a basic implementation outline for the module:

### Module Name: `autonomy_expander`

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Self-Evolving Algorithms**: Algorithms that can improve themselves over time through recursive strategies and self-evaluation.
2. **Recursive Learning**: Implementing recursive neural networks or reinforcement learning techniques where the model can continuously refine its strategies.
3. **Adaptive Interfaces**: Enable modules to interconnect in diverse ways based on contextual requirements.
4. **Feedback Loops**: Empower the system to autonomously create feedback loops that permit continuous development and adjustment.

#### Components:

1. **Data Loader**: Efficiently acquire and preprocess data inputs.
2. **Recursive Strategy Engine**: Central hub for implementing recursive models and learning strategies.
3. **Autonomous Evaluator**: A mechanism for ongoing assessment and refinement of AI models.
4. **Interface Adapter**: Connects the module with other systems in a flexible manner.
5. **Resource Manager**: Manages computational resources, prioritizing tasks dynamically.
   
```python
# autonomy_expander/__init__.py

import numpy as np
from collections import deque

class DataLoader:
    def __init__(self, source):
        self.source = source

    def load_data(self):
        # Placeholder for real data loading logic
        return np.random.rand(100, 10)  # Simulating a 100x10 dataset

class RecursiveStrategyEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = []

    def add_model(self, model):
        self.models.append(model)

    def recursive_learn(self, data):
        # Example of recursive learning implementation through mock-up function calls
        for model in self.models:
            model.update(data)  # Assume models have an update method for learning

class AutonomousEvaluator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_logs = deque(maxlen=100)

    def evaluate(self, model, data):
        # Simplified evaluation function
        performance = model.evaluate(data)  # Assume models have an evaluate method
        self.performance_logs.append(performance)
        return performance

    def refine(self, model):
        # Example of adaptive refinement based on feedback from evaluations
        if np.mean(self.performance_logs) < 0.8:  # Assuming 0.8 is a threshold
            model.refine()

class InterfaceAdapter:
    def __init__(self, interfaces):
        self.interfaces = interfaces

    def adapt(self, context):
        # Quick logic to select the right interface given a context
        return self.interfaces.get(context, None)

class ResourceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.resources = {}

    def allocate(self, task):
        # Simplified allocation logic
        self.resources[task] = "Allocated"

    def prioritize(self, task, priority):
        # Implement complex prioritization logic
        self.resources[task] = f"Allocated with priority {priority}"

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    data_loader = DataLoader("path/to/data")
    data = data_loader.load_data()

    engine = RecursiveStrategyEngine()
    evaluator = AutonomousEvaluator()
    resource_manager = ResourceManager()

    # Mockup example of model usage
    class MockModel:
        def update(self, data):
            pass

        def evaluate(self, data):
            return np.random.rand()

        def refine(self):
            pass

    model = MockModel()
    engine.add_model(model)

    engine.recursive_learn(data)
    evaluator.evaluate(model, data)
    evaluator.refine(model)

    resource_manager.allocate("TaskA")
    resource_manager.prioritize("TaskA", 5)
```

#### Explanation:

- **DataLoader** provides functionality to load and preprocess data, which is crucial for any learning system.
- **RecursiveStrategyEngine** serves as the core for recursive learning methodologies, allowing models to self-enhance over iterations.
- **AutonomousEvaluator** continually evaluates model performance and triggers refinement processes, leveraging feedback loops.
- **InterfaceAdapter** allows dynamic connections between modules and external systems based on contextual requirements.
- **ResourceManager** dynamically manages computational resources, ensuring efficient and prioritized resource allocation.

This basic framework serves as a preliminary foundation which should be expanded with domain-specific algorithms, error handling, advanced logging, better model implementations, and a more sophisticated adaptive system in practical use.
