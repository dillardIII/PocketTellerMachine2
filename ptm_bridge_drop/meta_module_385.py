Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably PTM refers to a hypothetical organization focused on autonomous technologies) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack is a complex task, incorporating cutting-edge concepts in artificial intelligence, software engineering, and systems design. Below is a high-level outline along with some conceptual ideas for such a module. This architecture leverages recursive strategies, enabling adaptive behavior and progressive self-improvement.

### Overview

The module, named `AutoPTM`, focuses on recursive learning and dynamic decision-making to enhance autonomous functions. Key components include Adaptive Learning Models, Feedback Loops, and Recursive Optimization.

### Module Components

1. **Adaptive Learning Models**:
   - **Description**: Implement models that can adapt and learn from new data over time without human intervention.
   - **Methodology**:
     - Utilize Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable the system to learn policies that improve over iterations.
     - Incorporate Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for automatic tuning of model architectures.

2. **Feedback Loops**:
   - **Description**: Create a systematic approach for feedback that allows the system to continuously improve.
   - **Strategies**:
     - Establish both short-term and long-term feedback loops to assess the performance and adapt behaviors.
     - Implement recursive neural networks (RNNs) to process input sequences and detect patterns or anomalies.

3. **Recursive Optimization**:
   - **Description**: Use recursive strategies for optimizing decision-making processes.
   - **Techniques**:
     - Deploy recursive function approximators to iteratively improve decision boundaries.
     - Integrate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with deep learning to recursively explore action spaces.

4. **Self-Monitoring**:
   - **Description**: Develop mechanisms to enable self-monitoring and diagnostics.
   - **Components**:
     - Implement diagnostic agents that employ unsupervised anomaly detection to identify system failures or sub-optimal performance.
     - Use recursive self-assessment algorithms to evaluate model integrity and autonomy.

### Implementation Plan

Below is a high-level overview of the implementation:

#### Dependencies:

- `numpy`: For basic numerical operations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `tensorflow/pytorch`: For deep learning model development.
- `gym`: For building and testing RL environments.

#### Sample Code Structure

```python
# AutoPTM Module

# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from gym import spaces, Env

# Define the Adaptive Learning Model class
class AdaptiveLearningModel:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize neural networks and RL algorithms
        pass

    def train(self, data):
        # Training logic for the model
        pass

# Define Feedback Loop class
class FeedbackLoop:
    def __init__(self):
        # Set up feedback logic
        pass
        
    def feedback(self, performance_data):
        # Process and respond to feedback
        pass

# Define Recursive Optimization class
class RecursiveOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize optimization tools
        pass

    def optimize(self, decision_data):
        # Recursive optimization logic here
        pass

# Main AutoPTM class orchestrating the module
class AutoPTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.al_model = AdaptiveLearningModel()
        self.feedback_loop = FeedbackLoop()
        self.recursive_optimizer = RecursiveOptimizer()

    def run(self, input_data):
        # Main execution logic
        performance_data = self.al_model.train(input_data)
        self.feedback_loop.feedback(performance_data)
        self.recursive_optimizer.optimize(performance_data)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    auto_ptm_system = AutoPTM()
    some_input_data = np.random.rand(100, 10)  # Dummy input data
    auto_ptm_system.run(some_input_data)
```

### Conclusion

The `AutoPTM` module is designed to provide a robust framework for advancing self-evolving autonomous systems. By using recursive strategies in learning, feedback, and optimization, the module can continuously improve itself and adapt to new challenges, fostering a truly autonomous stack for the PTM empire. Future work might involve leveraging federated learning for decentralized data and model updates or integrating with edge computing for low-latency decision-making.
