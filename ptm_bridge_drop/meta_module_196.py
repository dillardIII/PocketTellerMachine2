To design a new Python module aimed at expanding the PTM (Presumably a Placeholder Name for an Empire-like entity) empireâ€™s self-evolving autonomy stack, we need to focus on creating a system that supports intelligent decision-making, adaptability, and learning. The module should incorporate recursive strategies, leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning paradigms. Below is a conceptual design and partial code implementation that outlines a potential solution.

### Conceptual Design

1. **Self-Evolving Architecture:** 
   - Incorporate machine learning algorithms to facilitate continuous learning and adaptation.
   - Utilize feedback loops to refine decisions and processes over time.

2. **Recursive Strategy Framework:**
   - Develop recursive functions to decompose complex problems into simpler, more manageable tasks.
   - Implement dynamic programming techniques for optimizing decision-making processes.

3. **Modular Structure:**
   - Design with interchangeable components which can be updated independently as newer technologies are developed.
   - Support plug-and-play functionality for adding new features or algorithms.

4. **Autonomy and Decentralization:**
   - Implement decentralized decision-making processes to enhance scalability and robustness.
   - Use agent-based models where each agent can operate independently and make decisions.

5. **Data-Driven Decision Making:**
   - Utilize big data analytics to gather insights and make informed decisions.
   - Develop features for data aggregation, cleaning, and preprocessing.

### Partial Code Implementation

Below is a Python module sketch that incorporates some of the concepts described above:

```python
import numpy as np
import random
from typing import List, Any, Callable

# Recursive strategy components
def recursive_optimizer(problem_space: List[Any], evaluate: Callable, depth: int) -> Any:
    # Base case: If reached maximum depth, terminate the recursion
    if depth == 0:
        return random.choice(problem_space)  # Random choice as a simple strategy
    
    # Evaluate all potential moves
    evaluations = [evaluate(option) for option in problem_space]
    
    # Select top moves to explore further
    top_moves = select_top_k(problem_space, evaluations, k=3)
    
    # Recursively optimize deeper layers
    results = [recursive_optimizer(top_moves, evaluate, depth - 1) for move in top_moves]
    
    # Return the best result found
    best_result = max(results, key=evaluate)
    return best_result

def select_top_k(options: List[Any], evaluations: List[float], k: int) -> List[Any]:
    # Pair options with evaluations
    paired = list(zip(options, evaluations))
    # Sort based on evaluations, descending
    paired.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    # Return the top k options
    top_k = [p[0] for p in paired[:k]]
    return top_k

# Adaptive Learning Module
class SelfEvolvingAgent:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate: float):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.history = []

    def learn(self, state: Any, reward: float):
        self.history.append((state, reward))
        # Implement more sophisticated learning logic here

    def make_decision(self, problem_space: List[Any]) -> Any:
        # Use the recursive optimizer to make a decision
        return recursive_optimizer(problem_space, self.evaluate_option, depth=3)

    def evaluate_option(self, option: Any) -> float:
        # Implement a logic to evaluate options, could be heuristic or learned
        return random.uniform(0, 1)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = SelfEvolvingAgent(learning_rate=0.1)
    problem_space = ['Option1', 'Option2', 'Option3', 'Option4']
    
    decision = agent.make_decision(problem_space)
    print(f"Selected Decision: {decision}")
```

### Explanation

- **Recursive Strategy:** Implemented in the `recursive_optimizer` function that receives a problem space and recursively finds optimal solutions by evaluating top options.
- **Adaptive Learning Module:** The `SelfEvolvingAgent` class simulates an agent capable of learning from its environment, optionally integrating more complex ML models in the future.
- **Evaluate and Decision Making:** Provides a placeholder evaluation function `evaluate_option`, which should be replaced with a more accurate model tailored to specific use cases.

This design and code outline serve as a starting point which can be further expanded with additional complexity, such as integrating real-time data streams, deploying on a distributed system architecture, or implementing specific machine learning algorithms tailored to your exact needs.
