Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical company or project) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a highly adaptable and intelligent system that can evolve its capabilities autonomously. Here, I'll provide a conceptual overview and some code snippets to illustrate how you might structure such a module, with a focus on innovative recursive strategies.

### Key Concepts

1. **Recursive Learning & Adaptation**: Implement recursive strategies that allow the system to continually refine and optimize its algorithms.

2. **Modular Architecture**: Ensure each component or capability is modular, easily updatable, and replaceable.

3. **Multi-agent Collaboration**: Integrate a multi-agent system where agents communicate and collaborate to improve the overall performance.

4. **Self-Monitoring & Healing**: Incorporate mechanisms for self-monitoring and self-healing to enhance reliability.

5. **Knowledge Sharing**: Implement a knowledge base where learned strategies and experiences are stored and accessed by different modules.

### Module Structure

```python
# File: ptm_autonomy.py

class AutonomousAgent:
    def __init__(self, id, strategy):
        self.id = id
        self.strategy = strategy
        self.performance_history = []

    def learn(self, environment):
        """Recursively refine strategy based on environment feedback."""
        feedback = environment.get_feedback(self.strategy)
        self._update_strategy(feedback)
        self.performance_history.append(feedback)

    def _update_strategy(self, feedback):
        """Private method to recursively update strategy."""
        # Implement the logic for strategy refinement
        self.strategy = self.strategy.evolve(feedback)
        print(f"Agent {self.id} updated strategy.")

class Strategy:
    def __init__(self, parameters):
        self.parameters = parameters

    def evolve(self, feedback):
        """Evolve strategy based on feedback."""
        # Recursive logic to evolve parameters
        new_parameters = [p * feedback for p in self.parameters]
        return Strategy(new_parameters)

class Environment:
    def get_feedback(self, strategy):
        """Simulate feedback based on a given strategy."""
        # Implement complex feedback logic based on environment simulation
        return sum(strategy.parameters)  # Simple placeholder logic

class KnowledgeBase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategy_repository = []

    def store(self, strategy):
        """Store successful strategies."""
        self.strategy_repository.append(strategy)
        print("Strategy stored in KnowledgeBase.")

    def retrieve_optimal(self):
        """Retrieve the most successful strategies."""
        # Logic to retrieve optimal strategies based on performance history
        return max(self.strategy_repository, key=lambda s: sum(s.parameters))

class AutonomyManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = []
        self.knowledge_base = KnowledgeBase()

    def deploy_agent(self, id, initial_strategy):
        agent = AutonomousAgent(id, initial_strategy)
        self.agents.append(agent)
        print(f"Agent {id} deployed.")

    def run_simulation(self, environment, iterations):
        for _ in range(iterations):
            for agent in self.agents:
                agent.learn(environment)
                self.knowledge_base.store(agent.strategy)

# Example Usage

def main():
    # Initialize the autonomy manager
    manager = AutonomyManager()

    # Deploy agents with initial strategies
    initial_strategy = Strategy([0.5, 0.8, 0.3])
    manager.deploy_agent(1, initial_strategy)

    # Create environment
    env = Environment()

    # Run simulation to let agents evolve
    manager.run_simulation(env, 10)

    # Retrieve optimal strategies
    optimal_strategy = manager.knowledge_base.retrieve_optimal()
    print(f"Optimal strategy parameters: {optimal_strategy.parameters}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Components

1. **AutonomousAgent**: Represents an agent with the capability to learn and evolve its strategy recursively.

2. **Strategy**: Encapsulates the parameters defining agent behavior, with an evolve method for self-refinement.

3. **Environment**: Provides feedback based on current strategies, simulating real-world interactions.

4. **KnowledgeBase**: Stores and retrieves strategies based on their historical performance.

5. **AutonomyManager**: Manages the agents and coordinates the learning and deployment processes.

### Innovations

- Recursive strategy refinement allows agents to autonomously adapt to their environment.
- Multi-agent architecture with a shared knowledge base promotes collaborative learning and optimization.
- Self-healing capabilities could be further developed to ensure agents recover from sub-optimal states.

This design can be the foundation for a highly scalable and adaptive autonomy stack aimed at evolving intelligently in complex environments.
