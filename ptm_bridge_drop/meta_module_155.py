Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional empire) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves a combination of advanced AI techniques, recursive strategies, and a highly modular architecture. The following is a conceptual outline of how such a Python module could be structured:

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy`

#### 1. Core Components

- **Recursive Strategy Engine (`strategy_engine.py`)**: This component is designed to recursively analyze and optimize strategies by learning from past decisions and outcomes using reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms.

- **Self-Evolving Neural Networks (`neural_evolver.py`)**: Implements neural networks that autonomously evolve over time. This can include techniques like NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) or Evolutionary Strategies (ES).

- **Data Acquisition & Management (`data_manager.py`)**: Handles real-time data acquisition and adaptive data pipelines that adjust based on new data influx and changing patterns.

- **Predictive Analysis (`predictive_analytics.py`)**: Uses machine learning models to forecast and predict outcomes based on current and historical data. Can include time-series forecasting and anomaly detection.

#### 2. Recursive Strategies

- **Self-Optimization**: Introduce a meta-learning layer where the module not only learns optimal strategies but also recursively evaluates its learning process to continuously improve efficiency.

- **Resource Allocation**: Recursive strategy allocation for optimal resource utilization across the empire's operations. Can be implemented using a combination of operations research techniques and AI scheduling algorithms.

- **Scenario Simulation**: Integrate a simulation environment to test various strategies in a sandbox mode. This can be done using Monte Carlo simulations combined with game theory.

```

#### 4. Key Features

- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with the increase in data and complexity. Implement distributed processing using frameworks like Dask or Spark.

- **Modularity**: Each component is modularized for easy updates and maintenance without impacting other components.

- **Security and Robustness**: Implement security features to protect data integrity and incorporate redundancy to ensure robustness.

- **Interoperability**: Open APIs for easy integration with existing systems and protocols within the PTM empire.

#### 5. Example Usage

```python
from ptm_autonomy import StrategyEngine, DataManager, NeuralEvolver

# Initialize components
strategy_engine = StrategyEngine()
data_manager = DataManager()
neural_evolver = NeuralEvolver()

# Acquire and process new data
data_manager.acquire_data()
data_manager.process_data()

# Optimize strategies based on new insights
strategy_engine.optimize_strategy(data_manager)

# Evolve neural networks for better decision-making
neural_evolver.evolve_network(strategy_engine)

# Predict future trends
predictions = PredictiveAnalytics().forecast_outcomes(data_manager)

print(predictions)
```

This is a high-level overview, and each component would require detailed implementation tailored to specific goals and constraints of the PTM empire's operations.
