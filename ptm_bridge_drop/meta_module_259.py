Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "Peripheral and Transport Management") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a thoughtful approach to implementing recursive strategies for autonomous decision-making, learning, and adaptation. Here's a conceptual design for a Python module that leverages innovative recursive strategies:

```python
# File: autonomy_stack.py

import random
import logging

class AutonomousEntity:
    def __init__(self, id, initial_state):
        self.id = id
        self.state = initial_state
        self.history = []
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

    def evaluate_state(self):
        # Evaluate the current state and assign a score
        score = self.state.get('efficiency', 0) * random.uniform(0.8, 1.2)
        logging.info(f"Evaluated state with score: {score}")
        return score

    def evolve(self):
        # Implement recursive self-improvement strategy
        for _ in range(5):  # Recursive depth setting
            self.history.append(self.state.copy())
            score = self.evaluate_state()
            if score < 50:  # Arbitrary threshold for initiating change
                self.modify_state(score)
            else:
                return score

    def modify_state(self, score):
        # Recursive strategy to modify state
        change_factor = random.uniform(0.1, 0.5)
        self.state['efficiency'] *= (1 + change_factor)
        self.state['complexity'] = self.state.get('complexity', 1) * (1 - change_factor)
        logging.debug(f"Modified state to: {self.state}")

    def decide_action(self):
        # Decide next action based on current state
        action_score = self.evolve()
        if action_score > 70:  # Another arbitrary threshold
            action = 'expand'
        else:
            action = 'consolidate'
        logging.info(f"Decided to: {action} with action score: {action_score}")
        return action

class AutonomyManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.entities = {}

    def add_entity(self, id, initial_state):
        entity = AutonomousEntity(id, initial_state)
        self.entities[id] = entity
        logging.debug(f"Added new entity with ID: {id}")

    def run_simulation(self):
        for id, entity in self.entities.items():
            logging.info(f"Running simulation for entity ID: {id}")
            decision = entity.decide_action()
            self.perform_action(id, decision)

    def perform_action(self, id, decision):
        logging.info(f"Performing action: {decision} for entity ID: {id}")
        # Implement logic depending on the action, e.g., updating database, signal handling, etc.
        if decision == 'expand':
            # Code to handle expansion
            logging.debug(f"Entity {id} expands.")
        elif decision == 'consolidate':
            # Code to handle consolidation
            logging.debug(f"Entity {id} consolidates.")
```

### Key Features of the Module:

1. **Autonomous Entities**: Each `AutonomousEntity` simulates parts of the PTM empire with self-evolution capabilities based on recursive evaluation and modification of the entity's state.

2. **Recursive Evolution**: The `evolve` function triggers recursive self-improvement by modifying the entity state when certain conditions are met, simulating learning and evolution over time.

3. **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Decisions are made based on the evolved state of the entity, moving between actions like 'expand' or 'consolidate' based on arbitrary scores.

4. **Simulation and Management**: The `AutonomyManager` orchestrates multiple entities, facilitating centralized control over the simulation and decision-making processes.

5. **Logging**: The module heavily uses logging for debugging and tracing workflow, crucial for recursive and autonomous systems to ensure transparency and traceability.

### Potential Enhancements:

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Incorporate ML models for evaluating states more effectively and refining the scoring mechanism.
- **Network Communication**: Enable entities to communicate and collaborate, bringing another layer of complexity and realism as found in real autonomous systems.
- **Interactive Interfaces**: Add dashboards or command-line interfaces for monitoring and controlling simulations dynamically.

This module sets a foundation for expanding the PTM's self-evolving autonomy stack with recursive strategies and is adaptable for further development and integration of more sophisticated AI components.
