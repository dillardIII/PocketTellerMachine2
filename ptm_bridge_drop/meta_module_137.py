Creating a Python module to expand a hypothetical self-evolving autonomy stack for the PTM (Presumably an Advanced AI Entity) empire is an ambitious task. I will outline a concept focusing on recursive strategies that could potentially meet your requirements. The module should encourage the system to learn, adapt, and evolve autonomously through recursive and iterative functionalities. 

### Module Name: `recursive_autonomy`

#### Key Features:

1. **Recursive Learning:**
   - Implement feedback loops where the system can reassess its performance and optimize strategies accordingly.
   
2. **Self-Modification:**
   - Use genetic programming techniques to enable self-modification, allowing the system to alter its own code.

3. **Dynamic Resource Allocation:**
   - Implement mechanisms to recursively adjust resources based on current needs and performance.

4. **Automated Hypothesis Testing:**
   - Allow the system to construct and evaluate new hypotheses to improve its decision-making processes.

5. **Memory Management:**
   - Create a recursive memory model that can optimize data storage based on usage patterns.

Here is a conceptual implementation of the module:

```python
import random
import copy

class Node:
    def __init__(self, state, parent=None):
        self.state = state
        self.parent = parent
        self.children = []
    
    def add_child(self, child):
        self.children.append(child)

class RecursiveAutonomy:
    def __init__(self, initial_state):
        self.root = Node(initial_state)
        self.current_node = self.root
    
    def recursive_learn(self, state_evaluator, iterations=100):
        """Recursively learns and self-modifies to reach optimal state."""
        for _ in range(iterations):
            best_child = max(self.current_node.children, key=state_evaluator, default=None)

            if best_child is None or state_evaluator(best_child) < state_evaluator(self.current_node):
                new_state = self.generate_candidate_state()
                new_node = Node(new_state, self.current_node)
                self.current_node.add_child(new_node)
                self.current_node = new_node
            else:
                self.current_node = best_child
            
            print(f"Current Optimal State: {self.current_node.state}")
    
    def generate_candidate_state(self):
        """Generates a new random state - represents self-modification."""
        # Example state modification logic
        return random.randint(0, 100)
    
    def evaluate_state(self, node):
        """A baseline evaluation for each state."""
        # Example: aims for a state value closest to 50
        return -abs(node.state - 50)
    
    def adaptive_resource_allocation(self):
        """Recursively adjusts resources."""
        print("Adapting resources based on node states...")
        # This could involve scaling server instances, allocating memory, etc.
    
    def hypothesis_testing(self):
        """Automates the generation and testing of hypotheses."""
        print("Generating and testing new hypotheses...")
        # Generate and evaluate hypotheses for system improvement
    
    def manage_memory(self):
        """Recursively optimizes memory use."""
        print("Managing memory based on usage patterns...")
        # could involve garbage collection, caching strategies, etc.

# Example usage
autonomy_system = RecursiveAutonomy(initial_state=0)
autonomy_system.recursive_learn(autonomy_system.evaluate_state)
autonomy_system.adaptive_resource_allocation()
autonomy_system.hypothesis_testing()
autonomy_system.manage_memory()
```

### Explanation:

- **Node Class:** Represents each state, including state transitions through parent-child relationships.
- **Recursive Learning:** This function attempts to evolve the system towards an optimal state by exploring different paths and selecting the best-performing node based on a state evaluation function.
- **Candidate State Generation:** Simulates self-modification by generating new potential states.
- **Adaptive Resource Allocation & Memory Management:** Placeholder functions for concepts that would dynamically allocate resources and manage memory based on state and usage.
- **Automated Hypothesis Testing:** Encourages the creation of new strategies or solutions based on current data.

This module is a starting point that can be further enhanced with more sophisticated algorithms and real-world scenarios to create a more robust self-evolving autonomy system.
