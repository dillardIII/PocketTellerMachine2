Designing a Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably a fictional entity, given the context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves several key considerations. You'd want to focus on self-improvement, adaptability, and the ability to handle complex, dynamic environments. Below is a schematic outline of how such a module might be structured:

```python
# Filename: ptm_autonomy_stack.py

import random
import logging
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Setting up the logger for debug purposes
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

class AutonomousAgent(ABC):
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = self.initialize_state()

    @abstractmethod
    def initialize_state(self):
        """Initialize the state for the agent."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def perceive(self, environment):
        """Perceive the current environment."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def decide(self):
        """Decide the next action based on current state and perception."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def act(self):
        """Perform an action based on the decision."""
        pass

    def self_evolve(self):
        """Allow the agent to improve its strategy recursively."""
        logging.debug("Self-evolution activated.")
        improvement_factor = random.uniform(0.1, 1.0)
        self.state = self.recursive_strategy(improvement_factor)

    @abstractmethod
    def recursive_strategy(self, improvement_factor):
        """Define a recursive strategy to improve the agent."""
        pass

class LearningAgent(AutonomousAgent):
    def initialize_state(self):
        # Initialize a simple state
        return {"knowledge": 1, "efficiency": 1}

    def perceive(self, environment):
        # Perception logic
        self.environment_data = environment.get_data()
        logging.debug(f"Perceiving environment: {self.environment_data}")

    def decide(self):
        # Decision logic based on perceived environment
        decision = random.choice(["action1", "action2", "action3"])
        logging.debug(f"Deciding on action: {decision}")
        return decision

    def act(self):
        # Act based on decision
        decision = self.decide()
        logging.debug(f"Acting on decision: {decision}")
        # Here should be the logic to interact with the environment

    def recursive_strategy(self, improvement_factor):
        # Recursive strategy implementation
        logging.debug(f"Applying recursive strategy with factor: {improvement_factor}")
        # An innovative recursive strategy that incrementally improves the state
        new_knowledge = self.state["knowledge"] + (improvement_factor * self.state["knowledge"])
        new_efficiency = self.state["efficiency"] + (improvement_factor * self.state["efficiency"])
        logging.debug(f"Updated state - Knowledge: {new_knowledge}, Efficiency: {new_efficiency}")
        return {"knowledge": new_knowledge, "efficiency": new_efficiency}

class Environment:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def get_data(self):
        return self.data

def run_autonomous_system():
    # Example execution of the stack
    environment = Environment("Initial Environment Data")
    agent = LearningAgent()

    for _ in range(10):  # Running 10 iterations as an example
        agent.perceive(environment)
        agent.act()
        agent.self_evolve()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_autonomous_system()
```

**Key Features:**
1. **Abstract Base Class `AutonomousAgent`:** Lays the foundation for all autonomous agents with methods for perception, decision-making, action, and self-evolution.
2. **Innovative Recursive Strategy:** Implemented within the method `recursive_strategy` of the `LearningAgent`, which enhances the agent's "knowledge" and "efficiency" iteratively using a random improvement factor.
3. **Debug Logging:** Facilitates tracking the agent's state changes and decision-making processes, helpful during development and debugging.
4. **Environment Interaction:** The `Environment` class allows agents to interact with their surroundings, demonstrating a basic sense-and-act loop.

To truly implement this part of a self-evolving autonomy stack, you'd expand the methods and environments with real-world data and complex logics suitable for the tasks PTM agents are expected to handle.
