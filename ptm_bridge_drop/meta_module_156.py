Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional abbreviation, but for the sake of this task, we'll assume it stands for Potential Technical Management) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves leveraging recursive algorithms, machine learning, and robust systems design principles. Here's a conceptual outline to guide the development of such a module.

### Overview:
The module, `ptm_autonomy`, will feature a collection of tools and algorithms designed to enhance the autonomy stack of PTM's systems through recursive strategies and self-evolving mechanisms.

### Key Components:
1. **Recursive Learning Framework**:
    - Utilize recursive algorithms to refine models based on continuous feedback.
    - Implement meta-learning techniques to improve learning efficiency over time.

2. **Self-Optimization Engine**:
    - Develop algorithms that automatically optimize parameters through recursive trials and analysis.
    - Utilize evolutionary strategies to simulate natural selection and survival of the fittest algorithms.

3. **Autonomous Decision-making Unit**:
    - Create a decision-making engine that can recursively evaluate past decisions and outcomes to enhance future choices.
    - Incorporate reinforcement learning to enable systems to learn optimal policies through exploration and exploitation.

4. **Adaptive Control System**:
    - Design a control system that can adjust its controllers recursively based on changing environments.
    - Use feedback loops to recursively update control laws and strategies.

5. **Recursive Data Analysis Tools**:
    - Implement recursive data reduction techniques to filter and focus on critical data points only.
    - Use recursive clustering or classification for anomaly detection and pattern recognition.

### Implementation Details:

```python
# Initial Skeleton of the ptm_autonomy Module

class RecursiveLearningFramework:
    def __init__(self, models):
        """Initialize with a list of model candidates."""
        self.models = models

    def recursive_training(self, data, epochs=10):
        """Train models recursively using the provided data."""
        # Pseudocode for recursive training
        for model in self.models:
            for _ in range(epochs):
                model.train(data)
                # Recursively refine
                data = self._refine_data(data, model)
    
    def _refine_data(self, data, model):
        """Refine data based on model performance."""
        # Pseudocode for data refinement
        refined_data = some_data_refinement_logic(data, model)
        return refined_data

class SelfOptimizationEngine:
    def __init__(self, parameters):
        """Initialize with a list of parameters to optimize."""
        self.parameters = parameters
    
    def optimize(self):
        """Optimize parameters recursively."""
        # Implement evolutionary strategies
        best_configuration = self._evolutionary_strategy(self.parameters)
        return best_configuration
    
    def _evolutionary_strategy(self, parameters):
        """Simulate natural selection."""
        # Pseudocode for evolutionary strategy
        evaluated_params = evaluate_parameters(parameters)
        best = select_best(evaluated_params)
        return best

class AutonomousDecisionMakingUnit:
    def __init__(self, decision_tree):
        """Initialize with a decision tree or policy structure."""
        self.decision_tree = decision_tree

    def make_decision(self, state):
        """Make decisions recursively."""
        # Example recursive decision-making
        if not self._is_terminal(state):
            next_state = self._evaluate_options(state)
            return self.make_decision(next_state)
        return self.decision_tree.resolve(state)
    
    def _evaluate_options(self, state):
        """Evaluate options to decide next state."""
        return some_next_state_logic(state)

class AdaptiveControlSystem:
    def __init__(self, control_laws):
        """Initialize with a set of control laws."""
        self.control_laws = control_laws

    def adjust_controls(self, feedback):
        """Adjust controls recursively based on feedback."""
        for law in self.control_laws:
            law.update(feedback)
            # Recursive update strategy
            self.control_laws = self._recursive_adjustment(self.control_laws, feedback)
    
    def _recursive_adjustment(self, laws, feedback):
        """Recursively adjust control laws."""
        for law in laws:
            law.tenor *= feedback.evaluation
        return laws

# Other classes such as RecursiveDataAnalysisTools can follow similar structures.

```

### Considerations:

- **Scalability**: Ensure that the recursive strategies are computationally efficient to handle large-scale problems.
- **Robustness**: Incorporate fail-safe mechanisms to handle unexpected errors encountered during recursive processes.
- **Interoperability**: Design the module to be easily integrated with existing systems.

This structured approach will help in building a highly autonomous and adaptive system for PTM that can evolve continuously through recursive enhancements.
