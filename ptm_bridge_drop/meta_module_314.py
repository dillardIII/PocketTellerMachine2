Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a Placeholder for a specific Autonomous Navigation Empire) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves designing sophisticated recursive strategies for autonomous decision-making, learning, and adaptation. Here’s a high-level outline for such a module, highlighting innovative recursive strategies:

### Module: PTM_SelfEvolving_Autonomy

#### Features:
1. **Recursive Learning Framework**:
   - Implement self-learning algorithms that evolve through recursive updates.
   - Use neural networks or decision trees that improve with each cycle, incorporating feedback loops.

2. **Behavior Cloning with Recursion**:
   - Clone human-like decisions recursively by continuously retraining models on new behavior data.
   - Use reinforcement learning to adapt cloned behaviors to evolving environments.

3. **Adaptation Layer**:
   - Include an adaptation layer that allows recursive self-adjustment based on sensor feedback.
   - Use techniques like online learning to adapt rapidly to dynamic changes.

4. **Recursive Planning Algorithms**:
   - Employ recursive planning methods such as A* or Dijkstra’s algorithm with iterative deepening.
   - Use fractal planning approaches to break down complex tasks into manageable fractal-like sub-tasks.

5. **Multimodal Sensor Fusion**:
   - Combine data from multiple sensors recursively to achieve comprehensive situational awareness.
   - Employ Markov models or Kalman filters that adapt recursively as new sensor data becomes available.

6. **Self-Healing Protocols**:
   - Implement recursive self-diagnosis and self-repair mechanisms to enhance system robustness.
   - Utilize an introspective AI layer that continuously examines and corrects for faults.

7. **Recursive Optimization Techniques**:
   - Optimize resource usage, such as battery life and processing power, using recursive algorithms.
   - Recursive simulations to predict and improve energy efficiencies and task completion times.

#### Example Code Snippet

Below is a conceptual example of what a portion of the recursion strategy might look like:

```python
class RecursiveAutonomy:

    def __init__(self, initial_model):
        self.model = initial_model
        self.sensor_data = []

    def update_model(self, new_data):
        # Recursively update model with new data
        self.model.train(new_data)
        self.log_recursion(new_data)

    def log_recursion(self, data):
        # Log the data used recursive updates for analysis
        print("Recursively updated model with: ", data)

    def adapt_to_environment(self, sensor_input):
        self.sensor_data.append(sensor_input)
        predicted_actions = self.model.predict(sensor_input)
        
        # Adaptation through recursive optimization
        optimized_actions = self.recursive_optimize(predicted_actions)
        self.execute_actions(optimized_actions)

    def recursive_optimize(self, actions):
        # Dummy implementation of a recursive optimization technique
        for i in range(len(actions)):
            actions[i] = self.optimize_action(actions[i])
        return actions

    def optimize_action(self, action):
        # Hypothetical optimization logic
        return action * 0.9  # Assume some optimization factor

    def execute_actions(self, actions):
        # Execute planned actions with feedback consideration
        for action in actions:
            print("Executing action:", action)
            # Further recursive feedback logic here

# Example usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    initial_model = SomePretrainedModel()  # Placeholder for an actual model
    autonomy_system = RecursiveAutonomy(initial_model)
    
    # Simulate receiving new sensor data
    autonomy_system.adapt_to_environment("New Sensor Data Point")
```

### Considerations:
- **Scalability**: Ensure that the recursive algorithms scale efficiently with increased data inputs.
- **Robustness**: Implement safety measures to handle unexpected errors during recursion.
- **Testing**: Continuous testing is crucial to ensure recursive improvements are beneficial.

This design offers a framework for enhancing an autonomy stack with recursive strategies, facilitating continuous self-improvement and adaptation, which are vital for complex and dynamic environments. This kind of recursive architecture allows the system to learn, adapt, and optimize autonomously over time.
