Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "PTM" refers to something specific within the context of the question, but for the sake of this example, let's assume it stands for a fictional organization focused on autonomous systems) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a detailed and thoughtful approach. Hereâ€™s a conceptual design that incorporates innovative recursive strategies:

### Overview
The new module, called `AutoSeed`, will focus on self-improvement and recursive learning to enhance autonomous capabilities. It will feature a multi-layered strategy involving data collection, self-assessment, adaptation, and improvement loops that can be recursively applied.

### Key Components

1. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - **Sensor Integration**: Aggregates data from various sensors in an autonomous system.
   - **Environment Monitoring**: Continuous collection of contextual data (e.g., weather, terrain).

2. **Self-Assessment Layer**:
   - **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate current performance using predefined metrics.
   - **Behavioral Analysis**: Examine decision-making processes and outcomes.

3. **Adaptive Strategy Layer**:
   - **Recursive Learning**: Employ techniques like recursive neural networks and evolutionary strategies to enhance capabilities.
   - **Goal Re-Evaluation**: Periodically reassess objectives based on the latest data and performance analyses.

4. **Improvement Layer**:
   - **Algorithmic Optimization**: Use genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning for continuous improvement.
   - **Submodule Refinement**: Automatically refine submodules for specific tasks (e.g., navigation, obstacle avoidance).

5. **Communication Layer**:
   - **Inter-Module Collaboration**: Facilitate communication and data sharing between different modules of the autonomy stack.
   - **Cloud Update Integration**: Utilize cloud infrastructure for updating capabilities and sharing improvements across distributed systems.

6. **Safety and Ethics Layer**:
   - **Ethical Decision-Making**: Integrate frameworks for ethical AI to ensure decisions align with human values.
   - **Fail-Safe Protocols**: Ensure safety by implementing fallback algorithms in case of failure.

### Recursive Strategies

**Recursive Deep Learning**:
- Utilize recursive neural networks (RNNs) to process sequences of data for pattern recognition and decision-making enhancement.
- Design custom recursive functions to leverage historical data in training and prediction processes.

**Feedback Loop System**:
- Implement closed-loop feedback systems where outcomes of actions are continuously integrated back into the system to inform future decisions.

**Evolutionary Strategies**:
- Implement algorithms that simulate evolution to optimize decision-making processes. Use techniques such as mutation, crossover, and selection to evolve strategies over time.

### Python Implementation

```python
class AutoSeed:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_collector = DataCollector()
        self.self_assessor = SelfAssessor()
        self.adaptive_strategy = AdaptiveStrategy()
        self.improvement_module = ImprovementModule()
        self.communication_layer = CommunicationLayer()
        self.safety_protocols = SafetyProtocols()

    def run(self):
        # Main loop for self-evolving autonomy
        while True:
            data = self.data_collector.collect()
            assessment = self.self_assessor.evaluate(data)
            adaptation = self.adaptive_strategy.formulate(assessment)
            improvement = self.improvement_module.execute(adaptation)
            self.communication_layer.sync(improvement)
            self.safety_protocols.ensure_safety()

class DataCollector:
    def collect(self):
        # Code to collect data from sensors
        pass

class SelfAssessor:
    def evaluate(self, data):
        # Code to assess performance
        pass

class AdaptiveStrategy:
    def formulate(self, assessment):
        # Code to create adaptive strategies
        pass

class ImprovementModule:
    def execute(self, adaptation):
        # Code to implement improvement strategies
        pass

class CommunicationLayer:
    def sync(self, updates):
        # Code to manage inter-module communications
        pass

class SafetyProtocols:
    def ensure_safety(self):
        # Code to enforce safety and ethical standards
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    auto_seed = AutoSeed()
    auto_seed.run()
```

This module forms a foundation for recursive, self-improving autonomous systems, supporting continuous learning and optimization. The design emphasizes adaptability and safety, critical in autonomous system development.
