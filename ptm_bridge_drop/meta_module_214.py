Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional or specified concept related to autonomy) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack can be quite an ambitious task. Below is a rough overview of how you might design such a module using innovative recursive strategies. This summary will focus on concepts that could be broken down into various components for a self-evolving system.

### Module Overview

The module `ptm_autonomy` will be designed with components capable of recursive learning, decision-making, and adaptation. It will employ advanced machine learning techniques, use recursive structures and patterns, and ensure the system is scalable, adaptable, and self-improving.

```python
# ptm_autonomy.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class SelfEvolvingNode:
    """
    Represents a node in the self-evolving system.
    Each node can represent an autonomous agent or a decision point.
    """

    def __init__(self, data, labels):
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier()
        self.data = data
        self.labels = labels
        self.trained = False

    def train(self):
        logging.info(f"Training node with data size: {len(self.data)}")
        self.model.fit(self.data, self.labels)
        self.trained = True

    def predict(self, sample):
        if not self.trained:
            raise Exception("Model is not trained yet.")
        return self.model.predict(np.array(sample).reshape(1, -1))

    def recursive_improve(self, feedback_data, feedback_labels):
        """
        Recursively improves the model based on feedback.
        """
        logging.info("Recursively improving the node.")
        self.data = np.append(self.data, feedback_data, axis=0)
        self.labels = np.append(self.labels, feedback_labels, axis=0)
        self.train()


class SelfEvolvingSystem:
    """
    Represents the overall self-evolving system that orchestrates nodes.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = []

    def add_node(self, data, labels):
        node = SelfEvolvingNode(data, labels)
        node.train()
        self.nodes.append(node)
        logging.info(f"Added new node, total nodes count: {len(self.nodes)}")

    def decision(self, samples):
        """
        Makes decisions based on weighted aggregation of node predictions.
        """
        aggregate_predictions = np.zeros((len(samples),), dtype=int)        
        for node in self.nodes:
            predictions = node.predict(samples)
            aggregate_predictions += predictions
        return aggregate_predictions / len(self.nodes)

    def run_autonomy_cycle(self, feedback_data, feedback_labels):
        """
        Runs a cycle of self-improvement across all nodes.
        """
        for node in self.nodes:
            node.recursive_improve(feedback_data, feedback_labels)


# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    initial_data = np.random.rand(100, 10)  # Example features
    initial_labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)  # Example binary labels

    ptm_system = SelfEvolvingSystem()
    
    # Initialize the system with one node
    ptm_system.add_node(initial_data, initial_labels)
    
    sample_data = np.random.rand(1, 10)  # Example single sample
    decision = ptm_system.decision(sample_data)
    logging.info(f"Decision for the sample: {decision}")

    # Example feedback to improve the system further
    feedback_data = np.random.rand(10, 10)
    feedback_labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 10)
    ptm_system.run_autonomy_cycle(feedback_data, feedback_labels)
```

### Key Features

- **Recursive Learning:** Each `SelfEvolvingNode` trains its model and recursively improves based on new feedback. This ensures constant adaptation in light of new data and circumstances.
  
- **Node Architecture:** The `SelfEvolvingSystem` maintains a collection of autonomous nodes. Each node functions independently and contributes to the collective decision-making process.

- **Decision Aggregation:** Predictions from all nodes are aggregated to form a single decision, allowing a consensus-based approach.

- **Dynamic Expansion:** New nodes can be added to the system, allowing it to grow and manage increased complexity.

- **Feedback Mechanism:** The system uses feedback to evolve recursively, ensuring that it adapts to new patterns or environments over time.

This is a foundational framework, and in practice, such an autonomy stack would likely also include reinforcement learning, neural networks for complex task handling, and further integration with data pipelines for seamless operation in various environments.
