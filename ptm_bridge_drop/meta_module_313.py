To design a Python module that expands the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies, we can incorporate concepts from machine learning, recursive algorithms, and self-adaptive systems. We'll focus on creating a framework that facilitates the self-evolution of tasks and learning models using recursive strategies, ensuring that the system can improve and adapt over time. Here's an outline of the module, which I'll refer to as `self_evolving_stack`.

### Module: `self_evolving_stack`

#### Key Features:
1. **Model Repository**: A collection of machine learning models that can be dynamically created, updated, and replaced.
2. **Recursive Task Management**: A task scheduler that recursively optimizes and prioritizes tasks based on past performance and predicted outcomes.
3. **Self-Adaptation Engine**: An engine that iteratively refines its strategies and models using feedback loops.
4. **Data-Driven Feedback**: Continuous ingestion of data to fuel the recursive learning and adaptation processes.
5. **Exploration-Exploitation Balance**: Implements strategies like epsilon-greedy or UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) to balance exploration of new strategies with exploitation of known successful strategies.

#### Core Classes and Functions:

1. **Model Repository (`ModelRepo`)**:
    - Stores and manages machine learning models.
    - Allows dynamic loading, removal, and replacement of models.

    ```python
    class ModelRepo:
        def __init__(self):
            self.models = {}

        def add_model(self, name, model):
            self.models[name] = model

        def get_model(self, name):
            return self.models.get(name)

        def remove_model(self, name):
            del self.models[name]
    ```

2. **Recursive Task Management (`TaskManager`)**:
    - Manages tasks and optimizes them recursively.
    - Prioritizes tasks based on past performance and prediction.

    ```python
    class Task:
        def __init__(self, name, perform_fn, priority=0):
            self.name = name
            self.perform_fn = perform_fn
            self.priority = priority

        def perform(self):
            result = self.perform_fn()
            # Update priority based on result
            self.priority = self.update_priority(result)
            return result

        def update_priority(self, result):
            # Implement priority update logic here
            return self.priority + result

    class TaskManager:
        def __init__(self):
            self.tasks = []

        def add_task(self, task):
            self.tasks.append(task)

        def prioritize_tasks(self):
            self.tasks.sort(key=lambda t: t.priority, reverse=True)

        def execute_tasks(self):
            while self.tasks:
                task = self.tasks.pop(0)
                task.perform()
                self.add_task(task)
    ```

3. **Self-Adaptation Engine (`AdaptationEngine`)**:
    - Implements feedback loops for self-improvement.
    - Refines strategies based on cumulative experience.

    ```python
    class AdaptationEngine:
        def __init__(self, model_repo, task_manager):
            self.model_repo = model_repo
            self.task_manager = task_manager

        def refine_models(self):
            # Implement model refinement strategies here
            pass

        def execute(self):
            self.task_manager.prioritize_tasks()
            self.task_manager.execute_tasks()
            self.refine_models()
    ```

4. **Data Ingestion (`DataIngestion`)**:
    - Responsible for continuously supplying data to the system.

    ```python
    class DataIngestion:
        def __init__(self, source):
            self.source = source

        def fetch_data(self):
            # Implement data fetching logic
            return self.source.get_data()
    ```

5. **Exploration-Exploitation (`StrategyBalancer`)**:
    - Balances exploration and exploitation strategies.
  
    ```python
    class StrategyBalancer:
        def __init__(self, initial_exploration_rate=0.1):
            self.exploration_rate = initial_exploration_rate

        def choose_strategy(self, strategies):
            # Implement exploration-exploitation logic here
            pass

        def update_exploration_rate(self, performance):
            # Dynamically update exploration rate based on performance
            pass
    ```

### Workflow:

1. **Initialize**:
   - Set up `ModelRepo`, `TaskManager`, `AdaptationEngine`, and `DataIngestion`.
   - Load initial set of models and tasks.

2. **Data Gathering**:
   - Use `DataIngestion` to continuously obtain new data.

3. **Task Execution**:
   - Employ `TaskManager` to manage and execute tasks recursively.

4. **Self-Adaptation**:
   - Use `AdaptationEngine` to refine models and strategies in a feedback loop.

5. **Strategy Optimization**:
   - `StrategyBalancer` tunes exploration-exploitation based on ongoing results.

This design provides a flexible and extensible framework for the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack. Additional features, such as logging, performance monitoring, or integration with cloud services for model deployment, can be incorporated to further enhance the module's capabilities.
