Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably an acronym for something specific to your domain) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies can be a complex but fascinating task. Below is a high-level design, including strategic components and example code snippets that can serve as a starting point.

### Module: `PTM_Autonomy`

This module will leverage recursive strategies to enable autonomous agents to learn, adapt, and optimize their behaviors in dynamic environments. The goal is to create a self-evolving system that continually enhances its capabilities.

#### Key Components

1. **Recursive Learning Engine**: Continuously refines models by re-training on new data and feedback loops.
   
2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Utilizes recursive algorithms to assess and improve decision strategies over time.
   
3. **Dynamic Environment Modeling**: Recursively updates environment models based on new interactions and data.
   
4. **Feedback Loop Integration**: Incorporates results back into the learning pipeline to inform future iterations.

5. **Scalability Framework**: Ensures the system can handle increased complexity by leveraging modular architecture.

#### Recursive Strategies

- **Recursive Neural Networks**: Utilize structures like RNNs or LSTMs in novel ways for pattern recognition and decision-making.
  
- **Dynamic Programming**: Implement recursive dynamic programming techniques for optimization and problem-solving.
  
- **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning**: Employ recursive decomposition of tasks to simplify learning in complex environments.

#### Example Code Snippets

Below is an example showcasing a recursive learning function:

```python
import numpy as np

class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, model, initial_data):
        self.model = model
        self.data = initial_data

    def recursive_train(self, max_iterations=10):
        # Initial training
        self.model.train(self.data)
        
        for iteration in range(max_iterations):
            # Generate new data based on model predictions
            new_data = self.generate_data_from_predictions()
            
            # Update data
            self.data.update(new_data)
            
            # Re-train model on the updated data
            self.model.train(self.data)
            
            print(f"Iteration {iteration+1}/{max_iterations} complete.")
    
    def generate_data_from_predictions(self):
        # Placeholder for generating data
        # In practice, this would involve running simulations or real-world interactions
        return np.random.rand(10, self.data.shape[1])  # Example placeholder

# Example usage
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

initial_data = np.random.rand(100, 10)  # Random initial data
model = LinearRegression()

learner = RecursiveLearner(model, initial_data)
learner.recursive_train(max_iterations=5)
```

### Implementation Considerations

- **Data Management**: Efficient handling of large datasets and integration of streaming data sources.
  
- **Performance Optimization**: Profiling and optimization to ensure scalability and efficiency.
  
- **Safety and Ethics**: Implementing guardrails to ensure autonomous behaviors align with ethical standards and safety requirements.

- **Explainability**: Providing transparency and interpretability for decision-making processes.

### Advanced Extensions

- **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: Recursive search and adjustment of model hyperparameters.
  
- **Cross-Domain Learning**: Integration of knowledge from multiple domains to enhance learning efficiency.
  
- **Distributed Learning**: Employing distributed computing to handle complex models and large datasets.

This high-level design and example provide a starting point for creating an autonomy stack with recursive strategies. As you develop this module further, you'll likely need to tailor the structures and algorithms to the specific needs and goals of the PTM empire.
