Designing a Python module to expand the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves implementing innovative strategies that leverage recursive techniques and autonomous systems design principles. Let's outline a conceptual module with core components and strategies.

```python
# ptm_autonomy.py

import random
import logging


class SelfEvolvingAutonomy:
    def __init__(self, initial_state):
        self.state = initial_state
        self.evolution_history = []
        self.recursion_depth = 0
        self.max_recursion_depth = 10  # Arbitrary limit to ensure termination

    def evaluate_state(self):
        """Evaluate the current state and return a performance metric."""
        # Example: performance metric based on some criteria (e.g., efficiency, resource usage)
        return random.uniform(0, 1)

    def mutate_system(self):
        """Introduce random mutations to the system to evolve."""
        mutation = random.choice(['increase', 'decrease', 'alter'])
        if mutation == 'increase':
            self.state += 1
        elif mutation == 'decrease':
            self.state -= 1
        else:
            self.state = random.randint(0, 100)  # Alter completely
        logging.info(f"Mutated state to {self.state} using {mutation}")

    def recursive_evolve(self, depth=0):
        """Recursively evolve the system to optimize performance."""
        self.recursion_depth = depth
        if depth > self.max_recursion_depth:
            logging.warning("Max recursion depth reached.")
            return

        current_performance = self.evaluate_state()
        self.mutate_system()
        new_performance = self.evaluate_state()
        
        logging.info(f"Depth {depth}: Current Performance {current_performance}, New Performance {new_performance}")

        if new_performance > current_performance:
            logging.info(f"Improvement detected at depth {depth}. Recursing...")
            self.evolution_history.append((depth, self.state, new_performance))
            self.recursive_evolve(depth + 1)
        else:
            logging.info(f"No improvement at depth {depth}. Rolling back...")

    def get_evolution_history(self):
        """Get the history of evolution to analyze progression."""
        return self.evolution_history


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    
    initial_state = 50
    autonomy_instance = SelfEvolvingAutonomy(initial_state)
    autonomy_instance.recursive_evolve()

    print("Evolution History:")
    for history in autonomy_instance.get_evolution_history():
        print(f"Depth: {history[0]}, State: {history[1]}, Performance: {history[2]:.4f}")
```

### Key Features of the Module:

1. **Recursive Evolution**:
   - Implements a recursive approach to simulate system evolution based on performance metrics. This recursive strategy allows the system to explore and exploit various state changes for optimization.

2. **Randomized Mutations**:
   - Introduces randomness in the system's mutation process, allowing the system to explore diverse solutions. This can be critical in optimizing complex systems where manual tuning isn't feasible.

3. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Uses a simple evaluation metric (`evaluate_state`) to gauge the system's performance. This metric can be expanded to include more sophisticated evaluation strategies like reward-based mechanisms.

4. **Evolution History Recording**:
   - Keeps a history of all significant changes and improvements, which aids in understanding the evolution trajectory and deciding on future strategy adjustments.

5. **Configurable Recursion Depth**:
   - The module allows control over the recursion depth, preventing excessive iterations that might lead to resource exhaustion.

This module represents a foundational step towards creating a self-evolving autonomous system that can adapt and optimize itself over time. Further enhancements could include using machine learning algorithms for more sophisticated state evaluations, integrating real-world data, and dynamically adjusting max recursion depth based on system capacity and performance trends.
