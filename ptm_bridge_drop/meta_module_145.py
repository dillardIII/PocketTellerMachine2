Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a conceptual entity for a self-evolving autonomy stack) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a focus on recursion and adaptability. Below, Iâ€™ll outline a high-level design of such a Python module that incorporates recursive strategies to enhance autonomy and adaptability.

### Module Overview: PTM_Autonomy_Enhancer

**Objective**: Create a self-evolving autonomy stack that leverages recursive strategies for decision-making, learning, and adaptation.

#### Key Components:
1. **Recursive Decision Engine**: Self-refining decision-making that improves through recursive feedback loops.
2. **Adaptive Learning Module**: Incorporates machine learning models that recursively enhance themselves based on historical performance and changing environments.
3. **Environment Simulator**: A recursive simulation mechanism to predict and adapt to different scenarios.
4. **Feedback Analysis Unit**: Continuously analyzes feedback recursively to optimize system performance.
  
### Core Design

```python
# ptm_autonomy_enhancer.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

class RecursiveDecisionEngine:
    def __init__(self, iterations=10):
        self.iterations = iterations
    
    def recursive_decision(self, data, model):
        """Use recursive strategies to refine decisions."""
        refined_decision = None
        for _ in range(self.iterations):
            # Recursive feedback loop to refine the decision
            prediction = model.predict(data)
            refined_decision = self._optimize_decision(prediction)
        return refined_decision
    
    def _optimize_decision(self, prediction):
        # Mock optimization logic - should be replaced with actual heuristic
        return prediction * np.random.choice([0.9, 1.1], size=prediction.shape)

class AdaptiveLearningModule:
    def __init__(self, model=RandomForestClassifier(), epochs=5):
        self.model = model
        self.epochs = epochs
    
    def train_model_recursively(self, features, targets):
        """Train the model with recursive self-improvement."""
        for epoch in range(self.epochs):
            X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, targets, test_size=0.2)
            self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
            score = self.model.score(X_test, y_test)
            print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}/{self.epochs} accuracy: {score}')
            # Mock adaptation logic to enhance the model - tweak parameters based on performance feedback
            # e.g., Adjust model parameters, feature set, learning method

class EnvironmentSimulator:
    def execute_scenario(self, initial_conditions, timesteps):
        """Simulate different scenarios to adapt strategies."""
        state = initial_conditions
        for t in range(timesteps):
            state = self._simulate_next_state(state, t)
            print(f"State at timestep {t}: {state}")
        return state
    
    def _simulate_next_state(self, state, timestep):
        # Mock simulation logic - should be replaced with actual environment dynamics
        return state * (1 + np.sin(timestep))

class FeedbackAnalysisUnit:
    def analyze_feedback(self, feedback_data):
        """Recursively analyze feedback to optimize future performance."""
        improvements = []
        for i, data_point in enumerate(feedback_data):
            improved = self._process_feedback(data_point)
            improvements.append(improved)
            print(f"Feedback {i} improved: {improved}")
        return improvements
    
    def _process_feedback(self, data_point):
        # Mock processing logic to evolve feedback
        return data_point * np.random.choice([0.8, 1.2])

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize components
    decision_engine = RecursiveDecisionEngine()
    learning_module = AdaptiveLearningModule()
    simulator = EnvironmentSimulator()
    feedback_unit = FeedbackAnalysisUnit()
    
    # Mock data for demonstration purposes
    dummy_features = np.random.rand(100, 5)
    dummy_targets = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=100)

    # Run recursive training
    learning_module.train_model_recursively(dummy_features, dummy_targets)
    
    # Run scenario simulation
    initial_conditions = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    simulator.execute_scenario(initial_conditions, timesteps=5)
    
    # Analyze feedback
    feedback_data = np.random.rand(10)
    feedback_unit.analyze_feedback(feedback_data)
```

### Explanation of Recursive Strategies

- **Recursive Decision Engine**: Applies a recursive loop to improve decisions, which could involve layers of decision refinement and feedback integration.
  
- **Adaptive Learning Module**: Trains models with recursive refinement. The model's learning process is iteratively improved through recursive feedback from prior performance evaluations.

- **Environment Simulator**: Implements recursive predictions of state evolution, refining environmental strategies through scenario analysis.

- **Feedback Analysis Unit**: Continuously analyzes feedback to recursively optimize performance, adapting future actions based on past results.

### Exploration and Consideration

- **Integration with AI Frameworks**: Consider using advanced AI frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for more robust model training and deployment.
  
- **Real-world Data**: Extend the module with hooks for real-world data feeds, ensuring continuous integration and adaptation.

- **Scalability and Parallelization**: Design recursive processes that can be distributed and parallelized to handle large-scale operations efficiently.

This architecture fosters an advanced self-evolving autonomy system that continuously improves itself through recursive strategies making it adaptive and scalable across multiple domains.
