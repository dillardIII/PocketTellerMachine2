Designing a new Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably a fictional or proprietary entity) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves creating a system that can adapt and optimize itself autonomously. This module should leverage recursive strategies to continuously improve performance and decision-making.

Below is a conceptual outline of such a module:

1. **Module Overview**:
    - **Name**: `ptm_autonomy_stack`
    - **Purpose**: To enhance the autonomy stack of the PTM empire by using recursive strategies that enable self-evolving capabilities. The module will focus on adaptive learning, decision-making, and optimization.

2. **Key Components**:

    - **Recursive Learning Engine**:
      - Utilizes techniques such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) that can recursively optimize policies and operations.
      - Implements a recursive feedback loop where the output of one iteration serves as the input for the next, continually refining performance.

    - **Self-optimization Framework**:
      - Uses a modular design where components can autonomously assess and improve their functions.
      - Employs meta-learning techniques to adapt learning strategies based on performance feedback.

    - **Adaptive Decision-making System**:
      - Incorporates probabilistic models and decision trees that revise strategies based on past outcomes.
      - Features a planning mechanism that recursively evaluates different scenarios over time to make more informed decisions.

3. **Core Features**:

    - **Recursive Data Processing**:
      - Handles data streams and performs recursive data aggregation and refinement to improve accuracy over time.
      - Leverages both historical and real-time data for model training and predictions.

    - **Autonomous Model Evolution**:
      - Automatically evolves models by testing various strategies and iterating over them for better adaptability.
      - Applies evolutionary strategies to spawn multiple variations of models and select the most promising ones.

4. **Implementation Sketch**:

```python
# ptm_autonomy_stack.py

import numpy as np

class PTMAutonomyStack:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = []
        self.data = []

    def recursive_learning(self, state, action_space):
        # Basic structure for implementing a recursive learning approach
        rewards = self.evaluate_policies(state)
        improved_policy = self.optimize_policy(rewards, action_space)
        return improved_policy

    def evaluate_policies(self, state):
        # Placeholder for evaluating different policies
        return np.random.random(len(self.models))
    
    def optimize_policy(self, rewards, action_space):
        # Recursive policy optimization
        max_reward = np.max(rewards)
        best_action_index = np.argmax(rewards)
        best_action = action_space[best_action_index]
        return best_action

    def recursive_data_processing(self, new_data):
        self.data.append(new_data)
        refined_data = self.refine_data()
        return refined_data

    def refine_data(self):
        # Recursive refinement of data
        refined_data = np.mean(self.data[-5:], axis=0)
        return refined_data

    def evolve_models(self):
        # Recursive model evolution via genetic algorithms (simplified)
        for i in range(len(self.models)):
            mutated_model = self.mutate_model(self.models[i])
            self.models.append(mutated_model)
        self.select_best_models()

    def mutate_model(self, model):
        # Simplified model mutation
        return model + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, model.shape)

    def select_best_models(self):
        # Placeholder for selecting best models
        self.models = sorted(self.models, key=lambda m: np.random.rand())[:10]

# Usage
ptm_stack = PTMAutonomyStack()
current_state = np.random.rand(10)  # Example state
action_space = [np.random.rand(10) for _ in range(5)]  # Example action space

optimal_action = ptm_stack.recursive_learning(current_state, action_space)
refined_data = ptm_stack.recursive_data_processing(np.random.rand(10))
```

5. **Expandability**:
    - The module is designed to be easily expandible. Additional functions such as more sophisticated learning algorithms, improved recursive strategies, or enhanced model evaluations can be added as standalone components.

6. **Innovation & Recursive Strategy**:
    - This module pioneers recursive self-improvement methods by leveraging a feedback-centric architecture that evaluates and evolves its components.
    - It uses recursion throughout, ensuring that outcomes feed back into the system for continual advancement.

This is a high-level design that serves as a blueprint for building a comprehensive autonomous system module with self-evolving features. Actual implementation would be far more complex and require consideration of the specific PTM empire's operational context and requirements.
