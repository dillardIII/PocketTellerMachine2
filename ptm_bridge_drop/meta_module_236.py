Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a conceptual name or abbreviation relevant to your context) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack involves thinking about several key aspects: adaptability, learning, recursion, and integration with existing systems. Below is a conceptual design outline that you can further develop into a full-fledged module:

### Module Overview: PTM-Autonomy

The PTM-Autonomy module aims to enhance autonomous decision-making and learning capabilities by employing innovative recursive strategies. The module will be structured to allow easy integration, adaptation, and evolution over time.

### Key Features

1. **Recursive Learning**:
   - Implement a recursive neural network (RNN) architecture that allows the system to improve its knowledge and adaptability over time.
   - Use reinforcement learning techniques to help the system refine its decision-making processes based on previous outcomes.

2. **Self-Evolving Models**:
   - Develop a genetic algorithm framework that enables automatic model evolution to suit dynamic operational environments.
   - Allow models to self-assess and trigger retraining or adaptation based on performance metrics.

3. **Hierarchical Task Management**:
   - Introduce a hierarchy-based task scheduling system to prioritize and manage tasks efficiently.
   - Use a task evaluation mechanism that recursively adjusts priorities based on external feedback and internal metrics.

4. **Modular Integration**:
   - Design with modularity to ensure compatibility with existing PTM infrastructure.
   - Encapsulate functionalities in a way that allows for independent updates and replacement of components.

### Core Components

#### 1. Recursive Neural Networks
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class RecursiveRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(RecursiveRNN, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, input, hidden):
        output, hidden = self.rnn(input, hidden)
        output = self.linear(output[:, -1, :])
        return output, hidden

    @staticmethod
    def init_hidden(batch_size, hidden_size):
        return torch.zeros(1, batch_size, hidden_size)
```

#### 2. Genetic Evolution Framework
```python
from deap import base, creator, tools, algorithms

def evaluate(individual):
    # Define an evaluation function for the individuals (models)
    return sum(individual),

def genetic_algorithm():
    creator.create("FitnessMax", base.Fitness, weights=(1.0,))
    creator.create("Individual", list, fitness=creator.FitnessMax)
    
    toolbox = base.Toolbox()
    toolbox.register("attribute", random.random)
    toolbox.register("individual", tools.initRepeat, creator.Individual, toolbox.attribute, n=100)
    toolbox.register("population", tools.initRepeat, list, toolbox.individual)
    
    toolbox.register("evaluate", evaluate)
    toolbox.register("mate", tools.cxTwoPoint)
    toolbox.register("mutate", tools.mutGaussian, mu=0, sigma=1, indpb=0.2)
    toolbox.register("select", tools.selTournament, tournsize=3)

    population = toolbox.population(n=300)
    algorithms.eaSimple(population, toolbox, cxpb=0.5, mutpb=0.2, ngen=40, verbose=True)

    return population
```

#### 3. Hierarchical Task Management
```python
class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.task_queue = []
    
    def add_task(self, task, priority):
        self.task_queue.append((priority, task))
        self.task_queue.sort(reverse=True)  # Higher priority first

    def execute_tasks(self):
        while self.task_queue:
            priority, task = self.task_queue.pop(0)
            print(f"Executing task with priority {priority}: {task}")
            # Task execution logic here
```

### Integration and Execution

- **Integration**: Use APIs or shared data repositories for interaction with existing PTM systems.
- **Execution**: Implement a main control loop (or other orchestration method) that periodically re-evaluates the system’s performance and triggers the learning and task management components accordingly.

```python
def main():
    # Initialize components
    rnn = RecursiveRNN(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, output_size=10)
    task_manager = TaskManager()
    
    # Example use
    task_manager.add_task("Collect data", priority=1)
    task_manager.add_task("Analyze results", priority=2)
    task_manager.execute_tasks()

    population = genetic_algorithm()
    # Further processing or simulation
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Considerations

- **Scalability**: Ensure that the module can scale with increasing data and operational demands.
- **Flexibility**: Allow customization of learning rates, model structures, and task priorities.
- **Maintenance**: Provide logging and monitoring interfaces to facilitate debugging and system health checks.

This design template and pseudocode provide a solid foundation to build on. You can expand and modify each component to suit specific business requirements and operational conditions.
