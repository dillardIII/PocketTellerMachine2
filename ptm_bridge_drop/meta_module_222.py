Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably an empire-focused technology, but for the sake of this example, we'll refer to it as the "Powerful Technology Module") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can learn, adapt, and recursively improve itself over time. Here's an outline and basic structure for such a module:

### Module Name: `self_evolver`

#### Module Overview:

The `self_evolver` module is designed to enhance the autonomy of the PTM systems by integrating self-improvement capabilities using recursive strategies. The key features include:

- **Recursive Learning**: The ability to iteratively improve models based on feedback.
- **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Utilizing AI-driven decision systems to adapt strategies.
- **Dynamic Environment Interaction**: Interacting adaptively with changing environments.
- **Self-Analyzing Diagnostics**: Continuously analyzing system performance and initiating self-improvements.

#### Core Components:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**:
   - Collect data from various sensors and external inputs.
   - Preprocess data for noise reduction and format standardization.

2. **Learning System**:
   - Utilize machine learning models (e.g., neural networks) with capabilities to update recursively.
   - Implement techniques like reinforcement learning for decision-making under uncertainty.

3. **Recursive Strategy Module**:
   - Develop algorithms that continuously refine models using new data.
   - Implement evolutionary algorithms or genetic algorithms to optimize performance.

4. **Environment Interaction Layer**:
   - Interface with external systems and environments.
   - Adapt to changes dynamically through feedback loops.

5. **Diagnostics and Self-Improvement**:
   - Perform regular diagnostics checks.
   - Initiate self-correction and optimization processes.

6. **User Interface**:
   - Provide a dashboard for monitoring system status and performance.
   - Allow manual intervention if necessary.

#### Example Code Structure:

```python
# Filename: self_evolver.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

class SelfEvolver:
    def __init__(self, data_source, model=None):
        self.data_source = data_source
        self.model = model if model else RandomForestClassifier()
        self.performance_history = []

    def acquire_data(self):
        # Simulating data acquisition
        raw_data = self.data_source()
        return self.preprocess_data(raw_data)

    def preprocess_data(self, raw_data):
        # Preprocessing steps (e.g., normalization, filling missing values)
        # For example purposes, assume data comes preprocessed
        return raw_data

    def train_model(self, X, y):
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions = self.model.predict(X_test)
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
        self.performance_history.append(accuracy)
        print(f"Training complete. Current model accuracy: {accuracy}")

    def recursive_learn(self):
        data = self.acquire_data()
        features, labels = data[:, :-1], data[:, -1]
        self.train_model(features, labels)
        self.check_performance_improve()

    def check_performance_improve(self):
        if len(self.performance_history) >= 2:
            improvement = self.performance_history[-1] - self.performance_history[-2]
            if improvement < 0:
                print("Model performance deteriorating. Initiating optimization.")
                self.optimize_model()

    def optimize_model(self):
        # Placeholder for optimization logic (e.g., hyperparameter tuning)
        print("Optimizing model...")

    def interact_with_environment(self):
        # Placeholder for environment interaction logic
        pass

    def diagnostic_check(self):
        # Placeholder for diagnostics logic
        pass

# Example of data source function
def sample_data_source():
    # Returns a numpy array of sample data for testing
    # Sample: 100 samples, 5 features + 1 label
    return np.random.rand(100, 6)

# Example usage
evolver = SelfEvolver(sample_data_source)
evolver.recursive_learn()
```

### Recursive Strategies:

- **Feedback Loops**: Constant feedback helps refine the learning models.
- **Auto-Evolution**: Implement mechanisms where models evolve by natural selection principles, selecting the best performing sub-models for subsequent generations.
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Automatically adjusting performance thresholds based on historical data and current model capabilities.

### Future Enhancements:

- Incorporate deep learning for more complex pattern recognition.
- Extend environmental interaction with IoT integration.
- Add more sophisticated user interfaces for real-time monitoring and control.

This framework serves as a foundation and can be expanded with additional features as the PTM empire's needs grow.
