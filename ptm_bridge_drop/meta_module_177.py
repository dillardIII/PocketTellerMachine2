Creating a Python module for an autonomous system such as the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical autonomous entity or robotic system) empire with self-evolving capabilities involves a blend of machine learning, sensor fusion, decision-making algorithms, and more. I'll outline a conceptual design and suggest implementation strategies, focusing specifically on recursive and self-evolving components.

### Module Design Overview

1. **Module Name**: `ptm_autonomy`

2. **Core Objectives**:
   - Efficiently manage perception using sensor data.
   - Implement recursive learning strategies to improve decision-making.
   - Use a feedback loop for continuous self-evolution.
   - Ensure safe and optimal navigation and task execution.

### Components

#### 1. Perception
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combine data from multiple sensors (e.g., cameras, LIDAR, GPS) for a cohesive understanding of the environment.
  ```python
  def fuse_sensors(data_streams):
      # Combine and preprocess sensor data for analysis
      fused_data = {}
      # Logic to merge sensor information
      return fused_data
  ```

- **Environment Modeling**: Build and update models of the surrounding environment.
  ```python
  def update_environment_model(fused_data):
      # Update the map and models based on new sensor information
      environment_model = {}
      # Logic to create an updated world model
      return environment_model
  ```

#### 2. Decision-Making
- **Path Planning**: Implement algorithms like A* or RRT for navigation.
  ```python
  def plan_path(environment_model, current_position, goal_position):
      # Search for a feasible and optimal path
      path = []
      # Algorithmic path planning logic
      return path
  ```

- **Recursive Strategy**: Use recursive methods for continuous improvement through simulations and real-world feedback.
  ```python
  def recursive_plan_evaluation(current_plan, feedback_loop):
      # Evaluate and recursively improve the plan
      for iteration in range(max_iterations):
          improved_plan = refine_plan(current_plan, feedback_loop)
          if is_converged(improved_plan):
              break
      return improved_plan
  ```

#### 3. Learning
- **Self-Evolutionary Learning**: Implement reinforcement learning or neural evolution strategies to adaptively improve performance over time.
  ```python
  def evolve_strategy(environment_model, feedback):
      strategy_model = initialize_strategy()
      for epoch in range(training_epochs):
          adapt(strategy_model, feedback)
          feedback = evaluate_strategy(environment_model, strategy_model)
      return strategy_model
  ```

#### 4. Feedback Loop
- **Dynamic Feedback Mechanism**: Collect and integrate feedback for continuous improvement and reliability assurance.
  ```python
  def integrate_feedback(sensor_data, outcomes):
      feedback_loop = {}
      # Logic to update the system based on results
      return feedback_loop
  ```

#### 5. Safety & Reliability
- **Error Handling and Recovery**: Strategies for safe operation in uncertain environments.
  ```python
  def error_handling_module(conditions):
      # Analyze conditions and take corrective actions
      safe_state = ensure_safety(conditions)
      return safe_state
  ```

### Implementation Strategy
- **Agility with Modular Design**: Each component of the module should be developed and tested independently, enabling agile adaptability.
- **Recursive Enhancement**: Implement recursive calls in path-planning and learning algorithms to allow continuous improvement.
- **Experimentation with Simulation**: Use simulations extensively to test and refine recursive and learning strategies before deployment.
- **Regular Updates and Testing**: Deploy updates incrementally and in a controlled manner to the live system, consistently testing for regressions or improvements.

### Conclusion

The `ptm_autonomy` module emphasizes recursive strategies, continuous improvement, and adaptation to real-world dynamics. By leveraging modern technologies in machine learning and planning, the module can autonomously evolve and refine its capabilities for enhanced autonomy, robustness, and safety. Deploying this module in the PTM empire would require collaboration with multidisciplinary teams, ongoing experiments, and real-world testing to ensure efficacy and reliability.
