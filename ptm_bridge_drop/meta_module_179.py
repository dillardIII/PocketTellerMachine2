Creating a new Python module for the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies requires careful consideration of autonomous system design, recursive algorithms, and adaptability. Below is a conceptual design and a sample implementation outline.

### Conceptual Design

1. **Modular Architecture**: The module should be modular to allow independent development, testing, and integration into the broader system. Components might include:
   - Data Collection
   - Decision-Making
   - Learning and Adaptation
   - Communication

2. **Recursive Strategies**: Implement recursive algorithms for:
   - Problem-solving (e.g., pathfinding, decision trees)
   - Learning (e.g., recursive neural networks)
   - Adaptation (self-improvement through feedback loops)

3. **Self-evolving Capabilities**:
   - Use genetic algorithms or similar techniques for continuous adaptation.
   - Incorporate reinforcement learning for dynamic decision-making.
   - Develop feedback loops for system evaluation and recalibration.

4. **Interoperability**: Ensure compatibility with existing systems through standardized interfaces (e.g., REST APIs, message queues).

### Sample Implementation Outline

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import random

class SelfEvolvingAutonomy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.environment_state = self.initialize_environment()
        self.policy = self.initialize_policy()

    def initialize_environment(self):
        # Initialize environment parameters
        return {'state': np.zeros((10, 10)), 'goal': (9, 9)}

    def initialize_policy(self):
        # Initialize a policy using a simple neural network or rule-based system
        return np.random.random((10, 10))

    def recursive_decision_making(self, state, depth=0):
        # Implement recursive decision-making with depth control
        if depth > 5:  # Base condition to end recursion
            return self.evaluate_state(state)

        # Evolve the state based on current policy
        new_state = self.transition_function(state)
        return self.recursive_decision_making(new_state, depth + 1)

    def evaluate_state(self, state):
        # Evaluate the current state and return a score
        score = np.sum(state)
        return score

    def transition_function(self, state):
        # Define a transition model (basic example shown)
        return state + np.random.random(state.shape)

    def genetic_algorithm(self):
        # A simple genetic algorithm to evolve policy
        def fitness(policy):
            return np.sum(policy)  # Define a fitness function

        for generation in range(100):
            policies = [self.mutate_policy(self.policy) for _ in range(10)]
            policies.sort(key=fitness, reverse=True)
            self.policy = policies[0]  # Select the best policy

    def mutate_policy(self, policy):
        # Introduce random variations in the policy
        mutation_rate = 0.1
        new_policy = policy + mutation_rate * np.random.randn(*policy.shape)
        return new_policy

    def reinforcement_learning(self):
        # Reinforcement Learning strategy
        learning_rate = 0.1
        discount_factor = 0.9

        state = self.environment_state['state']
        action_reward = self.recursive_decision_making(state)
        self.policy[state] += learning_rate * (action_reward + discount_factor * np.max(self.policy) - self.policy[state])

    def run(self):
        # Main loop to run the self-evolving autonomy
        for episode in range(100):
            print(f"Episode {episode + 1}")
            self.reinforcement_learning()
            self.genetic_algorithm()

# Example usage
autonomy_system = SelfEvolvingAutonomy()
autonomy_system.run()
```

### Key Features

- **Recursive Decision Making**: Uses recursion to evaluate various possible future states.
- **Genetic Algorithm**: A basic genetic algorithm for evolving the policy over generations.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: A simple RL strategy to improve decisions based on rewards.
- **Self-Evolving**: Combines multiple strategies for a system that can adapt and evolve over time.

### Further Development

To expand this module, consider integrating more sophisticated algorithms such as:
- Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) for better decision-making.
- More advanced fitness functions for the genetic algorithm.
- Real-world interfacing through APIs to manipulate real-time data.

This implementation provides a foundational framework that can be enhanced and tailored to specific needs of the PTM empire's autonomy stack while ensuring flexibility and robustness.
