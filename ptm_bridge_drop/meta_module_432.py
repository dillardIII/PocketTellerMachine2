Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably PropTech Management or Personalized Transportation Module? Clarification would be needed in a real-world scenario) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating features that support autonomous decision-making, adaptability, and system growth. Given the execution involves recursive strategies, we'll focus on recursive learning, autonomous system evaluations, and self-optimization.

Below is a conceptual design for such a module:

### Module Name: `autonomy_stack`

```python
# autonomy_stack/__init__.py

class AutonomyEngine:
    def __init__(self, initial_data):
        self.state = initial_data
        self.recursion_depth = 0

    def self_evaluate(self):
        """Evaluate current state of the system and make adjustments."""
        # Implement logic to assess system performance and identify improvement areas
        performance_score = self.state.get_performance_score()
        print(f"Current Performance Score: {performance_score}")
        if performance_score < self.target_performance_score():
            self.self_optimize()

    def self_optimize(self):
        """Adjust internal parameters based on recursive strategies."""
        print("Optimizing System...")
        self.recursion_depth += 1
        # Modify state for optimization
        self.state.adjust_parameters()
        
        # Recursively evaluate the new state
        if self.recursion_depth < self.max_recursion_depth():
            self.self_evaluate()
        else:
            print("Maximum recursion depth reached. Finalizing optimization.")

    def target_performance_score(self):
        """Define the target performance score."""
        # This target can dynamically change, enabling adaptability
        return 90
    
    def max_recursion_depth(self):
        """Define maximum recursion to avoid infinite loops."""
        return 5

    def expand_autonomy(self):
        """Invoke strategies to expand autonomy."""
        # Hypothetical external inputs or environmental interactions
        sensor_data = self.state.get_sensor_data()
        
        # Use recursive learning to enhance decision-making capabilities
        new_strategy_score = self.recursive_learning(sensor_data)
        print(f"New Strategy Score: {new_strategy_score}")
        
        if new_strategy_score > self.state.threshold:
            self.state.update_strategy(new_strategy_score)
            print("Successfully expanded autonomy with new strategy.")

    def recursive_learning(self, data, iteration=0):
        """Recursive learning algorithm to evaluate new data."""
        print(f"Recursive Learning Iteration: {iteration}")
        # Mock learning algorithm that simulates improving over time
        improved_score = self.state.calculate_improved_score(data, iteration)
        
        if iteration < self.max_learning_iterations():
            return self.recursive_learning(data, iteration + 1)
        else:
            return improved_score
        
    def max_learning_iterations(self):
        """Define maximum learning iterations to avoid infinite loops."""
        return 3

class SystemState:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize system properties and state variables
        self.parameters = {"speed": 50, "efficiency": 70}
        self.threshold = 75
    
    def get_performance_score(self):
        """Calculate the current performance score of the system."""
        # Example calculation based on internal parameters
        return (self.parameters['speed'] + self.parameters['efficiency']) / 2

    def adjust_parameters(self):
        """Randomly adjust parameters to improve performance as a demonstration."""
        import random
        self.parameters['speed'] += random.randint(-5, 5)
        self.parameters['efficiency'] += random.randint(-5, 5)

    def get_sensor_data(self):
        """Simulate sensor data acquisition."""
        # Return mock sensor data; in reality, this would interface with hardware
        return {'temperature': 36, 'obstacle_distance': 12}

    def calculate_improved_score(self, data, iteration):
        """Calculate improved score using data and current iteration."""
        # This function is a placeholder for a sophisticated learning algorithm
        return 70 + iteration  # Simulating improvement based on iteration

    def update_strategy(self, new_score):
        """Update strategy based on a new, improved score."""
        self.threshold = new_score

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    initial_state_data = SystemState()
    engine = AutonomyEngine(initial_state_data)
    engine.self_evaluate()
    engine.expand_autonomy()
```

### Key Features of the Module:

1. **Recursive Self-Optimization**: The module uses a recursive approach to fine-tune its operations. This iterative process allows the system to adaptively improve based on a set performance score.

2. **Self-Evaluation**: Continuously assesses the system's performance and calls for optimization when needed, offering a degree of autonomy in decision-making.

3. **Recursive Learning**: A method to improve decision-making capabilities through repeated evaluations, mimicking a learning process.

4. **Environment Simulation Layers**: Simulates inputs from the external environment, such as sensor data, to evaluate strategies for expansion and adaptation.

5. **Dynamic Strategy Adaptation**: Updates and evolves its strategies if better solutions are found during recursive learning.

This module is just a starting point and would require integration with real-world systems and data inputs, plus extensive testing, to create a fully functional autonomy stack for the PTM empire.
