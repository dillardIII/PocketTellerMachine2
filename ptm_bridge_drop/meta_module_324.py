Creating a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably a company or system name) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack can be a complex task, but by focusing on recursive strategies and innovative techniques, we can lay a solid foundation. The module will need to be flexible, adaptive, and capable of learning over time. 

Here's a conceptual design for a module called `evolver.py`:

```python
# evolver.py

import random
import logging

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = self._initial_state()
        self.history = []

    def _initial_state(self):
        # Define initial parameters or states
        return {
            'parameters': {
                'learning_rate': 0.01,
                'exploration_rate': 0.1
            },
            'performance': 0
        }

    def recursive_improvement(self):
        # Recursively evolve and improve system state
        logging.info("Starting recursive improvement...")
        new_state = self._mutate_parameters(self.state)
        new_performance = self._evaluate_performance(new_state)
        
        if new_performance > self.state['performance']:
            logging.info("Improvement found, updating state...")
            self.state = new_state
            self.state['performance'] = new_performance
        
        self.history.append(self.state)

    def _mutate_parameters(self, state):
        # Simulate mutation in parameters for recursive improvements
        mutated_state = state.copy()
        mutated_state['parameters']['learning_rate'] += random.uniform(-0.001, 0.001)
        mutated_state['parameters']['exploration_rate'] += random.uniform(-0.01, 0.01)

        # Ensure parameters are within sensible bounds
        mutated_state['parameters']['learning_rate'] = max(min(mutated_state['parameters']['learning_rate'], 0.1), 0.001)
        mutated_state['parameters']['exploration_rate'] = max(min(mutated_state['parameters']['exploration_rate'], 1.0), 0.01)

        return mutated_state

    def _evaluate_performance(self, state):
        # A mock performance evaluation, simulate by random
        logging.info("Evaluating performance for new state...")
        return random.uniform(0, 100)

    def run_evolution(self, iterations=10):
        for _ in range(iterations):
            self.recursive_improvement()
            logging.info(f"Current state: {self.state}")

    def recover_best_state(self):
        # Find the best historical state
        best_state = max(self.history, key=lambda s: s['performance'])
        logging.info(f"Best state recovered: {best_state}")
        return best_state

if __name__ == "__main__":
    autonomy_stack = AutonomyStack()
    autonomy_stack.run_evolution()
    best_state = autonomy_stack.recover_best_state()
    print("Best autonomous state:", best_state)
```

### Key Concepts:

1. **Recursive Strategies**: The `recursive_improvement` method continuously tries to improve the internal state by tuning certain parameters. This recursive methodology is central to self-evolving systems.

2. **Mutation and Evaluation**: By mutating parameters and evaluating their performance, the module simulates natural selection processes, where only states with improved performance are retained.

3. **History Tracking**: It maintains a history of states, enabling the recovery of the best state based on performance metrics.

4. **Randomness and Constraints**: The module uses randomness to explore the parameter space and enforces constraints to keep mutations within practical ranges.

5. **Modular and Extensible**: The designed module is simple yet modular, allowing for further expansion and nuances in evaluation and mutation strategies.

Future improvements could include:
- Integrating real performance metrics relevant to the PTM empire's goals.
- Adding machine learning models for better performance evaluation.
- Incorporating more complex mutation operations that resemble crossover in genetic algorithms.

This is a foundational code that you can expand upon based on specific requirements of the PTM autonomy stack.
