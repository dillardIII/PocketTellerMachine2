Designing a Python module for the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves focusing on advanced concepts like machine learning, recursive algorithms, and self-improvement features. Below is an overview of a potential design with key components and a sample implementation to illustrate these ideas.

### Module Design

#### 1. **Adaptive Learning Framework**
   - **Core Functionality:** Implement machine learning models that can adapt over time using new data without complete retraining.
   - **Components:**
     - Online learning algorithms
     - Transfer learning capabilities
     - Continuous evaluation and feedback

#### 2. **Recursive Strategy Engine**
   - **Core Functionality:** Utilize recursive algorithms for decision-making processes, allowing the stack to explore options efficiently and optimize autonomously.
   - **Components:**
     - Recursive decision trees
     - Dynamic programming approaches
     - Self-optimization routines

#### 3. **Self-Evolution Mechanism**
   - **Core Functionality:** Enable the system to improve its own algorithms and performance metrics.
   - **Components:**
     - Genetic algorithms for optimization
     - Reinforcement learning for policy improvements
     - Automated feature engineering

#### 4. **Integration & Interface Layer**
   - **Core Functionality:** Provide interfaces for seamless integration with other services and systems.
   - **Components:**
     - RESTful API endpoints
     - Microservices for modularity
     - Event-driven architecture

### Sample Implementation

Below is a simplified code snippet demonstrating recursive strategy and adaptive learning:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin

class RecursiveDecisionEngine:
    def __init__(self, threshold=0.5):
        self.threshold = threshold
    
    def recursive_search(self, data, depth=0):
        if depth > len(data):
            return None
        current_val = data[depth]
        print(f"Current depth {depth}: evaluating {current_val}")
        if current_val > self.threshold:
            print(f"Successful decision at depth {depth}")
            return current_val
        return self.recursive_search(data, depth + 1)


class EvolvingModel(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
    def __init__(self, base_model):
        self.base_model = base_model

    def fit(self, X, y):
        self.base_model.fit(X, y)

    def predict(self, X):
        return self.base_model.predict(X)

    def partial_fit(self, X, y, classes=None):
        """ Online learning: Updates model with incoming data """
        if hasattr(self.base_model, "partial_fit"):
            self.base_model.partial_fit(X, y, classes)
        else:
            print("Base model does not support online learning.")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier

    # Recursive Strategy Engine Example
    data_sequence = np.random.rand(10)
    rde = RecursiveDecisionEngine(threshold=0.7)
    rde.recursive_search(data_sequence)

    # Adaptive Learning Model Example
    base_model = SGDClassifier(max_iter=1000, tol=1e-3)
    model = EvolvingModel(base_model=base_model)

    X_train, y_train = np.random.rand(100, 5), np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    X_new, y_new = np.random.rand(10, 5), np.random.randint(0, 2, 10)
    model.partial_fit(X_new, y_new, classes=[0, 1])
```

### Key Considerations
1. **Scalability:** Ensure the system can handle growing data sets and complexity.
2. **Security:** Implement security protocols to protect data and processes.
3. **Interoperability:** Design the module to work well with different platforms and technologies.

The proposed design and implementation represent a starting point for building a sophisticated and self-evolving autonomy stack tailored to the PTM empire's needs, focusing on adaptability, optimization, and seamless integration.
