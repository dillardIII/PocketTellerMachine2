Creating a new Python module that focuses on enhancing the self-evolving capabilities of PTM (Presumably a hypothetical autonomous system) involves designing a system that can learn, adapt, and optimize its behavior over time. The module will leverage recursive strategies, enabling adaptive learning and decision-making processes. Below is a conceptual design of such a module.

### Module: `auto_evolve`

#### Key Features:
1. **Self-Evolving Architecture**: Utilize recursive functions that enable the system's components to adapt based on experience.
2. **Adaptive Learning**: Implement machine learning models that can learn from past decisions and environmental changes.
3. **Decision Optimization**: Algorithms to optimize decision-making processes recursively.
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Capabilities to detect deviations and trigger self-correction mechanisms.

#### Components:

1. **Recursive Strategy Engine**:
    - **Purpose**: To implement recursive algorithms that enable self-improvement.
    - **Key Methods**:
        - `recursive_evaluate()`: Continuously evaluate performance to guide recursive adjustments.
        - `adaptive_decay()`: Adjust learning rates and objectives based on recursive evaluation.
        - `recursive_optimization()`: Optimize decision-making processes using recursive feedback.

2. **Machine Learning Toolkit**:
    - **Purpose**: Leverage machine learning models to improve decision-making.
    - **Key Methods**:
        - `train()`: Train models using historical and real-time data.
        - `predict()`: Make predictions to support decision-making.
        - `update_model()`: Allow models to evolve with new data via recursive inputs.

3. **Anomaly Detection Unit**:
    - **Purpose**: Detect anomalies or unexpected behaviors in the system and trigger corrective actions.
    - **Key Methods**:
        - `detect_anomaly()`: Identify when the system deviates from expected behavior.
        - `trigger_response()`: Initiate corrective measures.
        - `feedback_loop()`: Use detected anomalies to educate the adaptive models.

4. **Decision Support System**:
    - **Purpose**: Make optimal decisions in complex, dynamic environments.
    - **Key Methods**:
        - `make_decision()`: Use a combination of heuristic, rule-based, and machine learning strategies.
        - `evaluate_decision()`: Assess the outcome of decisions recursively.
        - `improve_strategy()`: Continuously improve decision strategies based on recursive evaluations.

#### Sample Code

```python
class AutoEvolve:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = None  # Placeholder for the machine learning model
        self.decision_history = []

    def recursive_evaluate(self, data):
        """Evaluate system performance and guide recursive adjustments."""
        # Placeholder: Your logic here
        performance = self.analyze_performance(data)
        self.adaptive_decay(performance)
        return performance

    def adaptive_decay(self, performance):
        """Adjust learning rates and objectives based on recursive evaluation."""
        # Placeholder: Your logic here
        pass

    def train(self, data):
        """Train models using historical and real-time data."""
        # Placeholder: Integrate your ML model training here
        pass

    def predict(self, input_data):
        """Make predictions to support decision-making."""
        # Placeholder: Integrate your ML prediction logic here
        pass

    def detect_anomaly(self, data):
        """Identify system anomalies."""
        # Placeholder: Your anomaly detection logic here
        anomalies = []
        return anomalies

    def make_decision(self, input_data):
        """Make decisions using heuristic, rule-based, and ML strategies."""
        prediction = self.predict(input_data)
        decision = self.decide(prediction)
        self.decision_history.append(decision)
        return decision

    def decide(self, prediction):
        """Decide based on prediction."""
        # Placeholder: Decision logic
        return prediction

    def improve_strategy(self):
        """Continuously improve decision strategies."""
        # Use recursive evaluations to adjust strategies
        for decision in self.decision_history:
            self.recursive_optimization()

    def recursive_optimization(self):
        """Optimize decisions using recursive feedback."""
        # Placeholder: Optimization logic
        pass


# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    auto_evolver = AutoEvolve()
    input_data = {}  # Placeholder for actual input data
    auto_evolver.train(input_data)
    decision = auto_evolver.make_decision(input_data)
    print(f"Made decision: {decision}")
    auto_evolver.improve_strategy()
```

### Conclusion
This conceptual Python module (`auto_evolve`) for the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack introduces recursive strategies alongside adaptive learning and decision optimization functionalities. Such a dynamic and evolving system can be a powerful tool in the development of advanced autonomous technologies. Note that the placeholders should be replaced with real implementations tailored to PTM's specific needs and context.
