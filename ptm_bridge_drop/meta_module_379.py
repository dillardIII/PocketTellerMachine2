Creating a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably refers to a conceptual organization) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack could involve several components, relying on advanced machine learning, artificial intelligence, and recursive improvement strategies. Below is a high-level design concept for such a module:

### Module: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Overview

The `ptm_autonomy` module aims to enhance the PTM empire's operational capabilities through self-evolving, autonomous systems. It uses recursive strategies to iteratively improve decision-making and efficiency across a range of applications.

#### Key Components

1. **Recursive Learning Engine**
   - **Purpose:** Utilize recursive algorithms to iteratively improve model performance and optimize system operations.
   - **Functionality:**
     - Implement meta-learning techniques to facilitate the learning of learning algorithms.
     - Use reinforcement learning (RL) to enable systems to learn from feedback loops.
     - Incorporate genetic algorithms for evolving solutions over generations.

2. **Adaptive Optimization Layer**
   - **Purpose:** Optimize resource allocation dynamically across various PTM operations.
   - **Functionality:**
     - Use multi-objective optimization to balance competing priorities.
     - Implement simulated annealing and other heuristic approaches to find near-optimal solutions.
     - Integrate swarm intelligence principles for decentralized decision-making.

3. **Self-diagnosis and Healing Subsystem**
   - **Purpose:** Autonomously identify and correct anomalies or inefficiencies.
   - **Functionality:**
     - Deploy anomaly detection models to monitor system performance.
     - Implement automated rollback or patching mechanisms in response to identified issues.
     - Develop predictive maintenance models to preemptively address potential failures.

4. **Knowledge Graph Framework**
   - **Purpose:** Organize and utilize data efficiently for strategic decision-making.
   - **Functionality:**
     - Use graph databases to store and manage complex interrelations between entities.
     - Implement semantic reasoning for improved data interpretation.
     - Facilitate collaborative filtering and recommendation systems to enhance user interactions.

5. **Human-AI Collaboration Tools**
   - **Purpose:** Foster seamless integration between human operators and AI systems.
   - **Functionality:**
     - Develop intuitive interfaces for human oversight and input.
     - Implement explainable AI techniques to improve transparency and trust.
     - Use sentiment analysis to gauge and respond to human operator feedback.

#### Example Implementation

Below is a simplistic illustrative setup of a recursive learning engine component in Python:

```python
# File: ptm_autonomy/recursive_learning.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

class RecursiveLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self, models=None):
        self.models = models or []
    
    def add_model(self, model):
        self.models.append(model)

    def train(self, X, y):
        for model in self.models:
            model.fit(X, y)
            predictions = model.predict(X)
            residuals = y - predictions
            X = np.column_stack((X, predictions))  # Recursive feature addition

    def predict(self, X):
        for model in self.models:
            predictions = model.predict(X)
            X = np.column_stack((X, predictions))
        return predictions

# Usage
tree1 = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3)
tree2 = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=5)
rl_engine = RecursiveLearningEngine(models=[tree1, tree2])
```

#### Next Steps

1. **Testing and Validation:** Rigorously test the module in simulated environments.
2. **Integration:** Ensure seamless integration with existing PTM infrastructure.
3. **Iteration:** Continuously iterate and enhance the module using real-world feedback.

This conceptual module is designed to be adaptive, self-improving, and capable of operating with a high degree of autonomy, thus underpinning the continual evolution and expansion of the PTM empire's capabilities.
