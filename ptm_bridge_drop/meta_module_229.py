Creating a Python module to expand the self-evolving autonomy stack for the PTM (presumably an abbreviation referring to a specific technological entity or a fictional empire) is a complex task, especially if it requires implementing innovative recursive strategies. Here's a high-level design of such a module that focuses on modularity, self-improvement, and autonomous decision-making.

### Module Overview
The module will have the following key components:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: To continuously feed the system with data, enabling it to learn and adapt.

2. **Recursive Learning Algorithm**: An innovative learning strategy that leverages recursion to improve model accuracy and decision-making capabilities over time.

3. **Adaptive Feedback System**: A mechanism to evaluate outcomes and refine the learning algorithms continually.

4. **Dynamic Model Optimization**: Self-tuning and optimizing the existing models to improve efficiency and effectiveness autonomously.

5. **Simulation and Testing Environment**: A sandbox environment to test changes before deploying them into the live system to ensure stability and reliability.

Here's how you might structure this in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from collections import deque
import random

class SelfEvolvingModule:
    def __init__(self, model, data, target):
        self.model = model
        self.data = data
        self.target = target
        self.history = deque(maxlen=10)  # Keep recent 10 model performances
        self.threshold = 0.01  # Performance improvement threshold
    
    def collect_data(self):
        # Placeholder for data collection from sensors or external APIs
        pass
    
    def preprocess_data(self):
        # Implement your preprocessing logic here
        X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(self.data, self.target, test_size=0.2)
        return X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid
    
    def recursive_learning(self, x_train, y_train, max_depth=5, current_depth=0):
        if current_depth >= max_depth:
            return self.model.fit(x_train, y_train)
        
        # Recursive logic to self-improve
        self.model.fit(x_train, y_train)
        improved_model = self.optimize(x_train, y_train)
        self.history.append(improved_model)
        
        if self.is_improvement_significant():
            self.recursive_learning(x_train, y_train, max_depth, current_depth + 1)
        
    def optimize(self, x, y):
        # Implement dynamic model optimization, e.g., hyperparameter tuning
        # This is a placeholder for advanced optimization techniques
        self.model.fit(x, y)
        return self.model
    
    def is_improvement_significant(self):
        # Check model performance improvement
        if len(self.history) < 2:
            return False
        recent, previous = self.history[-1], self.history[-2]
        improvement = accuracy_score(recent.predict(self.data), self.target) - accuracy_score(previous.predict(self.data), self.target)
        return improvement > self.threshold
    
    def feedback_loop(self):
        x_train, x_valid, y_train, y_valid = self.preprocess_data()
        self.recursive_learning(x_train, y_train)
        performance = accuracy_score(self.model.predict(x_valid), y_valid)
        print(f"Validation Accuracy: {performance}")

    def simulate(self):
        # A sandbox for testing changes
        test_data, test_target = self.create_test_environment()
        prediction = self.model.predict(test_data)
        print(f"Simulation result: {accuracy_score(prediction, test_target)}")
    
    def create_test_environment(self):
        # Create a synthetic test environment for simulation
        return train_test_split(self.data, self.target, test_size=0.1)

# Usage Example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Assume `CustomModel` is a placeholder for a pre-defined ML model
    # and `data`, `target` are your dataset and labels
    data = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
    target = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    model = LogisticRegression()

    sem = SelfEvolvingModule(model, data, target)
    sem.collect_data()
    sem.feedback_loop()
    sem.simulate()
```

### Highlights

1. **Modular Design**: Each component (data collection, preprocessing, training, etc.) is modular, allowing easy extension or modification.

2. **Recursive Learning Strategy**: By reapplying the learning algorithm with a depth limit, this module aims to refine its strategies and improve performance iteratively.

3. **Autonomous Optimization**: The system continuously evaluates its performance and adjusts parameters, using methods that can include grid search, genetic algorithms, or other hyperparameter optimization techniques for better results.

4. **Simulation Environment**: The sandbox environment allows for rigorous testing of new strategies without affecting the live system.

5. **Feedback and Continuous Learning**: The feedback loop ensures the module stays relevant and continuously improves its decision-making capabilities.

To apply this module effectively, you would need to tailor it to the specific needs and constraints of the PTM empire's technologies and use real-world data and models.
