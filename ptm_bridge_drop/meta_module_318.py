Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presume it stands for Potential Task Management or something relevant) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves a combination of advanced algorithms for decision-making, learning, and process optimization. Below is an outline and sample code that includes innovative recursive strategies and self-adapting features.

### Module Overview: PyPTM

**Module Name:** PyPTM

**Purpose:** To enhance self-evolving capabilities of autonomous systems within the PTM empire by using recursive strategies and machine learning techniques.

**Key Features:**
1. **Recursive Decision Trees:** Adapt and evolve decisions based on historical data and outcomes.
2. **Self-Optimization Loop:** Continuously improve system performance using feedback loops and recursive algorithms.
3. **Dynamic Task Allocation:** Use recursive strategies to allocate and prioritize tasks dynamically.
4. **Predictive Modelling:** Employ machine learning to predict outcomes and optimize strategies.

### PyPTM Module Structure

```python
# pyptm.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)


class SelfEvolvingAutonomy:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.model = None

    def recursive_decision_tree(self, max_depth=None):
        """
        Create a recursive decision tree that evolves with new data.
        """
        X, y = self.data[:, :-1], self.data[:, -1]
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
        
        if not self.model:
            self.model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=max_depth)
            self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
            logging.info(f"Initial Model Training Complete.")
        else:
            # Retrain the model with the recursive strategy
            self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
            logging.info(f"Model Retrained.")

        predictions = self.model.predict(X_test)
        logging.info(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, predictions):.2f}")

    def self_optimizing_loop(self):
        """
        Recursive strategy to continuously improve system performance.
        """
        iteration = 0
        while True:
            logging.info(f"Optimization Loop Iteration: {iteration}")
            self.recursive_decision_tree(max_depth=5 + iteration % 5)
            iteration += 1

            if iteration > 10:  # example condition to break loop
                logging.info("Optimization Loop Complete.")
                break

    def dynamic_task_allocation(self, tasks, resources):
        """
        Recursively allocate tasks based on priority and resource availability.
        """
        if not tasks:
            return

        task = tasks.pop(0)
        allocated_resource = resources.pop(0) if resources else None

        logging.info(f"Allocating Task: {task} to Resource: {allocated_resource}")

        # Recursively allocate remaining tasks
        self.dynamic_task_allocation(tasks, resources)


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Simulated data
    np.random.seed(42)
    data = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # 100 samples, 4 features + target

    # Initialize the system
    autonomy_system = SelfEvolvingAutonomy(data=data)
    
    # Run self-optimizing loop
    autonomy_system.self_optimizing_loop()
    
    # Task and resource example
    tasks = ["Task1", "Task2", "Task3"]
    resources = ["Resource1", "Resource2"]
    
    # Perform dynamic task allocation
    autonomy_system.dynamic_task_allocation(tasks, resources)
```

### Key Points:

1. **Recursive Decision Trees:** By continuously retraining decision trees, the module adapts to new data and evolving circumstances.
   
2. **Self-Optimizing Loop:** A while loop perpetually optimizes the model, invoking the recursive decision tree method, thus making the system adaptive.

3. **Dynamic Task Allocation:** This function uses a recursive approach to allocate tasks based on priority and available resources, showcasing flexibility and adaptability.

4. **Log Management:** Logging is integrated to track the progress and changes within the system, which is crucial for debugging and analyzing system evolution. 

By implementing this module, the PTM empire can leverage advanced recursive and self-evolving strategies to improve autonomy in task management and decision-making.
