Designing a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably a Placeholder Name: "PTM" might stand for something specific in your context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves a combination of several advanced computing concepts. The module could focus on self-optimization, decision-making, and recursive learning strategies. Hereâ€™s a conceptual design with some code snippets to illustrate these ideas:

### Module Design

#### Overview
The module will focus on:
- **Self-Optimization**: Uses machine learning algorithms to optimize itself over time.
- **Decision-Making**: Implement intelligent decision algorithms that improve with recursive strategy checks.
- **Recursive Learning**: Allow recursive strategies where the system continuously evaluates and refines its approaches.

#### Key Components
1. **Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs)**: For learning patterns and improving predictions over time.
2. **Genetic Algorithms (GAs)**: For evolving strategies based on performance metrics.
3. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: To enable the system to make decisions based on past actions and rewards.

### Python Module: `ptm_autonomy`

```python
import numpy as np
import random
from collections import deque
from typing import Any, Callable, List

class RecursiveNeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self, input_size: int, hidden_size: int):
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.weights_input_hidden = np.random.randn(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.weights_hidden_output = np.random.randn(hidden_size, 1)

    def forward(self, inputs: np.ndarray):
        hidden_layer = np.dot(inputs, self.weights_input_hidden)
        hidden_layer = np.tanh(hidden_layer)
        output_layer = np.dot(hidden_layer, self.weights_hidden_output)
        return output_layer

    def train(self, data, epochs):
        """A simple training loop using backpropagation (dummy implementation)."""
        # A placeholder for recursive improvement logic
        for epoch in range(epochs):
            for inputs, target in data:
                output = self.forward(inputs)
                error = target - output
                self.recursive_backpropagate(error, inputs)

    def recursive_backpropagate(self, error: np.ndarray, inputs: np.ndarray):
        """Placeholder to demonstrate recursive training logic."""
        # Recursive logic to adjust weights
        pass

class GeneticAlgorithm:
    def __init__(self, strategy_func: Callable, population_size: int = 50, mutation_rate: float = 0.01):
        self.strategy_func = strategy_func
        self.population = [self.strategy_func() for _ in range(population_size)]
        self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate

    def evolve(self):
        sorted_population = sorted(self.population, key=lambda indiv: indiv.fitness(), reverse=True)
        top_performers = sorted_population[:len(sorted_population)//2]
        
        # Offspring generation with mutation
        new_population = top_performers.copy()
        while len(new_population) < len(self.population):
            parent1, parent2 = random.sample(top_performers, 2)
            child = self.mutate(self.crossover(parent1, parent2))
            new_population.append(child)

        self.population = new_population

    def crossover(self, parent1: Any, parent2: Any) -> Any:
        # Implement crossover logic here
        pass

    def mutate(self, individual: Any) -> Any:
        # Implement mutation logic here
        pass

class ReinforcementLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate: float, discount_factor: float, exploration_rate: float):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.discount_factor = discount_factor
        self.exploration_rate = exploration_rate
        self.q_table = {}

    def choose_action(self, state: str):
        if random.uniform(0, 1) < self.exploration_rate:
            return self.random_action()
        else:
            return self.best_action(state)

    def best_action(self, state: str):
        if state not in self.q_table:
            return self.random_action()

        return max(self.q_table[state], key=self.q_table[state].get)

    def update_q_table(self, state: str, action: str, reward: float, next_state: str):
        if state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[state] = {}
        
        if action not in self.q_table[state]:
            self.q_table[state][action] = 0

        best_next_action = self.best_action(next_state)
        td_target = reward + self.discount_factor * self.q_table.get(next_state, {}).get(best_next_action, 0)
        td_error = td_target - self.q_table[state][action]
        
        self.q_table[state][action] += self.learning_rate * td_error

    def random_action(self):
        # Define action space
        pass

# Main recursive strategy logic
def recursive_strategy_evaluation(module_classes: List[Any], iterations: int = 10):
    for iteration in range(iterations):
        for module_class in module_classes:
            # Execute and evaluate
            module_instance = module_class()
            # Evaluate performance or fitness
            pass

### Key Concepts

- **Recursive Neural Networks**: Train using recursive backpropagation to iteratively improve predictions. This also serves as a base for continuous improvement.
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Implement to evolve strategies whereby the "fittest" solutions become candidates for genetic operations like crossover and mutation.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Agent-based learning system that improves its decision-making policy from experience (trial and error) and rewards.

This setup suggests a framework where the system is inherently self-improving and continuously explores better strategies autonomously.

### Future Improvements

While the above module is quite basic, further enhancements could include:

- **Parameter Optimization**: Use Bayesian optimization for hyperparameters.
- **Advanced Neural Architectures**: Implement advanced architectures like LSTMs for better sequence prediction.
- **Parallel Processing**: Employ distributed computing to speed up recursive evaluations.
- **Enterprise Integration**: Create APIs for integration with other PTM systems and data sources.

This modular and flexible design allows for significant customization and expansion as the PTM empire evolves its autonomy stack.
