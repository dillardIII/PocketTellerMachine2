Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "Post-Transformer Model") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies is a complex task. This module needs to incorporate modern concepts from artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, recursion, and perhaps self-improving algorithms. Here’s a structured approach to designing such a module, considering Python's capabilities and trends in AI:

### Module Overview

**Module Name:** `ptm_autonomy_stack`

**Core Objectives:**
1. **Self-Evolution:** Implement strategies that allow models to adapt and improve autonomously.
2. **Recursive Learning:** Utilize recursive techniques to refine predictions and decisions.
3. **Scalability:** Ensure the system can handle increasing data loads and complexity.

### Module Components

1. **Data Preprocessor (`data_preprocessor.py`):**
   - **Purpose:** Clean, transform and prepare data in a recursive manner.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Recursive feature engineering.
     - Anomaly detection and correction.
   - **Sample Function:**
     ```python
     def recursive_clean(data, depth=0):
         # Implement a recursive method to clean the data
         # based on some condition
         if depth > MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH or data.is_clean():
             return data
         cleaned_data = clean_data_step(data)
         return recursive_clean(cleaned_data, depth + 1)
     ```
   
2. **Model Enhancer (`model_enhancer.py`):**
   - **Purpose:** Use recursive methods to enhance the model’s performance.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Model selection and validation leveraging recursive cross-validation.
     - Self-improving algorithms through meta-learning.
   - **Sample Function:**
     ```python
     def recursive_cv(model, data, labels, depth=0):
         # Recursive cross-validation
         if depth > MAX_CV_DEPTH:
             return evaluate_model(model, data, labels)
         score = cross_validate_step(model, data, labels)
         return recursive_cv(model, data, labels, depth + 1)
     ```

3. **Self-Evolving Algorithms (`self_evolution.py`):**
   - **Purpose:** Implement self-evolving logic for continual model improvement.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Genetic algorithms for parameter tuning.
     - Reinforcement learning based strategic planning.
   - **Sample Pseudocode:**
     ```python
     class EvolvingAgent:
         def __init__(self, model):
             self.model = model
             
         def evolve(self, data):
             # Implement genetic algorithm
             best_config = genetic_search(data, self.model)
             self.model.set_config(best_config)
     
         def reinforce(self, env):
             # Implement reinforcement learning to improve strategies
             strategy = self.strategy_learning(env)
             return strategy
     ```

4. **Feedback Loop (`feedback.py`):**
   - **Purpose:** Integrate feedback loops for real-time improvements.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Real-time data ingestion.
     - Recursive feedback evaluation.
   - **Sample Function:**
     ```python
     def feedback_loop(model, live_data):
         # Recursive feedback mechanism
         feedback = gather_feedback(live_data)
         if feedback.is_stable():
             return "Stable"
         model.adjust(feedback)
         return feedback_loop(model, live_data)
     ```

### Integration Strategy

- **Recursive Strategies:** Each component recursively calls its primary function to ensure multiple layers of improvement and learning.
- **Component Interaction:** Each component interacts to form a cohesive self-evolving ecosystem.
- **Scalability:** Use asynchronous processing for handling large data sets and high frequency updates.

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Utilize Python Libraries:** Use existing libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn for machine learning processes.
2. **Concurrency:** Leverage Python's `asyncio` or multi-threading for handling recursive tasks efficiently.
3. **Testing:** Create a comprehensive suite of unit tests to test recursive logic and autonomy strategies.

This structure provides a foundation for developing an advanced autonomy stack for the PTM empire, incorporating modern AI principles with recursive and self-evolving strategies. Adapt as required for specific domain or industry applications.
