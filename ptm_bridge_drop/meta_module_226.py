Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical entity's name) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves several key components. This module would likely incorporate state-of-the-art techniques in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and recursive algorithms to enhance the adaptability and scalability of autonomous systems. Here's a conceptual outline for such a module:

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy_evolution`

#### Key Features:

1. **Recursive Neural Networks (RvNNs)**:
   - Utilize Recursive Neural Networks to enable hierarchical processing of data and decisions.
   - Implement specialized layers to handle both structured and unstructured data inputs.

2. **Self-improving Algorithms**:
   - Develop algorithms that continuously learn and improve based on feedback loops.
   - Incorporate reinforcement learning techniques like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to refine decision-making over time.

3. **Automated Feature Engineering**:
   - Use recursive feature elimination and generation techniques to iteratively optimize feature sets for various models.

4. **Adaptable Model Architectures**:
   - Implement solutions that allow models to dynamically adjust their architectures based on task requirements, similar to neural architecture search.

5. **Hierarchical Decision Making**:
   - Create systems that break down decisions into sub-decisions, with feedback mechanisms to improve each level recursively.

6. **Scalable Simulation Environments**:
   - Develop virtual environments for testing and training autonomous systems in a recursively scalable manner.

7. **Cross-Domain Learning**:
   - Share insights and features across different domains to leverage diverse data sources and improve learning efficiency.

8. **Explainability and Visualization**:
   - Incorporate tools for visualizing decision paths and model behaviors, with a focus on making recursive processes transparent.

#### Sample Code Structure:

```python
# ptm_autonomy_evolution/__init__.py

# Import essential components 
from .rec_nn import RecursiveNeuralNetwork
from .self_improving_algorithms import SelfImprovingModel
from .feature_engineer import AutomatedFeatureEngineer
from .decision_maker import HierarchicalDecisionMaker
from .simulation import ScalableSimulation
from .cross_domain_learner import CrossDomainLearner
from .explainability import ModelExplainability

__all__ = [
    'RecursiveNeuralNetwork',
    'SelfImprovingModel',
    'AutomatedFeatureEngineer',
    'HierarchicalDecisionMaker',
    'ScalableSimulation',
    'CrossDomainLearner',
    'ModelExplainability'
]

# Each component would have more detailed implementation.
```

### Sample Component: Recursive Neural Networks

```python
# ptm_autonomy_evolution/rec_nn.py

import torch.nn as nn
import torch

class RecursiveNeuralNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(RecursiveNeuralNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.rnn_cell = nn.RNNCell(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.out_layer = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, input, hidden):
        for i in range(len(input)):
            hidden = self.rnn_cell(input[i], hidden)
        output = self.out_layer(hidden)
        return output

    def init_hidden(self):
        return torch.zeros(1, self.hidden_size)

# This is a simplified representation. Full implementation may involve extensions such as tree-structured RNNs for processing hierarchical data.

```

### Comprehensive Testing and Validation:
- Use advanced testing frameworks to validate each component.
- Build a suite of test cases that can explore edge cases and common use scenarios.
- Continuous integration to ensure module updates do not break existing functionality.

### Documentation and Tutorials:
- Provide detailed documentation with guidelines on how to integrate and extend each component.
- Include tutorials and example use cases to demonstrate practical applications of the module.

### Conclusion
The `ptm_autonomy_evolution` module is designed to be a robust framework for enhancing the autonomy stack of the PTM empire. By leveraging advanced recursive strategies, this module aims to push the boundaries of what autonomous systems can achieve, with a focus on continuous improvement, adaptability, and transparency.
