Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical empire) self-evolving autonomy stack is an interesting task. To craft an innovative module with recursive strategies, let's outline a system that incorporates elements of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and recursive algorithms to enhance autonomy. We will call this module `AutoExpand`.

### Overview

`AutoExpand` is designed to enable self-evolving capabilities through a series of interconnected components. The core functionalities focus on decision-making, learning adaptation, and recursive enhancement.

### Module Components

1. **Recursive Learning Engine**:
    - Implements machine learning algorithms that can adapt over time.
    - Utilizes neural networks, decision trees, or reinforcement learning tailored for recurring patterns in decision-making data.
    
2. **Decision Forest**:
    - A variation of random forests where decision trees evolve recursively based on feedback loops, continuously pruning and growing branches dependent on the accuracy of predictions.
    
3. **Self-Optimizing Agents**:
    - Autonomous agents that use genetic algorithms to evolve their strategies and improve efficiency through simulation environments.
    
4. **Feedback Loops & Adaptation**:
    - An interpretation engine that processes environment feedback recursively and refines strategies based on success and failure rates.

5. **Recursive Task Scheduler**:
    - Manages and delegates tasks across the system with recursive prioritization to dynamically rank and address tasks with evolving urgency and importance.

### Sample Implementation

```python
import random
from collections import deque
from typing import Any, List

class RecursiveLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = deque()  # Stores the learning models

    def adapt(self, data: List[Any]):
        # Method to learn and adapt models
        new_model = self.train_new_model(data)
        if len(self.models) >= 5:  # Keep the queue at a manageable size
            self.models.popleft()
        self.models.append(new_model)

    def train_new_model(self, data: List[Any]):
        # Placeholder for model training logic
        # Implement specific ML algorithms here
        model = {"data_size": len(data)}
        print(f"Trained a new model with {len(data)} data points.")
        return model

class DecisionForest:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trees = []

    def evolve_trees(self, feedback_scores: List[float]):
        # A recursive function to refine trees
        for i, tree in enumerate(self.trees):
            if feedback_scores[i] < 0.75:  # Example threshold
                self.prune_tree(i)
                print(f"Pruned tree number {i}.")
            else:
                self.grow_tree(i)
                print(f"Grew tree number {i}.")

    def prune_tree(self, index: int):
        # Pruning logic
        pass

    def grow_tree(self, index: int):
        # Growing logic
        pass

    def add_tree(self, tree: Any):
        self.trees.append(tree)

class SelfOptimizingAgent:
    def __init__(self, strategy: List[Any]):
        self.strategy = strategy

    def evolve_strategy(self):
        # Implementing genetic evolution steps
        self.strategy = self.mutate(self.strategy)

    def mutate(self, strategy: List[Any]):
        return [random.choice([s, random.choice(self.strategy)]) for s in strategy]

class RecursiveTaskScheduler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []

    def add_task(self, task: Any, priority: int):
        self.tasks.append((priority, task))
        self.tasks.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])

    def execute_tasks(self):
        for priority, task in self.tasks:
            self.execute_task(task)

    def execute_task(self, task: Any):
        # Implement task execution logic
        print(f"Executing task with priority: {task}")

# Example of using the module:
engine = RecursiveLearningEngine()
engine.adapt(["Sample data point 1", "Sample data point 2"])

forest = DecisionForest()
forest.add_tree("Tree1")
forest.evolve_trees([0.8, 0.6])

agent = SelfOptimizingAgent(["Strategy1", "Strategy2"])
agent.evolve_strategy()

scheduler = RecursiveTaskScheduler()
scheduler.add_task("Task1", 5)
scheduler.add_task("Task2", 10)
scheduler.execute_tasks()
```

### Key Innovative Aspects

1. **Recursive Feedback**: Enhancements using feedback to evolve each component.
2. **Dynamic Learning**: A focus on models evolving with every data cycle.
3. **Hierarchical Structure**: Prioritization and recursive task execution contributing to efficient resource management.

This module presents a framework that can be incrementally extended to address the needs of the PTM empire's autonomy stack, making it scalable for future innovations.
