Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Potentially Transformative Model) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves various innovative recursive strategies to facilitate adaptability, learning, and optimization. Below is a conceptual outline and basic implementation to demonstrate how such a module could be designed. The focus here is on recursive learning and decision-making processes.

### Conceptual Design

1. **Recursive Learning**: Implement recursive neural networks or transformers to improve the model's ability to handle sequential data and make decisions based on historical context.
2. **Self-Evolving Mechanism**: Create a feedback loop where the model can evaluate its performance and adjust its parameters automatically.
3. **Modular Architecture**: Build a plug-and-play architecture to easily integrate new algorithms and technologies.
4. **Adaptive Decision Making**: Equip the system with decision-making capabilities that evolve based on environmental changes.
5. **Monitoring and Adaptation**: Use monitors for tracking the model's performance and adapt its strategies in real-time.

### Python Module Implementation

```python
import numpy as np
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SelfEvolvingModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, num_layers=1):
        super(SelfEvolvingModel, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.num_layers = num_layers
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.adaptation_rate = 0.1

    def forward(self, x):
        h0 = torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size)
        out, _ = self.rnn(x, h0)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])  # Consider the last time step
        return out

    def recursive_train(self, data_loader, num_epochs=10, learning_rate=0.01):
        criterion = nn.MSELoss()
        optimizer = optim.Adam(self.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
        
        for epoch in range(num_epochs):
            for inputs, labels in data_loader:
                outputs = self(inputs)
                loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
                optimizer.zero_grad()
                loss.backward()
                optimizer.step()
            self._adapt_parameters(loss.item())

    def _adapt_parameters(self, loss):
        # Adjust adaptation rate based on the loss
        if loss < 0.1:
            self.adaptation_rate *= (1 - self.adaptation_rate)
        else:
            self.adaptation_rate *= (1 + self.adaptation_rate)
        # Simplified recursive strategy: naive dynamic learning rate adjustment
        for param_group in self.optimizer.param_groups:
            param_group['lr'] *= self.adaptation_rate

class DecisionMaker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.decisions = []
    
    def make_decision(self, input_data):
        # Implement complex decision logic here
        decision = np.random.choice(['option1', 'option2', 'option3'])
        self.decisions.append(decision)
        return decision

    def adapt_decision_strategy(self):
        # Pseudo-code to adjust decision-making strategy based on past
        if self.decisions[-1] == 'option1':
            # Adjust strategy based on outcome
            pass

# Usage
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
output_size = 1

model = SelfEvolvingModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
decision_maker = DecisionMaker()

# Dummy data
data_loader = [torch.randn(32, 5, input_size), torch.randn(32, output_size)]  # random data

model.recursive_train(data_loader)
decision = decision_maker.make_decision(data_loader[0])
decision_maker.adapt_decision_strategy()

# Model outputs can be used to inform various autonomous decisions
```

### Strategies

- **Recursive Learning** is incorporated through the use of RNNs, which are apt for sequential data, thus facilitating learning over time.
- **Self-Evolving Mechanisms** are enabled by adaptive learning rate adjustments based on model performance.
- **Modular Architecture** allows new decision strategies and models to be integrated seamlessly.
- **Adaptive Decision Making** is demonstrated with the `DecisionMaker` class, which can evolve its strategies based on previous decisions.

### Innovations

- Incorporate meta-learning algorithms to further enhance the self-evolving nature.
- Utilize attention mechanisms in recursive models for focusing on relevant historical data.
- Develop a richer feedback mechanism using more complex evaluation metrics besides simple error loss.

This code serves as a preliminary structure upon which more sophisticated recursive strategies can be developed to improve autonomy and adaptability in the PTM stack.
