Designing a Python module for the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves incorporating innovative recursive strategies that enable the system to learn and adapt continuously. Below is a conceptual outline and a basic structure for such a module. The module is designed to be extensible, enabling the incorporation of advanced machine learning models and recursive algorithms.

### Module Name: `PTM_Autonomy`

#### Key Features
1. **Recursive Learning**: Implement a recursive learning algorithm that refines its strategies based on previous outcomes and new data.
2. **Adaptive Data Processing**: Dynamically adjusts data processing pipelines based on incoming data characteristics.
3. **Modular Architecture**: Ensure the system is modular, allowing for easy integration of new components and technologies.
4. **Self-Optimization**: The system self-optimizes its operation using feedback loops.

#### Structure

```python
# PTM_Autonomy/__init__.py
from .data_processor import DataProcessor
from .recursive_strategy import RecursiveStrategy
from .self_learner import SelfLearner

__all__ = ["DataProcessor", "RecursiveStrategy", "SelfLearner"]
```

### Core Components

#### 1. Data Processor
This component handles data ingestion and preprocessing.

```python
# PTM_Autonomy/data_processor.py
class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialization for data processing parameters
        pass

    def adapt_pipeline(self, data):
        # Dynamically modify data pipeline based on data characteristics
        print("Adapting data pipeline...")
        # Implement pipeline adaptation logic here

    def preprocess(self, data):
        # Perform data preprocessing
        print("Preprocessing data...")
        # Implement preprocessing steps here
        self.adapt_pipeline(data)
        return data
```

#### 2. Recursive Strategy
Utilizes recursive algorithms to improve decision-making processes.

```python
# PTM_Autonomy/recursive_strategy.py
class RecursiveStrategy:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialization for recursive strategy parameters
        pass

    def execute_strategy(self, context):
        # Implement a recursive strategy
        print("Executing recursive strategy...")
        # Implement recursive decision making here
        self.refine_strategy(context)

    def refine_strategy(self, context):
        # Use feedback to recursively refine strategy
        print("Refining strategy...")
        # Implement strategy refinement logic
```

#### 3. Self Learner
Implements continuous learning and adaptation over time.

```python
# PTM_Autonomy/self_learner.py
class SelfLearner:
    def __init__(self, data_processor, recursive_strategy):
        self.data_processor = data_processor
        self.recursive_strategy = recursive_strategy

    def learn(self, data):
        # Adaptive learning
        print("Learning from data...")
        processed_data = self.data_processor.preprocess(data)
        self.recursive_strategy.execute_strategy(processed_data)

    def self_optimize(self):
        # Implement self-optimization via feedback loops
        print("Optimizing operations...")
        # Use feedback loops here
```

### Usage Example

```python
from PTM_Autonomy import DataProcessor, RecursiveStrategy, SelfLearner

# Create instances of components
data_processor = DataProcessor()
recursive_strategy = RecursiveStrategy()
self_learner = SelfLearner(data_processor, recursive_strategy)

# Simulate incoming data
incoming_data = {"sensor_data": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]}

# Execute learning and optimization
self_learner.learn(incoming_data)
self_learner.self_optimize()
```

### Notes
- **Recursive Learning**: Implement recursive patterns where the output influences the next round of processing, creating a feedback loop.
- **Modular Design**: Allows incorporation of advanced models like neural networks for specific tasks such as data pattern recognition or anomaly detection.
- **Self-Optimization**: Implements techniques such as genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning to improve decision-making and operational efficiency continually.

This design is conceptual and can be further expanded with more sophisticated algorithm implementations using libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.
