Creating a new Python module for the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical empire or organization) to expand its self-evolving autonomy stack involves implementing innovative recursive strategies that facilitate adaptive decision-making, optimization, and scalability. Below is a conceptual design for such a module:

### Module Overview: `ptm_autonomy`

The `ptm_autonomy` module will provide tools for recursive learning, decision making, and optimization. It leverages recursive structures and concepts like genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning, and adaptive feedback loops to ensure the PTM empire's systems can evolve and adapt autonomously over time.

### Features:

1. **Recursive Learning Framework**:
   - Implements recursive neural networks for pattern recognition.
   - Allows systems to learn hierarchical structures and dependencies in data.

2. **Genetic Algorithms**:
   - Provides tools for evolving solutions to optimization problems using genetic principles.
   - Recursive approach to handle multi-layered problem spaces, ensuring adaptability and robustness.

3. **Reinforcement Learning Agents**:
   - Develops agents that use recursive policies to optimize actions over time.
   - Incorporation of self-play and dynamic environment adaptation.

4. **Feedback Loop Systems**:
   - Adaptive feedback mechanisms to fine-tune system performance.
   - Recursive adjustments based on performance metrics and outcomes.

5. **Scalable Architecture**:
   - Ensures systems can expand and integrate new capabilities without major overhauls.
   - Recursive module loading and functions to facilitate seamless updates.

### Sample Code:

Below is an illustrative outline of how the `ptm_autonomy` module could be implemented in Python.

```python
# ptm_autonomy/__init__.py
# Initialize the module and import necessary components
from .recursive_learning import RecursiveNeuralNetwork
from .genetic_algorithm import GeneticOptimizer
from .rl_agent import ReinforcementAgent
from .adaptive_feedback import FeedbackSystem

# ptm_autonomy/recursive_learning.py
class RecursiveNeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_layers):
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.hidden_layers = hidden_layers
        self.model = self._build_model()

    def _build_model(self):
        # Implementation of a recursive neural network structure
        pass

    def train(self, data, labels):
        # Train the network using input data and labels
        pass

    def predict(self, data):
        # Perform inference with the trained network
        pass

# ptm_autonomy/genetic_algorithm.py
class GeneticOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, population_size, mutation_rate):
        self.population_size = population_size
        self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate

    def evolve(self, generations, fitness_function):
        # Evolve solutions across multiple generations
        pass

# ptm_autonomy/rl_agent.py
class ReinforcementAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_space, action_space):
        self.state_space = state_space
        self.action_space = action_space

    def train(self, environment, episodes):
        # Train the agent in the given environment
        pass

    def act(self, state):
        # Decide on an action based on the current state
        pass

# ptm_autonomy/adaptive_feedback.py
class FeedbackSystem:
    def __init__(self, initial_state):
        self.state = initial_state

    def adjust(self, performance_metrics):
        # Modify internal parameters based on feedback
        pass

    def report(self):
        # Generate status reports from feedback analysis
        pass
```

### Usage Example:

```python
from ptm_autonomy import RecursiveNeuralNetwork, GeneticOptimizer, ReinforcementAgent, FeedbackSystem

# Initialize components
rnn = RecursiveNeuralNetwork(input_size=100, hidden_layers=[50, 25, 10])
genetic_optimizer = GeneticOptimizer(population_size=100, mutation_rate=0.01)
rl_agent = ReinforcementAgent(state_space=10, action_space=4)
feedback_system = FeedbackSystem(initial_state={})

# Example operations
rnn.train(data, labels)
optimized_solution = genetic_optimizer.evolve(100, fitness_function)
rl_agent.train(environment, 1000)
feedback_system.adjust(performance_metrics)
```

This conceptual module sets a foundation for expanding the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack by integrating recursive strategies in a user-friendly and scalable manner. By employing machine learning algorithms, genetic optimizations, and reinforcement strategies, the PTM empire can enhance its adaptive capabilities effectively.
