Designing a Python module for an evolving autonomy stack within the PTM (Presumably-Technical-Model) empire involves creating a system that can adapt, learn, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Recursive strategies will be central to this, allowing the system to iteratively enhance its performance and decision-making abilities. Below is a conceptual design and a basic outline of such a module:

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Recursive Learning**: Implement techniques to allow the system to learn from its successes and failures. This includes reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms.
2. **Hierarchical Decision Making**: Create a hierarchy of decision-making processes that recursively evaluate outcomes.
3. **Self-Optimizing Nodes**: Nodes in the system are capable of assessing their performance and optimizing themselves autonomously.

#### Components:

- **Agent Class**: Manages state and behavior of autonomous agents.
- **Environment Class**: Simulates the setting in which the agents operate.
- **RecursiveOptimizer**: Employs recursive strategies to optimize decisions and performance.
- **Evolutionary Learning**: Implements genetic algorithms for evolving agent strategies.
- **DecisionTree**: A recursive decision-making framework.

#### Python Module Structure:

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name, initial_state):
        self.name = name
        self.state = initial_state

    def perceive_environment(self, environment):
        # Logic to perceive and update internal state
        pass

    def decide(self, environment):
        # Logic to make decisions based on current internal state
        pass

    def act(self, decision):
        # Logic to act on the decision made
        pass

class Environment:
    def __init__(self, parameters):
        self.parameters = parameters
    
    def update_state(self, actions):
        # Logic to update environment state based on agent actions
        pass

class RecursiveOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, agents, environment):
        self.agents = agents
        self.environment = environment
    
    def optimize(self):
        for agent in self.agents:
            environment_perception = agent.perceive_environment(self.environment)
            decision = agent.decide(environment_perception)
            agent.act(decision)
            # Implement recursive optimization
            self.recursive_improvement(agent)

    def recursive_improvement(self, agent):
        # Recursive strategy to improve agent's performance
        pass

class EvolutionaryLearning:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        self.agents = agents

    def evolve(self):
        # Evaluate current agent performances
        # Generate new generations to improve overall agent performance
        pass

class DecisionTree:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize tree structure
        pass

    def make_decision(self, state):
        # Recursive decision-making logic
        pass

def self_evolving_strategy(agents, environment):
    # High-level function to implement self-evolving strategy
    recursive_optimizer = RecursiveOptimizer(agents, environment)
    evolutionary_learning = EvolutionaryLearning(agents)

    while True:  # Continuous self-evolving loop
        recursive_optimizer.optimize()
        evolutionary_learning.evolve()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize agents, environment, and strategy
    agents = [Agent("Agent1", initial_state={}), Agent("Agent2", initial_state={})]
    environment = Environment(parameters={})

    self_evolving_strategy(agents, environment)
```

### Features & Strategies:

1. **Recursive Improvement in `RecursiveOptimizer`**: Each agent utilizes a recursive function to assess its actions' impact and refine its strategy continuously.
2. **Evolutionary Learning**: Innovatively uses selection, crossover, and mutation to optimize agent behaviors iteratively.
3. **Decision Trees**: Recursive decision trees facilitate complex decision-making processes, allowing agents to predict outcomes and strategize efficiently.

This module provides a robust framework for creating autonomous systems that can learn and adapt recursively, maintaining an evolving equilibrium in diverse operational environments. Through continuous feedback loops and evolutionary techniques, the PTM empire's autonomy stack can remain at the cutting edge of autonomous innovation.
