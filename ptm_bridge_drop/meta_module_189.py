Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional entity for this context) empireâ€™s self-evolving autonomy stack requires incorporating advanced concepts such as recursive algorithms, machine learning, and potential integration with existing AI frameworks. Below, I'll outline a conceptual approach and include a basic Python module structure to elucidate these ideas.

### Conceptual Framework

1. **Recursive Learning Strategies**:
    - Implement recursive strategies where models not only are trained but can also adapt over time through self-assessment and re-training.
    - Utilize reinforcement learning to allow the AI to improve based on feedback loops.

2. **Modular Integration**:
    - Design the module to enable seamless integration with existing systems and allow easy updates or additions to the stack.
    - Ensure that individual components can be developed independently and integrated without massive refactoring.

3. **Self-assessment Mechanisms**:
    - Embed metrics and self-diagnostic tools within the module to monitor performance.
    - The system should be able to identify when recalibration or re-training is necessary and execute those processes autonomously.

4. **Adaptive Decision-Making Framework**:
    - Implement decision trees combined with neural networks to support complex decision-making processes that evolve with new data inputs.

### Python Module Structure

Here's a simplified version of what such a module might look like:

```python
import numpy as np
import logging
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class RecursiveAutoStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.neural_net = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(50,), max_iter=1000)
        self.decision_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier()
        self.performance_metrics = {}
        self.training_data = None
        self.labels = None

    def load_data(self, data, labels):
        self.training_data = data
        self.labels = labels
        logging.info("Data loaded: %d samples", len(data))

    def initial_train(self):
        """Initial training phase with preset data"""
        logging.info("Starting initial training...")
        self.neural_net.fit(self.training_data, self.labels)
        self.decision_tree.fit(self.training_data, self.labels)

    def recursive_train(self):
        """Recursive strategy to fine-tune the models"""
        logging.info("Running recursive training...")
        pred_labels = self.neural_net.predict(self.training_data)
        
        # Evaluate performance
        accuracy = np.mean(pred_labels == self.labels)
        logging.info("Current Accuracy: %.2f", accuracy)
        
        self.performance_metrics['accuracy'] = accuracy
        
        if accuracy < 0.9:  # Condition to trigger retraining
            logging.info("Retraining neural network model for improvement...")
            # Assumption: new data may have been appended
            self.neural_net.fit(self.training_data, self.labels)
            self.performance_metrics['accuracy'] = np.mean(self.neural_net.predict(self.training_data) == self.labels)

    def assess_and_evolve(self):
        """Self-assessment and evolution"""
        logging.info("Assessing model performance...")
        if self.performance_metrics['accuracy'] < 0.85:
            logging.info("Performance below threshold, evolving model...")
            self.recursive_train()

    def make_decision(self, input_data):
        """Decision-making using the decision tree model"""
        decision = self.decision_tree.predict([input_data])
        logging.info("Decision made: %s", decision)
        return decision

# Example of using the module
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Sample data
    sample_data = np.random.rand(100, 5)
    sample_labels = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(100,))
    
    auto_stack = RecursiveAutoStack()
    auto_stack.load_data(sample_data, sample_labels)
    auto_stack.initial_train()
    auto_stack.assess_and_evolve()

    # Test decision making
    test_input = np.random.rand(5)
    auto_stack.make_decision(test_input)
```

### Key Components Explained

1. **Neural Network and Decision Tree**: The module uses a neural network for classifications and a decision tree for decision-making, reflecting adaptability and complexity.
2. **Recursive Training**: Regularly evaluates performance metrics and retrains the model if accuracy falls below a threshold, promoting self-evolution.
3. **Autonomy with Logging**: Uses Python's logging module to keep track of processes and decisions, supporting transparency and debugging.

### Further Enhancements

- **Adaptive learning rates**: Use various learning rates based on model feedback loops.
- **Integration with other ML frameworks**: Leverage TensorFlow or PyTorch for more complex models.
- **Scalable Data Pipelines**: Implement adaptive data pipelines that can handle real-time data influx and processing.

The actual implementation will undoubtedly require comprehensive testing, performance optimization, and fine-tuning to ensure robust and efficient operation in a real-world scenario.
