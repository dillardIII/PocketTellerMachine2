Designing a new Python module for the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical autonomous system) empireâ€™s self-evolving autonomy stack involves incorporating recursive strategies that enable the system to intelligently learn, adapt, and make decisions over time. Here's a high-level design with some ideas on how this could be implemented:

### Module: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Key Objectives
1. **Recursive Learning**: Implement algorithms that allow continuous self-improvement through recursive learning mechanisms.
2. **Adaptive Decision Making**: Utilize strategies that enable flexible and context-aware decision-making.
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Employ predictive models that anticipate future states and outcomes to improve planning.
4. **Scalability**: Ensure the system can handle increased complexity and data without degradation of performance.
5. **Modular Design**: Provide an extensible framework that can incorporate new features and improvements easily.

#### Core Components

1. **Recursive Learning Engine**
   - Uses a combination of neural networks and reinforcement learning to recursively update its models.
   - Tracks performance metrics and iteratively refines strategies to optimize outcomes.

2. **Adaptive Decision Module**
   - Employs a blend of decision trees and Bayesian networks to make real-time decisions based on current data.
   - Integrates a feedback loop to refine decision parameters.

3. **Predictive Analytics Component**
   - Utilizes time-series forecasting and anomaly detection to predict future states.
   - Incorporates Monte Carlo simulations to explore a range of possible outcomes and identify optimal strategies.

4. **Data Integration Layer**
   - Aggregates data from multiple sensors and sources to provide a comprehensive view of the environment.
   - Implements a real-time data processing pipeline using Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for seamless communication.

5. **User Interface and Monitoring Dashboard**
   - A visualization layer using libraries like `Dash` or `Bokeh` to present insights and system health metrics.
   - Offers control knobs for manually fine-tuning system parameters and observing the impact of changes.

#### Pseudo-code Example

```python
class PTMAutonomy:

    def __init__(self):
        self.recursive_learning_engine = RecursiveLearningEngine()
        self.adaptive_decision_module = AdaptiveDecisionModule()
        self.predictive_analytics_component = PredictiveAnalyticsComponent()
        
    def recursive_evaluate(self, data):
        metrics = self.recursive_learning_engine.evaluate(data)
        self.adaptive_decision_module.update(metrics)
        return metrics

    def adaptive_decision_making(self, context):
        decision = self.adaptive_decision_module.decide(context)
        return decision

    def forecast_future_states(self, input_data):
        prediction = self.predictive_analytics_component.predict(input_data)
        return prediction

class RecursiveLearningEngine:
    
    def evaluate(self, data):
        # Implement neural network training with reinforcement learning
        # to recursively improve based on feedback
        performance_metrics = self.train_neural_network(data)
        return performance_metrics

class AdaptiveDecisionModule:
    
    def decide(self, context):
        # Use decision trees and Bayesian logic to make decisions
        decision = self.analyze_context(context)
        self.update_decision_logic()
        return decision
    
    def update(self, metrics):
        # Adjust internal models based on performance metrics 
        pass

class PredictiveAnalyticsComponent:
    
    def predict(self, input_data):
        # Perform time-series forecasting or Monte Carlo simulations
        future_state = self.run_forecasting_models(input_data)
        return future_state

# More classes like DataIntegrationLayer and MonitoringDashboard would be defined here ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    autonomy_system = PTMAutonomy()
    initial_data = load_initial_data()
    autonomy_system.recursive_evaluate(initial_data)
    context = gather_context_data()
    decision = autonomy_system.adaptive_decision_making(context)
    prediction = autonomy_system.forecast_future_states(context)
    log(decision, prediction)
```

This module provides a scaffold that implements an autonomous learning and decision-making stack with recursive strategies. Each of these components can be further expanded and refined to incorporate the latest advancements in AI and machine learning.
