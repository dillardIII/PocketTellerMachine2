Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating machine learning, automation, and recursive strategies for continuous self-improvement. Below is a conceptual design for such a module. The module, named `ptm_autonomy`, will focus on integrating autonomous decision-making capabilities with self-improvement mechanisms.

### Module Design: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Key Features
1. **Recursive Self-Improvement**: Implement strategies for the system to iteratively evaluate and enhance its own performance.
2. **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Use machine learning models to enable autonomous decisions based on the current state and historical data.
3. **Feedback Loop Integration**: Include a feedback loop mechanism to leverage outcomes for improving subsequent decision-making processes.
4. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Allow the system to dynamically adapt to new information or changing environments.

#### Core Components

1. **Performance Evaluator**
   - Evaluates the current performance of the autonomy stack.
   - Generates metrics that are fed back into the system for analysis.

2. **Learning Engine**
   - Implements machine learning algorithms, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Learning (DL), to facilitate autonomous learning.
   - Supports online learning for real-time adaptation.

3. **Decision Module**
   - Utilizes trained models to make decisions in autonomous contexts.
   - Integrates a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework for complex decision-making scenarios.

4. **Improvement Strategy**
   - Contains recursive algorithms for iterating over existing models with new data or methods.
   - Can simulate and analyze multiple strategies for performance enhancement.

5. **Environment Interface**
   - Abstracts interactions with the external environment and feeds sensory data into the system for processing.

6. **User Feedback System**
   - Allows for user interactions and feedback to guide learning and adaptation priorities.

#### Example Structure

```python
# Module: ptm_autonomy

import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import logging

class PerformanceEvaluator:
    def evaluate(self, model, X_test, y_test):
        predictions = model.predict(X_test)
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
        logging.info(f'Performance: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')
        return accuracy

class LearningEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier()

    def train(self, X, y):
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        return X_test, y_test

class DecisionModule:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model

    def make_decision(self, data):
        return self.model.predict(data)

class ImprovementStrategy:
    def recursive_improvement(self, evaluator, engine, X, y):
        improvement_target = 0.95  # Example target accuracy threshold
        while True:
            X_test, y_test = engine.train(X, y)
            performance = evaluator.evaluate(engine.model, X_test, y_test)
            if performance >= improvement_target:
                logging.info('Improvement target reached.')
                break
            logging.info('Running recursive improvement...')
            # Recursive strategy to modify model hyperparameters
            engine.model.n_estimators += 10

# Usage Example

def main():
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

    # Example data
    X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
    y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

    evaluator = PerformanceEvaluator()
    engine = LearningEngine()
    strategy = ImprovementStrategy()

    strategy.recursive_improvement(evaluator, engine, X, y)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Additional Considerations
- **Scalability**: Ensure that the module can scale with increased data input.
- **Robustness**: Include error handling mechanisms and debugging information.
- **Extensibility**: Design the module with an architecture that supports easy integration of new algorithms or strategies.

This design outlines the core architecture of the `ptm_autonomy` module, highlighting recursive improvement strategies and autonomous decision-making capabilities vital for evolving the PTM empire’s autonomy stack.
