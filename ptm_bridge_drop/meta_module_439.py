Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably something like 'Perceptron Transition Model' although the acronym might stand for something different in your context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies is quite an ambitious task. Below I'll outline a conceptual design for the module and provide some snippets of Python code to illustrate how it could be implemented.

For the self-evolving autonomy stack, we might focus on mechanisms such as:

1. Self-learning and adaptation: Implementing algorithms that allow the system to learn from data continuously and adapt to changes in the environment.
2. Recursive strategy development: Using recursive algorithms to build increasingly complex strategies based on simpler ones.
3. Feedback loops: Incorporating systems that provide feedback for updating models and strategies.
4. Modularity and extensibility: Designing the architecture so new components can be plugged in without disrupting existing systems.

**Module Design Concept**

Let's name our module `ptm_autonomy_stack`. Below is an outline of its structure:

- `data_collection.py`: Module to handle data acquisition and storage.
- `self_learning.py`: Module handling the self-learning process using recursive techniques.
- `strategy_development.py`: Module that generates and refines strategies.
- `feedback.py`: Module to process feedback and update models.

### 1. `data_collection.py`

This module would handle inputs from various sensors and data sources.

```python
class DataCollector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_sources = []

    def add_data_source(self, source):
        self.data_sources.append(source)

    def collect_data(self):
        data = []
        for source in self.data_sources:
            data.append(source.get_data())
        return data
```

### 2. `self_learning.py`

This module manages self-learning mechanisms, possibly using reinforcement learning with recursive applications.

```python
import numpy as np

class SelfLearningModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = None
        
    def train(self, data):
        # Recursive learning strategy could be applied here
        if self.model is None:
            self.model = self._initialize_model(data)
        else:
            self._update_model(data)
    
    def _initialize_model(self, data):
        # Some model initialization logic
        pass
        
    def _update_model(self, data):
        # Update model logic with recursive techniques
        pass
```

### 3. `strategy_development.py`

A module focusing on building strategies recursively.

```python
class Strategy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategies = []

    def add_strategy(self, strategy_func):
        self.strategies.append(strategy_func)

    def execute_all(self):
        results = []
        for strategy in self.strategies:
            results.append(self._recursive_execute(strategy))
        return results

    def _recursive_execute(self, strategy):
        # Implementation of recursive strategy execution
        return strategy()
```

### 4. `feedback.py`

Handles feedback for real-time adjustment and improvement.

```python
class FeedbackProcessor:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model

    def process_feedback(self, feedback):
        # Logic to convert feedback into model adjustments
        self.model.update(feedback)

    def generate_feedback(self, data):
        # Generate feedback for improving model/strategies
        return self.model.evaluate(data)
```

### Integration

To integrate these components into a cohesive autonomy stack, you might create a central controller.

```python
class PTMAutonomyController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_collector = DataCollector()
        self.learning_model = SelfLearningModel()
        self.strategy_dev = Strategy()
        self.feedback_proc = FeedbackProcessor(self.learning_model)

    def run_cycle(self):
        data = self.data_collector.collect_data()
        self.learning_model.train(data)
        strategies = self.strategy_dev.execute_all()
        feedback = self.feedback_proc.generate_feedback(data)
        self.feedback_proc.process_feedback(feedback)

    def add_strategy(self, strategy_func):
        self.strategy_dev.add_strategy(strategy_func)

# Example usage
controller = PTMAutonomyController()
controller.add_strategy(lambda: np.random.rand())  # Adding a dummy strategy
controller.run_cycle()
```

### Notes

- The above code is a high-level blueprint; implementation of model training, feedback mechanisms, strategy formulation, etc., requires precise domain knowledge.
- Recursive strategy development could particularly benefit from methods like recursive neural networks, divide-and-conquer strategies, etc.
- Real-world implementation will require dealing with concurrency, fault tolerance, scaling, and possibly real-time constraints.

This conceptual design invites innovations and deeper exploration around each component, adapting them based on specific needs and characteristics of the PTM empire's goals.
