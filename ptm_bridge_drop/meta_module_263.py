Creating a Python module to enhance the autonomy stack of a theoretical empire like PTM requires a blend of advanced AI techniques, system-level integration, and robust recursive strategies. Below is a conceptual design and implementation plan for such a module. Note that this is a high-level overview and would require detailed specifications and knowledge about the existing PTM systems for full integration.

### Module Name
`SelfEvolvingAutonomy`

### Key Features
1. **Recursive Learning and Adaptation**:
   - Use recursive neural networks (RNNs) and transformers to process temporal data for autonomous behavior adaptations.
   - Implement a feedback mechanism to continuously assess and refine strategies based on environmental interactions.

2. **Hierarchical Decision-Making**:
   - Establish a hierarchy of decision layers, from tactical to strategic, each with its recursive improvement loop.
   - Implement distributed decision nodes that enable localized quick responses and upper-layer strategic oversight.

3. **Self-Healing Systems**:
   - Develop mechanisms for detecting anomalies and auto-correcting them with minimal human intervention.
   - Use generative models to simulate potential failure scenarios and preemptively adjust strategies.

4. **Collaborative Intelligence**:
   - Enable communication between autonomous agents for coordinated task execution.
   - Use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize joint tasks and resource allocation.

5. **Dynamic Resource Management**:
   - Implement predictive models for energy consumption and logistical needs.
   - Use a time-series forecasting algorithm for optimal resource allocation and inventory management.

```python
# self_evolving_autonomy.py

import numpy as np
import torch
import random
from torch import nn
from torch.optim import Adam
from collections import deque

# Basic RNN-based Learner for continuous adaptation
class RecursiveLearner(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(RecursiveLearner, self).__init__()
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.rnn(x)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])  # Take the last output
        return out

# Multi-Agent Collaborative Strategy
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id
        self.position = np.random.rand(2)  # Example: 2D position
    
    def communicate(self, agents):
        # Simple example of communication between agents
        neighbors = [agent for agent in agents if np.linalg.norm(agent.position - self.position) < 1.0]
        return neighbors

# Self-Healing Strategy
class AnomalyDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = deque(maxlen=100)  # Keeping track of a sliding window of data

    def detect(self, data_point):
        self.history.append(data_point)
        if len(self.history) > 10:
            # Simple anomaly detection logic
            mean = np.mean(self.history)
            stddev = np.std(self.history)
            if abs(data_point - mean) > 2 * stddev:
                return True
        return False
    
    def auto_correct(self):
        # Placeholder for auto-correction mechanism
        return "Correction Applied"

# Example usage
def main():
    # Instantiate recursive learner
    learner = RecursiveLearner(input_size=10, hidden_size=50, output_size=5)
    
    # Sample data for adaptation (e.g., sensor readings)
    sample_data = torch.randn((1, 10, 10))
    output = learner(sample_data)
    print(f"Model output: {output}")

    # Example of agent communication
    agents = [Agent(id=i) for i in range(10)]
    for agent in agents:
        neighbors = agent.communicate(agents)
        print(f"Agent {agent.id} has {len(neighbors)} neighbors")

    # Anomaly detection
    detector = AnomalyDetector()
    for _ in range(20):
        data_point = random.uniform(0, 1)
        if detector.detect(data_point):
            print(detector.auto_correct())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **RecursiveLearner**: A simple RNN-based module that can be expanded with more complex RNN architectures or transformers for better sequence handling and decision-making.

2. **Agent Communication**: Demonstrates basic peer-to-peer communication, which is crucial for coordination across agents.

3. **AnomalyDetector**: Provides a basic pattern for anomaly detection using simple statistical methods and can be replaced with more sophisticated methods like autoencoders.

This module blueprint could form part of a larger suite in the PTM empireâ€™s autonomy stack, with further integration into a real-time system and leveraging domain-specific data for training autonomous agents. The use of multi-agent learning, recursive strategy implementation, and self-healing mechanisms provide a robust foundation for advanced autonomy.
