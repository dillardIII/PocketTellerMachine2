Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "PTM" stands for something specific in your context, such as an organization or a system) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack would involve several key considerations. Firstly, we need to ensure modularity, scalability, and adaptability. Recursive strategies can be particularly powerful for tasks that involve self-improvement, learning, and problem-solving.

Here's a conceptual outline of how you could design such a module using Python. The module will feature a recursive learning component, which allows the system to evaluate and improve itself iteratively.

### Folder Structure

```
ptm_autonomy/
    __init__.py
    strategies.py
    recursive_learning.py
    environment.py
    metrics.py
    agent.py
    utils.py
```

### `__init__.py`
This will allow you to import the functionality from the module easily.

```python
from .strategies import Strategy
from .recursive_learning import RecursiveLearner
from .environment import Environment
from .metrics import Metrics
from .agent import Agent
```

### `strategies.py`
Define innovative recursive strategies for autonomy.

```python
class Strategy:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def plan(self, state):
        """ Plans the next move based on the current state. """
        raise NotImplementedError("Implement planning algorithm.")

    def execute(self):
        """ Executes a planned strategy. """
        raise NotImplementedError("Implement execution logic.")

    def evaluate(self):
        """ Evaluates the effectiveness of the strategy. """
        raise NotImplementedError("Implement evaluation process.")

```

### `recursive_learning.py`
Implement the core recursive learning logic.

```python
class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, strategy):
        self.strategy = strategy

    def learn(self, environment):
        """ Recursive learning implementation. """
        for iteration in range(100):  # Number of recursive cycles
            state = environment.get_state()
            self.strategy.plan(state)
            self.strategy.execute()
            outcome = environment.observe_outcome()
            self.strategy.evaluate()
            if self.converged(outcome):
                print(f"Converged after {iteration} iterations")
                break
        return self.strategy

    def converged(self, outcome):
        """ Check convergence criteria. """
        # Your convergence logic here
        return False
```

### `environment.py`
Define the interaction with the environment.

```python
class Environment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = self.initial_state()

    def initial_state(self):
        """ Initialize the environment state. """
        return {}

    def get_state(self):
        """ Return current state of the environment. """
        return self.state

    def observe_outcome(self):
        """ Simulates feedback from the environment. """
        # Simulate some outcome or feedback loop
        return {}
```

### `metrics.py`
Track and measure the performance of strategies.

```python
class Metrics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = []

    def log(self, info):
        """ Log metrics data. """
        self.data.append(info)

    def analyze(self):
        """ Analyze logged data to generate insights. """
        # Implement analytical logic here
        return {}
```

### `agent.py`
The agent interacts with the environment, learning and adapting via recursive strategies.

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, strategy):
        self.strategy = strategy

    def act(self, environment):
        """ React to the environment using strategy. """
        learner = RecursiveLearner(self.strategy)
        optimized_strategy = learner.learn(environment)
        # Implement how the agent uses the optimized strategy
```

### `utils.py`
Utility functions and helpers.

```python
# Include helper functions that support other modules
def some_helper_function():
    pass
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each component such as strategies, learning, environment, and agents is in its module, allowing independent development and testing.

2. **Scalability**: The stack is designed to be scalable by adding more strategies or integrating different types of environments.

3. **Adaptability**: Recursive strategies enhance the system's ability to self-evolve by continually learning and optimizing its performance.

4. **Recursive Learning**: By defining convergence criteria, the system can determine when it's reached a satisfactory solution to a problem, or when more iterations are necessary.

5. **Feedback Loops**: Use feedback from the environment to evaluate and refine strategies continuously.

When implementing such a system, ensure you test each part deeply with a variety of scenarios to ensure robustness and adaptability in the real world. Furthermore, you may need to consider ethical implications, safety features, and real-time performance depending on the autonomous tasks this module is intended for.
