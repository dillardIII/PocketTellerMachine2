Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably an abbreviation related to a hypothetical organization or project) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can intelligently adapt, learn, and optimize itself over time. This requires integrating machine learning, particularly in the areas of recursive neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, the module should be designed to allow for easy expandability and modularity.

Here's a high-level design of such a Python module, focusing on innovative recursive strategies:

from auton_evolve.recursive_nn import RecursiveNN
from auton_evolve.evolutionary_algorithms import GeneticAlgorithm
from auton_evolve.reinforcement_agents import DQNAgent
from auton_evolve.self_optimization import Optimizer

# Step 1: Data preparation
data = load_data('data/dataset.csv')
normalized_data = normalize_data(data)

# Step 2: Initialize modules
rnn_model = RecursiveNN()
genetic_algo = GeneticAlgorithm()
rl_agent = DQNAgent()
optimizer = Optimizer()

# Step 3: Train models
rnn_model.train(normalized_data)

### Innovative Recursive Strategies

- **Recursive Feedback Loops:** Implement loops where the output of the neural network or agent informs the next training cycle, allowing for continuous self-improvement.
  
- **Adaptive Learning Rates:** Use meta-learning strategies to recursively adjust learning rates based on model performance.
  
- **Recursive Network Expansion:** Introduce mechanisms for dynamically expanding or contracting network architecture based on performance metrics, determined recursively.

- **Collaborative Co-evolution:** Allow different parts of the system (like RNNs and RL agents) to evolve together, sharing insights and learning from each other recursively.

### Conclusion

This Python module aims to significantly enhance the autonomy and adaptability of the PTM empire's systems through the integration of advanced recursive strategies and modular design. It leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to create a self-evolving architecture.
