To design a new Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical organization or system for this context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack, we would aim to create a system that leverages recursive strategies, multi-agent learning, and continuous adaptation. This would involve utilizing cutting-edge techniques in AI and machine learning, such as reinforcement learning, federated learning, and adaptive neural network architectures.

Below is an outline and sample code for such a Python module:

### Module Design: `SelfEvolvingAutonomy`

#### Components:
1. **Agent Class**: Represents a single autonomous unit capable of learning and adaptation.
2. **Environment Interface**: A standardized interface for different operational environments.
3. **Recursive Learning Framework**: Implements recursive strategies and self-improvement mechanisms.
4. **Federated Learning System**: Allows agents to collaboratively learn while protecting data privacy.
5. **Adaptation Mechanism**: Adjusts behaviors and strategies based on environmental feedback.

#### Key Features:
- **Recursive Strategies**: Implement recursive functions where outputs of one cycle inform inputs to the next.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Enable communication and collaboration among autonomous agents.
- **Self-Improvement**: Leverage past experiences for continuous model updates.
- **Scalability**: Design to support scaling across numerous environments and scenarios.

### Sample Code Implementation

```python
import random
import numpy as np
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import List, Any

# Environment Interface
class Environment(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def reset(self):
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def step(self, action):
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def is_done(self):
        pass

# Simple Example Environment
class SimpleEnvironment(Environment):
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = 0
    
    def reset(self):
        self.state = 0
    
    def step(self, action):
        self.state += action
        return self.state, self.is_done()  # Return (state, done)
    
    def is_done(self):
        return self.state >= 10

# Agent Class with Recursive Learning Strategy
class Agent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value_table = {}
    
    def choose_action(self, state):
        return random.choice([-1, 1])  # Actions: Decrement or Increment

    def update_value_table(self, state, reward):
        self.value_table[state] = self.value_table.get(state, 0) + reward

    def recursive_learn(self, state):
        action = self.choose_action(state)
        new_state, done = env.step(action)
        reward = 1 if done else 0
        self.update_value_table(state, reward)

        # Recursive learning
        if not done:
            self.recursive_learn(new_state)
    
    def run(self, environment: Environment, episodes: int):
        for _ in range(episodes):
            state = environment.reset()
            self.recursive_learn(state)

# Control Function
def train_agents(agents: List[Agent], environment: Environment, episodes: int):
    for agent in agents:
        agent.run(environment, episodes)

# Federation of Agents to leverage Federated Learning protocols (Placeholder)
class FederatedLearningSystem:
    def __init__(self, agents: List[Agent]):
        self.agents = agents

    def aggregate_updates(self):
        # Placeholder for aggregation logic
        pass

# Usage Example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    env = SimpleEnvironment()
    agents = [Agent() for _ in range(5)]
    train_agents(agents, env, 100)  # Train with recursive learning
```

### Considerations and Further Enhancements:
1. **Complex Environments**: Implement more sophisticated environments suitable for high-dimensional data.
2. **Deep Q-Learning**: Integrate neural networks to approximate Q-values for complex decision spaces.
3. **Federated Learning Protocols**: Implement secure aggregation methods to enhance data privacy and model robustness.
4. **Adaptive Architectures**: Design neural networks capable of structural changes based on environmental feedback.

This module showcases a basic recursive learning mechanism within a simplified environment. Extending this with complex environments, enhanced learning strategies, and federated protocols will allow the PTM empire to leverage self-evolving systems effectively.
