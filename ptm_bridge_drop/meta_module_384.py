Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "Phoenix Tech Movement" or "Prime Tech Management", etc.) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating components that focus on learning, adaptation, and recursive improvement. Below, I'll outline a high-level design for such a module with innovative recursive strategies:

### Python Module: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Key Components:

1. **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing:**
   - Collects and preprocesses data from various sensors and inputs.
   - Uses recursive feature elimination to prioritize input features dynamically based on their predictive power.

2. **Recursive Learning Core:**
   - Implements a self-improving core learning algorithm using recursive neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data processing and prediction.
   - Incorporates a reinforcement learning agent to adapt policies based on feedback loops.
   - Utilizes meta-learning strategies for learning-to-learn, continuously updating the model's architecture and parameters recursively.

3. **Self-Optimization Module:**
   - A genetic algorithm-based optimizer that fine-tunes model hyperparameters in a recursive manner.
   - Uses evolutionary strategies to select the best-performing model architectures from a population of models.

4. **Autonomous Decision Engine:**
   - Implements a multi-agent system that uses recursive reasoning updated with Bayesian inference for robust decision-making.
   - Integrates model predictive control (MPC) for real-time decision adaptation, accounting for environmental changes.

5. **Feedback and Logging System:**
   - A feedback loop for continuous environment sensing and performance measurement.
   - Recursively logs performance metrics and uses them for tuning the learning algorithms.

6. **Communications Interface:**
   - Implements a recursive protocol for securing and optimizing communications between different parts of the autonomy stack and external entities.

#### Example Python Code Outline:

Here's an outline of how the module might look in Python:

```python
# ptm_autonomy/__init__.py

from .data_ingestion import DataIngestion
from .learning_core import RecursiveLearningCore
from .optimization_module import GeneticOptimizer
from .decision_engine import AutonomousDecisionEngine
from .feedback_system import FeedbackLogger
from .communications import CommunicationsInterface

class PTMAutonomySystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_ingestion = DataIngestion()
        self.learning_core = RecursiveLearningCore()
        self.optimizer = GeneticOptimizer()
        self.decision_engine = AutonomousDecisionEngine()
        self.feedback_logger = FeedbackLogger()
        self.comm_interface = CommunicationsInterface()

    def run(self):
        # Recursive loop for self-evolving autonomy.
        while True:
            data = self.data_ingestion.collect_and_preprocess()
            predictions = self.learning_core.learn_and_predict(data)
            self.optimizer.optimize(self.learning_core)
            decisions = self.decision_engine.make_decisions(predictions)
            self.comm_interface.communicate(decisions)
            self.feedback_logger.log_feedback(decisions)
            # Recursive improvement based on feedback.
            self.learning_core.update_model(self.feedback_logger)

```

#### Explanation of Recursive Strategies:

- **Recursive Feature Elimination:** Automatically selects features that contribute most to the target variables, dynamically adjusting which features are fed into the learning core.
  
- **Recursive Neural Networks:** Capable of handling input sequences of varying lengths, making it suitable for cases where data arrives in sequences.

- **Genetic Algorithms and Evolutionary Strategies:** Continuously evolve model architecture, encouraging exploration and exploitation of various neural network topologies.

- **Recursive Feedback Loop:** Constant tuning of models based on logged performance metrics ensures learning becomes progressively more effective over time.

By implementing such recursive strategies, the `ptm_autonomy` module supports the self-evolution aspect of an autonomy stack, enhancing its capability to adapt and improve over time with minimal external intervention.
