Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably referring to an entity in a fictional setting, as PTM-specific details are not publicly known) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can evolve by recursively building upon itself. This concept involves leveraging machine learning, self-improvement algorithms, and meta-learning strategies. Here's a high-level design outline with some example Python code snippets to demonstrate these ideas:

### Module Design

The module aims to include the following core components:

1. **Data Collection & Processing**: Collect and preprocess data from various sources to train and evolve models.
   
2. **Self-Evolving Neural Network**: A neural network that evolves its architecture and parameters over time based on performance and new data.

3. **Recursive Learning Strategy**: Implement recursive strategies where models can use their own outputs to generate new training data and refine their performance.

4. **Meta-Learning**: Use of meta-learning algorithms that allow the model to learn its own learning approach.

5. **Feedback Loop Mechanism**: Implement a feedback loop to continuously improve accuracy and performance metrics.

6. **Automated Analysis and Reporting**: Generate reports and summaries to assess model performance and evolution.

### Code Snippets

#### Data Processing Module

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self, source):
        self.data = pd.read_csv(source)
        self.scaler = StandardScaler()

    def preprocess(self):
        # Example data cleaning and preprocessing
        clean_data = self.data.dropna()  # Remove missing values
        features = self.scaler.fit_transform(clean_data.iloc[:, :-1])
        labels = clean_data.iloc[:, -1]
        return features, labels
```

#### Self-Evolving Neural Network

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam

class SelfEvolvingNetwork:
    def __init__(self, input_dim, initial_layers=[32, 16]):
        self.model = self._build_model(input_dim, initial_layers)

    def _build_model(self, input_dim, layers):
        model = Sequential()
        model.add(Dense(layers[0], input_dim=input_dim, activation='relu'))
        for units in layers[1:]:
            model.add(Dense(units, activation='relu'))
        model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
        model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
        return model

    def evolve(self):
        # Logic to evolve network architecture
        new_layer_size = int(self.model.layers[-1].units * 1.5)
        self.model.add(Dense(new_layer_size, activation='relu'))
        self.model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    def train(self, X, y):
        self.model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)

    def evaluate(self, X, y):
        return self.model.evaluate(X, y)
```

#### Recursive Learning Strategy

```python
class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model

    def recursive_train(self, X, y, epochs=5):
        for epoch in range(epochs):
            print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}/{epochs}")
            self.model.train(X, y)
            predictions = self.model.model.predict(X)
            # Use predictions to generate new training samples
            X, y = self._generate_new_data(X, predictions)

    def _generate_new_data(self, X, predictions):
        # Logic to mutate X and y based on predictions
        mutation_factor = 0.1
        new_X = X + mutation_factor * np.random.randn(*X.shape)
        new_y = (predictions > 0.5).astype(int)
        return new_X, new_y
```

#### Meta-Learning Strategy

```python
class MetaLearner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []

    def optimize_learning_rate(self, model, X, y):
        # Example of a simplistic meta-learning approach
        best_lr = None
        best_accuracy = 0
        for lr in [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]:
            model.model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=lr), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
            model.train(X, y)
            accuracy = model.evaluate(X, y)[1]
            if accuracy > best_accuracy:
                best_accuracy = accuracy
                best_lr = lr
            self.history.append((lr, accuracy))
        return best_lr
```

### Conclusion

This module includes innovative strategies to allow the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack to adapt and improve recursively. The code provides a basic framework for further development and refinement. This concept can be expanded with more sophisticated self-evolution techniques, integration of more advanced meta-learning algorithms like MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning), or using techniques like neuralevolution strategies to enhance the self-evolving model.
