To design a Python module that expands the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical company or could relate to the Path To Mastery) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies, we need to take into account the following components:

1. **Recursive Learning and Decision Making**: Implement mechanisms for recursive learning and decision-making, allowing the system to improve over time.

2. **Data Pipeline & ETL**: Integrate an efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to collect and process data for recursive learning.

3. **Autonomous System Behavior**: Develop behavior models that can autonomously adjust based on new data input and recursive feedback loops.

4. **Self-Optimization**: Include algorithms for self-optimization that improves performance metrics over each iteration.

5. **Monitoring and Feedback Loops**: Set up monitoring systems to assess performance continuously and feed the results back into the system for further iterations.

Below is a conceptual outline of such a module:

```python
# RecursiveAutonomy.py
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class DataPipeline:
    def __init__(self, data_source):
        self.data_source = data_source

    def extract(self):
        # Extraction logic (replace with actual data extraction)
        data = pd.read_csv(self.data_source)
        return data

    def transform(self, data):
        # Transformation logic (e.g., normalization, feature engineering)
        transformed_data = self.normalize(data)
        return transformed_data

    def load(self, data):
        # Load logic (e.g., save transformed data to a database)
        data.to_csv('transformed_data.csv', index=False)

    def normalize(self, data):
        # Example normalization
        return (data - data.min()) / (data.max() - data.min())

class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, initial_model):
        self.model = initial_model

    def train(self, data, labels):
        # Train model (replace with appropriate ML library, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
        self.model.fit(data, labels)

    def evaluate(self, data, labels):
        # Evaluate model
        predictions = self.model.predict(data)
        accuracy = np.mean(predictions == labels)
        return accuracy

    def recursive_improvement(self, data, labels):
        current_accuracy = self.evaluate(data, labels)
        iterations = 0
        # Recursive strategy for self-improvement
        while True:
            self.train(data, labels)
            new_accuracy = self.evaluate(data, labels)
            if new_accuracy <= current_accuracy:
                break
            current_accuracy = new_accuracy
            iterations += 1
            print(f"Iteration {iterations}: Improved accuracy to {new_accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

class AutonomousSystem:
    def __init__(self, data_source, initial_model):
        self.data_pipeline = DataPipeline(data_source)
        self.recursive_learner = RecursiveLearner(initial_model)

    def run(self):
        # Main loop for running the autonomous system
        raw_data = self.data_pipeline.extract()
        transformed_data = self.data_pipeline.transform(raw_data)
        labels = transformed_data['label']  # Assume 'label' is the column for supervised learning
        features = transformed_data.drop(columns='label')

        self.recursive_learner.recursive_improvement(features, labels)

    def monitor_and_feedback(self):
        # Monitoring system performance and feedback mechanism
        performance_metrics = self.evaluate_system()
        self.recursive_learner.recursive_improvement(performance_metrics['features'], performance_metrics['labels'])

    def evaluate_system(self):
        # Sample logic to obtain ground truth and model features
        ground_truth = pd.read_csv('ground_truth.csv')
        features = ground_truth.drop(columns='label')
        
        return {'features': features, 'labels': ground_truth['label']}


# Example Usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Dummy initial model (should be replaced with a real ML model)
    class DummyModel:
        def fit(self, X, y): pass
        def predict(self, X): return np.random.choice(y, size=len(X))
    
    data_source = 'data.csv'
    initial_model = DummyModel()

    autonomous_system = AutonomousSystem(data_source, initial_model)
    autonomous_system.run()
    autonomous_system.monitor_and_feedback()
```

### Key Elements Explained:

1. **Data Pipeline**: Responsible for data extraction from a specified source, transformation (normalization, feature engineering, etc.), and loading of the processed data.

2. **Recursive Learner**: Contains the recursive learning strategy to iteratively train the model. It re-trains the model until the established criteria for accuracy improvements are no longer met.

3. **Autonomous System**: The main class responsible for running the recursive learning loop and integrating monitoring and feedback mechanisms.

4. **Monitoring and Feedback**: A system evaluates performance and feeds back results to the `RecursiveLearner` to adjust and improve the models further over time.

Remember, this code is a basic template to conceptualize the architecture. For a real development scenario, you would integrate advanced machine learning techniques and appropriate libraries for model training, monitoring, and evaluation.
