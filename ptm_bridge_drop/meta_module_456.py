Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical company or entity) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves leveraging modern AI and machine learning techniques. Innovative recursive strategies could involve recursive neural networks, recursive feature elimination, and more. Below, Iâ€™ll outline a high-level design for such a module and provide a basic implementation example.

### High-Level Design

1. **Core Concept:**
   - Develop self-improving models that utilize recursive strategies for optimizing and evolving their performance over time.
   - Implement feedback loops to iteratively improve model performance using new data and past performance metrics.

2. **Components:**

   - **Data Processor:**
     - Preprocess and clean incoming data.
     - Implement feature engineering and recursive feature elimination.

   - **Model Trainer:**
     - Use recursive neural networks (RNNs) or other recursive algorithms for training.
     - Implement meta-learning strategies where models evolve by learning from previous versions (model iteration).

   - **Performance Evaluator:**
     - Analyze model performance and log metrics.
     - Identify areas for improvement and guide the recursive learning process.

   - **Auto-Optimizer:**
     - Use hyperparameter optimization techniques to fine-tune models.
     - Implement techniques like genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning to evolve model parameters and architectures.

3. **Recursive Strategies:**
   - Recursive Model Updates: Continuously update the model with new data to improve accuracy.
   - Feedback Loops: Regularly incorporate performance feedback to refine models.
   - Adaptive Learning Rates: Modify learning rates in a recursive manner based on observed learning patterns.

4. **Technology Stack:**
   - Python libraries: TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning, Pandas and NumPy for data handling, Scikit-learn for basic ML tasks.
   - Advanced libraries: Ray for distributed computing, Optuna or Hyperopt for hyperparameter optimization.
  
### Basic Implementation Example

Below is a basic outline implementing some of these ideas. Note that this is a simplified version for illustration.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE

class SelfEvolvingModel:
    def __init__(self, data, target):
        self.data = data
        self.target = target
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier()
        self.history = []

    def preprocess_data(self):
        # Recursive feature elimination
        rfe = RFE(self.model, n_features_to_select=5)
        self.data = rfe.fit_transform(self.data, self.target)

    def train_model(self):
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
            self.data, self.target, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
        
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions = self.model.predict(X_test)
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
        print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")
        self.history.append(accuracy)

    def recursive_train(self, iterations=10):
        for i in range(iterations):
            print(f"Iteration {i+1}")
            self.train_model()
            # Hypothetical function to incorporate new data
            self.update_data()

    def update_data(self):
        # Simulation for data update, e.g., load new batch of data from a data source
        new_data_batch = np.random.rand(100, self.data.shape[1])  # Random data example
        new_target_batch = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
        self.data = np.vstack([self.data, new_data_batch])
        self.target = np.hstack([self.target, new_target_batch])
        self.preprocess_data()

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Assuming a dataset with 100 samples and 10 features
    data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    target = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
    
    evolving_model = SelfEvolvingModel(data, target)
    evolving_model.preprocess_data()
    evolving_model.recursive_train()
```

### Explanation:
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):** Used to recursively select important features.
- **Model Training and Iteration:** The model is iteratively trained, and data is updated theoretically to simulate incoming data for continuous learning.
- **Feedback Loop:** Accuracy is logged and printed to show performance trends over iterations.

This structure is intended as a blueprint. You would need to flesh it out with your specific requirements and potentially integrate it with bigger data ecosystems and hardware resources to realize a fully functioning autonomous stack.
