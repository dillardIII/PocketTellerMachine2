Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably Post-Turing Machine or any specific entity you're targeting) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves a balance of designing core functionalities and facilitating adaptable, machine-driven evolution over time. Here's a conceptual framework to structure this module:

### Key Concepts

1. **Recursive Learning**: The module should facilitate recursive learning processes, enabling autonomous components to improve iteratively through repetition and feedback.
   
2. **Adaptability and Scalability**: Each component should be designed to adapt and function independently at scale, allowing the entire system to grow and evolve without manual interference.

3. **Communication and Coordination**: Components must seamlessly interact to maintain coherence across the stack, utilizing predefined protocols for synchronization.

4. **Innovative Algorithms**: Employ the latest in algorithmic development for decision-making and adaptation, particularly recursive methods like Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Algorithms, or Recursive Neural Networks.

### Module Design

```python
# Filename: ptm_self_evolution.py

import logging
import random
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Any, List

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

class Strategy(ABC):
    """An abstract base strategy that defines various recursive learning and execution methods."""
    
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, data: Any) -> Any:
        """Execute the strategy using recursive decision-making or learning."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def adapt(self):
        """Adapt the strategy based on feedback received from previous operations."""
        pass

class RecursiveLearner(Strategy):
    """A recursive learner implementing an evolutionary approach."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.generation = 0
        self.history = []
        
    def execute(self, data: Any) -> Any:
        decision = self._make_decision(data)
        self.history.append(decision)
        logging.debug(f"Generation {self.generation}: Executed with decision: {decision}")
        self.adapt()
        return decision
        
    def _make_decision(self, data: Any) -> Any:
        # Some decision-making logic based on current state and data
        return { 'action': random.choice(['expand', 'consolidate', 'innovate']), 'confidence': random.random() }
    
    def adapt(self):
        # Adapt the planning strategy using historical data
        feedback = self._evaluate_performance()
        if feedback:
            # Evolve strategy with recursive feedback and evolution logic
            logging.debug(f"Adapting strategy based on feedback: {feedback}")
            self.history = self.history[-50:]  # Preserve memory efficiency by keeping recent actions only
        self.generation += 1
    
    def _evaluate_performance(self) -> Any:
        # Evaluate past decisions and return feedback for improvements
        return not self.history or random.choice([True, False])  # Random simulation of performance results

class CoordinationManager:
    """A manager for handling coordination between strategies and tracking the overall system state."""
    
    def __init__(self, strategies: List[Strategy]):
        self.strategies = strategies
    
    def run(self, data_stream: List[Any]):
        for data in data_stream:
            logging.debug(f"Processing data: {data}")
            for strategy in self.strategies:
                strategy.execute(data)

# Example usage of the module
if __name__ == '__main__':
    strategies = [RecursiveLearner() for _ in range(3)]  # Create multiple learners to simulate diversity
    manager = CoordinationManager(strategies)
    # Simulating data stream over time for continuous learning
    data_stream = ['data1', 'data2', 'data3', 'data4', 'data5']
    manager.run(data_stream)
```

### Explanation

- **Strategy Pattern**: The `Strategy` abstract base class provides the structure for various recursive learning approaches. Each implemented strategy can be independently developed and tested.

- **RecursiveLearner**: Implements recursive improvement through a simulated learning cycle, adapting based on the feedback loop which evaluates past decisions.

- **CoordinationManager**: Manages multiple instances of strategies, simulating collaboration and ensuring consistent execution across the system.

- **Logging**: Throughout the module, logging captures strategic actions and adaptations.

This framework provides a flexible base for expanding autonomy systems using recursive strategies. Individual components can be further tailored and honed to suit specific domain requirements, integrating more sophisticated AI/ML approaches as necessary.
