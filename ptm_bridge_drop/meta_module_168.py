Designing a Python module to expand the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies requires careful planning and consideration of various system aspects. Below is a conceptual design that outlines the main components and strategies that could be implemented within this module.

```python
# ptm_autonomy_stack.py

import random
import logging
from collections import defaultdict

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)


class SelfEvolvingModule:
    def __init__(self, initial_state=None):
        """
        Initialize the Self-Evolving Module with an initial state.
        """
        self.state = initial_state if initial_state is not None else {}
        self.history = []  # To track state changes over time
        self.behavior_registry = defaultdict(list)

    def register_behavior(self, trigger, behavior):
        """
        Register a new behavior for a specific trigger.
        :param trigger: Condition to be met for the behavior.
        :param behavior: Function to execute when triggered.
        """
        self.behavior_registry[trigger].append(behavior)

    def evolve(self):
        """
        Main evolution logic. Recursively adapt based on current state.
        """
        for trigger, behaviors in self.behavior_registry.items():
            if trigger(self.state):
                for behavior in behaviors:
                    self.state = behavior(self.state)  # Apply behavior
                    self.history.append(self.state)

        # Recursive innovation: modify trigger-conditions and behaviors
        self.innovate()

    def innovate(self):
        """
        Systematic self-reconfiguration. Modify behaviors or add new ones.
        """
        if random.random() > 0.5:
            # Alter an existing behavior
            trigger_to_modify = random.choice(list(self.behavior_registry.keys()))
            if self.behavior_registry[trigger_to_modify]:
                behavior_to_change = random.choice(self.behavior_registry[trigger_to_modify])
                modified_behavior = lambda state: behavior_to_change({**state, "innovation": True})
                self.behavior_registry[trigger_to_modify].append(modified_behavior)
                logging.info("Behavior modified with an innovation trigger.")

        else:
            # Add a new behavior
            new_trigger = lambda state: "innovation" in state
            new_behavior = lambda state: {**state, "new_feature": "active"}
            self.register_behavior(new_trigger, new_behavior)
            logging.info("New behavior added due to innovation.")

    def execute(self):
        """
        Execute the self-evolution process.
        """
        logging.info("Starting self-evolving process.")
        self.evolve()
        logging.info("Evolution complete.")


# Example behaviors
def basic_behavior(state):
    state['counter'] = state.get('counter', 0) + 1
    return state


def conditional_behavior(state):
    if state.get('counter', 0) > 5:
        state['status'] = 'active'
    return state


# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    module = SelfEvolvingModule(initial_state={"counter": 0})

    # Registering some behaviors
    module.register_behavior(lambda state: True, basic_behavior)
    module.register_behavior(lambda state: state.get('counter', 0) > 3, conditional_behavior)

    module.execute()

    # Inspect results
    logging.info(f"Final state: {module.state}")
    logging.info(f"State history: {module.history}")
```

### Key Concepts Explained:

1. **Self-Evolution and Recursion**: The module evolves by iteratively (and recursively) applying behaviors based on triggers. This self-reconfiguration allows for adaptive system behavior changes.

2. **Behavior Registration and Trigger System**: Behaviors are registered with specific triggers that dictate under what conditions they are activated. This modular design helps in dynamically expanding capabilities.

3. **Innovation Strategy**: This component allows the module to create new behaviors or modify existing ones, introducing the concept of innovation within the recursive loop.

4. **State Management and History Tracking**: The system tracks its state and maintains a history of changes, allowing for analysis and potential rollback capabilities.

5. **Logging for Monitoring**: The module includes logging to monitor its progress and transformations, which is essential for understanding the recursive innovations and debugging purposes.

This design represents a flexible, self-evolving system that can dynamically adapt and modify its own behavior. Further enhancements could focus on integrating more advanced machine learning models or decision-making processes for more sophisticated autonomy. Adjust the complexity and heuristics of the recursive strategies according to specific requirements and resource availability.
