Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably an autonomous technology company) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves incorporating advanced recursive strategies that would enhance their autonomous systems in terms of adaptability, learning efficiency, and decision-making. Below is a conceptual design of such a module, focusing on recursive strategies, modularity, and scalability.

### Module Overview

This module, named `AutonomyEnhancer`, is built to integrate seamlessly into PTM's current systems and enhance their autonomy stack's learning and adaptability through recursive deep learning techniques, self-corrective feedback loops, and modular integration.

### Key Features

1. **Recursive Learning Module (RLM):**
    - Implements recursive neural networks that allow for adaptive learning by revisiting previous layers with updated weights.
    - Uses historical data to refine decision-making processes through reinforcement learning enhanced with recursive strategies.
  
2. **Self-Corrective Feedback System (SCFS):**
    - Incorporates real-time performance monitoring.
    - Adjusts system parameters dynamically based on recursive analysis of operational data.
    - Utilizes Bayesian optimization to iteratively refine the models.
  
3. **Modular Plugin Architecture:**
    - Supports the integration of domain-specific plugins, which can be developed independently and plugged into the system without modifying the core code.
    - Encourages community contribution to develop and share plugins for various autonomous tasks.
  
4. **Advanced Simulation Suite:**
    - Provides a recursive approach to simulation, where outcomes feed back into the system to progressively improve model accuracy through synthetic data generation.
    - Integrates with real-world testing data for rigorously evaluated synthetic simulations.
  
5. **Cognitive Loop Architecture (CLA):**
    - Mimics cognitive processes using recursive loops that continuously refine perception, decision, and action layers.
    - Supports unsupervised and semi-supervised learning to enhance adaptability to new environments.

### Conceptual Code Structure

```python
# autonomy_enhancer.py

from typing import Any, Callable, Tuple, List
import numpy as np

class RecursiveLearningModule:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize any recursive model parameters here
        pass

    def recursive_learn(self, data: np.ndarray, iterations: int = 10):
        """Perform recursive learning on data."""
        for _ in range(iterations):
            # Here, implement a recursive learning strategy
            self._update_model(data)
    
    def _update_model(self, data: np.ndarray):
        # Logic to recursively update the model based on new data
        pass

class SelfCorrectiveFeedbackSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize feedback system parameters
        pass

    def monitor_and_correct(self, system_state: Any):
        """Continuously monitor and adjust system parameters."""
        # Logic for dynamic adjustment based on recursive feedback analysis
        self._adjust_parameters(system_state)
    
    def _adjust_parameters(self, state: Any):
        # Update logical implementations for corrective action
        pass

class ModularityManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.plugins = []

    def load_plugin(self, plugin: Callable):
        """Load an external plugin into the system."""
        self.plugins.append(plugin)

    def execute_plugins(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """Execute loaded plugins sequentially."""
        for plugin in self.plugins:
            plugin(*args, **kwargs)

class AdvancedSimulationSuite:
    def simulate(self, scenario: Any):
        """Recursively simulate scenarios to refine models."""
        # Implement complex recursive simulations integrating new data
        pass

class AutonomyEnhancer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.recursive_module = RecursiveLearningModule()
        self.feedback_system = SelfCorrectiveFeedbackSystem()
        self.modularity_manager = ModularityManager()
        self.simulation_suite = AdvancedSimulationSuite()

    def enhance_system(self):
        """Enhance the autonomy stack using the incorporated modules."""
        # Orchestrate recursive learning and self-correction
        pass

# Usage example
enhancer = AutonomyEnhancer()
enhancer.enhance_system()
```

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Integration Testing:** Ensure each component integrates seamlessly into existing stacks and performs under expected conditions.
2. **Continuous Learning Pipeline:** Establish a CI/CD inspired learning pipeline to enable continuous improvement and deployment of autonomous capabilities.
3. **Stakeholder Feedback Loop:** Incorporate feedback from operational teams and stakeholders to iteratively refine the stack.

### Conclusion

Incorporating recursive strategies and a modular design, the `AutonomyEnhancer` module aims to significantly boost PTM's autonomous systems' capability, adaptability, and operational efficiency. Iterative development and deployment will ensure the module remains relevant and cutting-edge.
