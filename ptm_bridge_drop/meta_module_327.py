Designing a Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably, a fictional entity) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies can be approached by breaking down the problem into a few key components. The goal is to create a module that can autonomously expand and improve its functionalities through recursive techniques. I will describe a high-level design and then provide a skeleton code example.

### High-Level Design

1. **Self-Improving Knowledge Base**: Use a decentralized knowledge graph to store and evolve relations and rules that dictate PTM's actions. This knowledge base can be dynamically updated by recursive algorithms.

2. **Recursive Learning Algorithms**: Implement algorithms that can recursively improve their performance. Use techniques such as reinforcement learning with recursive state evaluation or neural network self-training.

3. **Adaptive Reasoning Engine**: Develop a reasoning engine capable of recursively refining its reasoning paths, leveraging the knowledge base for decision-making.

4. **Automated Module Generation**: Create a meta-programming environment where the module can autonomously generate new sub-modules to handle novel tasks, similar to genetic programming.

5. **Continuous Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback loop to analyze the performance of recursive strategies and knowledge updates, allowing the system to self-optimize over time.

### Key Components in the Module

- **KnowledgeGraph**: Handles the storage and update of knowledge relationships.
- **RecursiveLearner**: Implements reinforcement learning and recursive strategies to self-improve.
- **ReasoningEngine**: Evaluates decisions and dynamically updates decision-making processes.
- **ModuleGenerator**: Automates the creation of new functionalities based on existing ones.
- **FeedbackAnalyzer**: Provides performance metrics and corrections to improve learning and reasoning.

### Python Skeleton Code

```python
class KnowledgeGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = {}

    def add_relation(self, node1, relation, node2):
        # Add a relationship and store it
        pass

    def update_knowledge(self, data):
        # Recursive function to evolve the knowledge graph
        pass

class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_graph):
        self.knowledge_graph = knowledge_graph

    def train(self, environment):
        # Implement recursive learning algorithms
        pass

class ReasoningEngine:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_graph):
        self.knowledge_graph = knowledge_graph

    def evaluate(self, situation):
        # Recursive reasoning based on the knowledge graph
        pass

class ModuleGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.generated_modules = []

    def create_module(self, description):
        # Meta-programming to generate new functionality
        pass

class FeedbackAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, learner, reasoning_engine):
        self.learner = learner
        self.reasoning_engine = reasoning_engine

    def analyze_performance(self):
        # Analyze the effectiveness of learning and reasoning
        pass

class SelfEvolvingAutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_graph = KnowledgeGraph()
        self.learner = RecursiveLearner(self.knowledge_graph)
        self.reasoning_engine = ReasoningEngine(self.knowledge_graph)
        self.module_generator = ModuleGenerator()
        self.feedback_analyzer = FeedbackAnalyzer(self.learner, self.reasoning_engine)

    def evolve(self):
        # Main loop to run the autonomous evolution process
        # Recursively improve the autonomy stack
        pass

# Example usage
autonomy_stack = SelfEvolvingAutonomyStack()
autonomy_stack.evolve()
```

### Considerations

- **Scalability**: The module should be scalable to handle an increasing number of relationships and decisions as it evolves.
- **Security**: Ensure that dynamic updates and module generation do not introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Implement safeguards for ethical decision-making and alignment with human values.

This skeleton provides a starting point. Real implementation would involve extensive development, especially in recursive learning algorithms and dynamic knowledge graph updates based on the application's specific needs.
