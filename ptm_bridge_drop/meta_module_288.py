Designing a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably a fictional or conceptual organization) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves incorporating recursive strategies, machine learning, and possibly autonomous decision-making mechanisms. Here's a conceptual overview and code example of how you might structure such a module:

### Concept and Strategy

1. **Recursive Strategies**: Use recursion to implement strategies that can adapt over time, such as recursive reinforcement learning or self-modifying code.

2. **Self-evolving Mechanisms**: Integrate self-improving algorithms like genetic algorithms or evolutionary strategies to allow the module to evolve solutions over iterations.

3. **Autonomy and Decision Making**: Implement decision trees or neural networks to give the module the capacity for autonomous decision-making.

4. **Data Collection and Feedback Loops**: Continuously collect data to update and refine the model, using feedback loops for improvement.

### Module Structure

```python
import random
import numpy as np

class AutonomousEntity:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize with a default strategy
        self.strategy = self.default_strategy
        self.generation = 0
        self.performance_metric = []

    def default_strategy(self, input_data):
        """
        A basic decision-making strategy.
        """
        # Implement a simple strategy as a placeholder
        return sum(input_data) % 2  # Simple heuristic for decision making

    def evaluate_performance(self, decision, outcome):
        """
        Evaluate how good a decision was.
        """
        # Simple example: if decision matches the outcome, it's a success
        return decision == outcome

    def recursive_improve(self, input_data, outcome):
        """
        A recursive method to enhance the strategy.
        """
        decision = self.strategy(input_data)
        success = self.evaluate_performance(decision, outcome)
        self.performance_metric.append(success)

        if not success:
            # If failure, evolve strategy
            self.evolve_strategy()
            # Try again with the new strategy
            self.recursive_improve(input_data, outcome)

    def evolve_strategy(self):
        """
        Generate a new strategy based on performance.
        """
        self.generation += 1
        success_rate = sum(self.performance_metric) / len(self.performance_metric)
        print(f"Evolving strategy... Generation: {self.generation} | Success Rate: {success_rate:.2f}")

        # Example evolution: Mutating decision-making logic
        def new_strategy(input_data):
            # Simple evolution: change the decision-making heuristic
            return (sum(input_data) + random.choice([-1, 0, 1])) % 2

        # Set this new strategy
        self.strategy = new_strategy

    def run(self, data_stream):
        """
        Process a continuous data stream and make decisions.
        """
        for data_point, actual_outcome in data_stream:
            self.recursive_improve(data_point, actual_outcome)
            print("Current Strategy Performance:", self.performance_metric)

# Usage example
data_stream = [([1, 2, 3], 0), ([4, 0, 1], 1), ([2, 3, 1], 0)]  # (input_data, expected outcome)
autonomous_system = AutonomousEntity()
autonomous_system.run(data_stream)
```

### Key Features

- **Recursive Improvement**: The `recursive_improve` method recursively adjusts the strategy until success is achieved, learning from feedback.
  
- **Strategy Evolution**: A simple but innovative strategy evolution logic that mutates the decision-making process based on performance metrics.

- **Autonomous Running**: The `run` method processes a stream of data, simulating continuous operation and decision-making.

This module represents a foundational framework for an autonomous system that can recursively and autonomously evolve its decision-making capabilities over time, potentially useful in various domains such as automated trading, robotic control, or adaptive systems. Expand and refine the strategies, decision heuristics, and evolution mechanisms to fit specific applications or environments.
