Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably Predictive Technology Model) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating machine learning, recursive algorithms, and potentially self-improving mechanisms. Hereâ€™s a high-level design plan for your module, which we'll call `AutoExpansion`.

### Module Overview

The `AutoExpansion` module aims to enhance the PTM's capabilities by introducing a self-evolving strategy that leverages recursive learning and adaptation techniques. Key features will include automated model improvement, environment interaction, feedback assimilation, and strategic architecture evolution.

### Key Components

1. **Data Acquisition Layer**

   - **Environment Interface**: Collects data from the environment, which can be real-world or simulated.
   - **Preprocessing Unit**: Normalizes and preprocesses incoming data for further analysis.

2. **Recursive Strategy Engine**

   - **Model Evolution Manager**: Uses recursive learning strategies to iterate and evolve models based on performance metrics.
   - **Strategy Generator**: Develops and tests new strategies recursively for autonomous tasks.

3. **Learning and Adaptation Core**

   - **Reinforcement Learning Agent**: Employs advanced RL techniques that learn from interacting with the environment.
   - **Meta-Learning Processor**: Enhances model adaptability by learning to learn, refining strategies with each iteration.

4. **Feedback Integration System**

   - **Performance Evaluator**: Monitors model performance continuously using KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).
   - **Adaptation Trigger**: Decides when the system needs to evolve; triggers the Strategy Engine based on performance feedback.

5. **Output and Deployment Interface**

   - **Autonomy Executor**: Implements optimal strategies in real-world scenarios.
   - **Result Dispatcher**: Sends results and data to other PTM modules for further processing or decision-making.

### Key Innovative Recursive Strategies

1. **Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Implement advanced versions of RNNs that can process sequences and recursive data structures, adapting their weights autonomously over time.

2. **Nested Learning Loops**: Set up loops within loops for training. For example, while the main loop focuses on strategy improvement, inner loops can enhance specific task functionalities.

3. **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)**: Break down tasks into sub-tasks recursively, where each level improves based on its specific feedback before contributing to the parent task improvements.

4. **Self-modifying Code**: Incorporate code structures that partially rewrite themselves based on the output and conditions observed through environment interactions.

5. **Evolvable Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Use recursive GANs to generate synthetic data to simulate various scenarios and improve strategy robustness.

### Code Structure

Here is a rough outline of how the code structure might look:

```python
# auto_expansion/__init__.py

class AutoExpansion:
    def __init__(self, environment):
        self.environment = environment
        self.data_layer = DataAcquisitionLayer()
        self.strategy_engine = RecursiveStrategyEngine()
        self.adaptation_core = LearningAndAdaptationCore()
        self.feedback_system = FeedbackIntegrationSystem()

    def initialize(self):
        self.data_layer.setup(self.environment)

    def evolve(self):
        while True:
            data = self.data_layer.collect_data()
            self.adaptation_core.process(data)
            feedback = self.feedback_system.evaluate()
            if self.feedback_system.adaptation_needed(feedback):
                self.strategy_engine.evolve_model()

    def deploy(self):
        pass  # Implement deployment strategy

# Each component would have its file, e.g., auto_expansion/data_layer.py
```

### Considerations

- **Scalability**: Ensure that the module can handle both small scale and large scale data efficiently.
- **Interoperability**: Make sure the module integrates well with existing PTM systems.
- **Security**: Implement protocols to secure data and model access.
- **Ethics**: Consider ethical implications of autonomous decision-making and data usage.

This modular design allows for flexibility, future expandability, and integration of cutting-edge machine learning techniques, fundamentally enhancing the PTM empire's autonomy stack.
