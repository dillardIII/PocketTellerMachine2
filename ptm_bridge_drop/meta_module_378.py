Creating a Python module to expand the PTM (presumably a fictional organization in your query) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack can involve numerous advanced and innovative strategies. This includes developing an ecosystem that can adapt and evolve over time using recursive strategies—self-improvement algorithms that build upon previous iterations. Below is a basic outline and some ideas for implementing such a module:

### Module: `ptm_evolving_stack`

#### Core Concepts
1. **Recursive Learning**: Implement machine learning models that iteratively improve by learning from previous generations.
2. **Genetic Algorithms**: Use genetic algorithms to optimize solutions by mimicking natural evolution.
3. **Automated Model Tuning**: Develop strategies for automated hyperparameter tuning and model selection.
4. **Knowledge Distillation**: Employ techniques for transferring knowledge from larger, complex models to smaller, efficient ones.
5. **Continual Learning**: Ensure models can learn continuously from new data without catastrophic forgetting.
6. **Multi-agent Collaboration**: Design systems where multiple agents collaborate, learn from each other, and adapt to changes collectively.

### Implementation Outline

#### `__init__.py`

```python
# File: ptm_evolving_stack/__init__.py

from .recursive_learner import RecursiveLearner
from .genetic_optimizer import GeneticOptimizer
from .model_tuner import AutoModelTuner
from .knowledge_distiller import KnowledgeDistiller
from .continual_learner import ContinualLearner
from .multi_agent_system import MultiAgentSystem
```

#### Recursive Learning Module

```python
# File: ptm_evolving_stack/recursive_learner.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, RegressorMixin
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

class RecursiveLearner(BaseEstimator, RegressorMixin):
    def __init__(self, base_model, iterations=10):
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.iterations = iterations
        self.models = []

    def fit(self, X, y):
        X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
        current_model = self.base_model
        best_accuracy = 0
        
        for i in range(self.iterations):
            current_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
            predictions = current_model.predict(X_val)
            accuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, predictions)
            if accuracy > best_accuracy:
                best_accuracy = accuracy
                self.models.append(current_model)

        return self

    def predict(self, X):
        ensemble_predictions = np.mean([model.predict(X) for model in self.models], axis=0)
        return np.round(ensemble_predictions)
```

#### Genetic Optimization Module

```python
# File: ptm_evolving_stack/genetic_optimizer.py

class GeneticOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, population_size, generations, mutation_rate):
        self.population_size = population_size
        self.generations = generations
        self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate
    
    def optimize(self, fitness_function):
        # Implement genetic algorithm logic here
        pass
```

#### Automated Model Tuning

```python
# File: ptm_evolving_stack/model_tuner.py

class AutoModelTuner:
    def __init__(self, model, param_grid):
        self.model = model
        self.param_grid = param_grid
    
    def tune(self, X, y):
        # Implement grid search or randomized search
        pass
```

#### Knowledge Distillation

```python
# File: ptm_evolving_stack/knowledge_distiller.py

class KnowledgeDistiller:
    def __init__(self, teacher_model, student_model):
        self.teacher = teacher_model
        self.student = student_model

    def distill(self, X, y):
        # Implement distillation logic to transfer knowledge
        pass
```

#### Continual Learning

```python
# File: ptm_evolving_stack/continual_learner.py

class ContinualLearner:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model

    def update(self, new_data):
        # Implement continual learning procedures here
        pass
```

#### Multi-Agent Systems

```python
# File: ptm_evolving_stack/multi_agent_system.py

class MultiAgentSystem:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        self.agents = agents

    def collaborate(self):
        # Implement collaboration between agents
        pass
```

### Usage Example

```python
from ptm_evolving_stack import RecursiveLearner, GeneticOptimizer

# Define your initial model
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

base_model = LinearRegression()

# Create a recursive learner
recursive_learner = RecursiveLearner(base_model)
recursive_learner.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = recursive_learner.predict(X_test)
```

This is just a basic framework, and further development would be necessary for a fully operational module. The module could be extended with hyperparameter optimization, advanced neural networks, integration with futures markets, etc. Always ensure appropriate documentation, testing, and validation during real-world development.
