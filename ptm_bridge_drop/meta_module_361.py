Designing a new Python module for expanding the PTM (Potentially Tactical Machine) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack is a complex task that requires a strategic approach to incorporate innovative recursive strategies. Below is a high-level design outline along with a sample implementation focusing on key components:

### Module: `recursive_autonomy`

#### Overview
The `recursive_autonomy` module is designed to enhance the PTM empire's ability to self-evolve by incorporating recursive strategies for decision-making, learning, and adaptation. The module consists of interconnected components that work together to assess situations, make decisions, and learn from outcomes to improve performance over time.

#### Key Components

1. **Situation Assessment (`situation_assessment.py`)**:
    - Continuously monitors environmental inputs and internal states.
    - Uses recursive data processing techniques to identify patterns and anomalies.
    - Outputs a situational context that is fed into the decision-making process.

2. **Decision-Making (`decision_engine.py`)**:
    - Implements a recursive decision tree structure.
    - Employs strategy evaluation using a reinforcement learning framework.
    - Adapts decisions based on feedback loops from previous actions and outcomes.

3. **Learning & Adaptation (`learning_adaptation.py`)**:
    - Recursive neural network (RNN) based learning system.
    - Updates its knowledge base by recursively analyzing results from the decision engine.
    - Leverages meta-learning approaches to hyper-evolve strategies across scenarios.

4. **Feedback Mechanism (`feedback_loop.py`)**:
    - Collects performance metrics and environmental feedback.
    - Recursively adjusts parameters and improves decision accuracy through reinforcement signals.

5. **Integration and Coordination (`integration_controller.py`)**:
    - Manages the execution flow and ensures the harmony between components.
    - Utilizes a strategy orchestrator that aligns with PTM's mission objectives.

#### Sample Implementation

Here is a basic implementation framework illustrating how these components might be defined:

```python
# situation_assessment.py
class SituationAssessment:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def assess_environment(self, data):
        # Implement recursive pattern recognition
        context = self._recursive_analysis(data)
        return context

    def _recursive_analysis(self, data):
        # Analyze data recursively
        # ... (implementation details)
        return "context"

# decision_engine.py
class DecisionEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def make_decision(self, context):
        # Use a recursive decision-making process
        decision = self._recursive_decision_tree(context)
        return decision

    def _recursive_decision_tree(self, context):
        # ... (implementation details)
        return "decision"

# learning_adaptation.py
class LearningAdaptation:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def learn_and_adapt(self, decision, outcome):
        # Implement recursive learning strategies
        self._update_knowledge_base(decision, outcome)

    def _update_knowledge_base(self, decision, outcome):
        # Recursive knowledge updating
        # ... (implementation details)
        pass

# feedback_loop.py
class FeedbackLoop:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def feedback(self, decision, outcome):
        # Provide feedback for adaptation
        # ... (implementation details)
        pass

# integration_controller.py
class IntegrationController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.situation_assessment = SituationAssessment()
        self.decision_engine = DecisionEngine()
        self.learning_adaptation = LearningAdaptation()
        self.feedback_loop = FeedbackLoop()

    def run(self, data):
        context = self.situation_assessment.assess_environment(data)
        decision = self.decision_engine.make_decision(context)
        outcome = self.execute_decision(decision)
        self.feedback_loop.feedback(decision, outcome)
        self.learning_adaptation.learn_and_adapt(decision, outcome)

    def execute_decision(self, decision):
        # Simulate decision execution
        # ... (executing and getting outcome)
        return "outcome"

# Usage Example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    integration_controller = IntegrationController()
    integration_controller.run(data="initial data")
```

### Conclusion
The `recursive_autonomy` module is designed to create an adaptive, self-evolving system capable of strategically navigating complex environments. By using recursive strategies, it ensures that the PTM empire remains agile and responsive to changing conditions, ultimately enhancing its autonomous capabilities. As always, additional features, optimizations, and rigorous testing would be necessary in a real-world implementation.
