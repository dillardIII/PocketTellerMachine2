Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves multiple steps and components. Below is a high-level outline of the module's construction, focusing on recursive strategies and self-evolution mechanisms. The design will emphasize modularity, flexibility, and the ability to learn and adapt.

### Module Overview

The module, named `AutonomyStack`, will consist of several key components:

1. **Data Acquisition and Processing**
2. **Recursive Learning System**
3. **Autonomous Decision-Making**
4. **Adaptation and Evolution Mechanism**
5. **Integration and Communication Interface**

### 1. Data Acquisition and Processing

The data acquisition component will handle the ingestion of various types of input data. This module should be capable of integrating with various data sources, both streaming, and batch.

```python
class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self, data_source):
        self.data_source = data_source
    
    def fetch_data(self):
        # Implementation for data fetching
        pass
    
    def preprocess_data(self, data):
        # Implement basic cleaning, normalization, etc.
        return processed_data
```

### 2. Recursive Learning System

The core of the module will leverage recursive algorithms that iteratively refine their understanding and performance using the data available. Techniques such as Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) or other recursive structures can be utilized.

```python
class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize model parameters
        pass
    
    def train(self, data):
        # Recursive training algorithm implementation
        for recursion in range(RECURSION_DEPTH):
            self._recursive_step(data)
    
    def _recursive_step(self, data):
        # Method for single recursion step
        pass
```

### 3. Autonomous Decision-Making

This component will focus on interpreting the outputs of the recursive learner and making autonomous decisions.

```python
class DecisionMaker:
    def __init__(self, recursive_learner):
        self.recursive_learner = recursive_learner
    
    def make_decision(self, data):
        # Utilize recursive learner's output to make informed decisions
        decision = self.recursive_learner.predict(data)
        # Apply logic for autonomous operation
        return decision
```

### 4. Adaptation and Evolution Mechanism

A self-evolving module must adapt to new insights and changes over time. This will involve dynamically updating models and decision-making logic based on performance feedback and new data.

```python
class EvolutionHandler:
    def __init__(self, learner, decision_maker):
        self.learner = learner
        self.decision_maker = decision_maker
    
    def adapt(self, feedback):
        # Adaptation logic using feedback
        self._evolve_learner(feedback)
        self._evolve_decision_maker(feedback)
    
    def _evolve_learner(self, feedback):
        # Logic to evolve the learning mechanism
        pass
    
    def _evolve_decision_maker(self, feedback):
        # Logic to evolve the decision making
        pass
```

### 5. Integration and Communication Interface

This component serves as the communication layer with other systems, ensuring the module functions cohesively with the existing PTM infrastructure.

```python
class IntegrationModule:
    def __init__(self):
        # Setup communication pipelines
        pass
    
    def send_data(self, data):
        # Send data to other systems
        pass
    
    def receive_data(self):
        # Logic for receiving data from other systems
        return data
```

### Concluding Integration

Bringing all these components together involves initializing and connecting each part to form a cohesive system:

```python
class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self, data_source):
        self.data_processor = DataProcessor(data_source)
        self.learner = RecursiveLearner()
        self.decision_maker = DecisionMaker(self.learner)
        self.evolution_handler = EvolutionHandler(self.learner, self.decision_maker)
        self.integration_module = IntegrationModule()
    
    def operate(self):
        data = self.data_processor.fetch_data()
        processed_data = self.data_processor.preprocess_data(data)
        self.learner.train(processed_data)
        decision = self.decision_maker.make_decision(processed_data)
        feedback = self.integration_module.send_data(decision)
        self.evolution_handler.adapt(feedback)
```

### Additional Notes

- **Scalability**: Ensure each component of the module is designed to scale with increasing data volumes and complexity.
- **Modularity**: Maintain a clear separation of concerns, with each class responsible for a specific aspect of the autonomy stack.
- **Extensibility**: Design the system to accommodate future enhancements, such as new learning algorithms or decision frameworks.

This module serves as a foundational blueprint for developing an advanced autonomy stack capable of self-evolution and adaptation critical for expanding the PTM empire's capabilities.
