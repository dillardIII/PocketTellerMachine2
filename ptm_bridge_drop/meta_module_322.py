Creating an innovative Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably meaning "Partially Trained Model" or another term if this is a fictional empire) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves a blend of advanced AI techniques, recursive strategies, and modular design. Here's a high-level conceptual design for such a module.

### Module Overview: `ptm_autonomy_stack`

The `ptm_autonomy_stack` is a Python module designed to enhance the self-evolving capabilities of the PTM empire's autonomy stack. It features recursive learning, self-optimization, and adaptive decision-making strategies.

#### Key Features:

1. **Recursive Learning Framework**:
   - Implements a feedback loop for continuous learning and improvement.
   - Uses reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms to evolve models over time.

2. **Self-Optimization Algorithms**:
   - Employs techniques like genetic algorithms and simulated annealing to optimize decision-making processes.
   - Automatically tunes hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization.

3. **Adaptive Decision-Making**:
   - Utilizes neural networks that are capable of online learning to adapt to new environments.
   - Implements meta-learning to improve the efficiency of learning processes.

4. **Modular Architecture**:
   - Designed to be easily integrated with existing systems.
   - Supports plug-and-play for various machine learning models.

5. **Explainability and Transparency Tools**:
   - Provides insights into model decisions using SHAP or LIME.
   - Logs and visualizes learning and optimization processes for analysis.

### Key Components Explained

1. **AutonomousLearningSystem**: The main class that encapsulates the functionality for recursive learning, feedback loops, and hyperparameter optimization.

2. **Recursive Learning**: Updates and leverages historical data for training models iteratively, allowing for model evolution over time.

3. **Feedback Loop**: After training a model, predictions are assessed, and insights are used to iteratively refine future models.

4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Uses Bayesian Optimization to automatically find the best hyperparameters for models, enhancing predictive performance.

This design can be expanded further based on specific needs, integrating more sophisticated models, deep learning frameworks, or distributed learning architectures.
