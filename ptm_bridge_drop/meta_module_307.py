To design a new Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably a fictional "PTM empire") self-evolving autonomy stack, we need to focus on building a scalable, modular, and recursive framework for autonomous operations. Below is a conceptual outline and some prototype code snippets that demonstrate how you might go about implementing such a module. The module will focus on leveraging machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, and recursive strategies to ensure adaptability and continuous improvement.

### Overview of the Module

1. **Self-Evolving Architectures**: Design agents that can learn and adapt recursively.
2. **Recursive Strategies**: Implement strategies that utilize recursion for decision making and learning.
3. **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Use genetic algorithms for developing robust adaptability.
4. **Modular Components**: Ensure each component is independently upgradable and replaceable.

### Example Components

1. **Agent**: Defines the autonomous agent with learning capabilities.

```python
# agent.py

class AutonomousAgent:
    def __init__(self, strategy, environment):
        self.strategy = strategy
        self.environment = environment
        self.history = []

    def perceive(self):
        # Perceive environment state
        state = self.environment.get_state()
        return state

    def act(self, action):
        # Execute action within the environment
        self.environment.apply_action(action)

    def learn(self, new_info):
        # Learn from new information
        self.history.append(new_info)
        self.strategy.update(self.history)

```

2. **Environment**: Simulates the dynamic and variable surroundings in which the agent operates.

```python
# environment.py

class Environment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = self._initialize_state()

    def _initialize_state(self):
        # Initialize environment state
        return {}

    def get_state(self):
        # Return the current state
        return self.state

    def apply_action(self, action):
        # Apply the given action, altering the state
        self.state['last_action'] = action
        # Implement state update logic

```

3. **Evolutionary Strategy**: Implements an evolutionary strategy for self-improvement.

```python
# evolution.py

import random

class EvolutionaryStrategy:
    def __init__(self, population_size):
        self.population_size = population_size

    def evolve(self, agents):
        # Simple genetic algorithm to evolve strategies
        next_generation = self.selection(agents)
        self.crossover(next_generation)
        self.mutation(next_generation)
        return next_generation

    def selection(self, agents):
        # Select the best performing agents
        sorted_agents = sorted(agents, key=lambda a: a.evaluate(), reverse=True)
        return sorted_agents[:self.population_size // 2]

    def crossover(self, agents):
        # Combine strategies of two agents
        pass

    def mutation(self, agents):
        # Mutate the strategy of an agent
        pass
```

4. **Recursive Learning**: Implements a recursive learning strategy for adaptability.

```python
# recursive_learning.py

class RecursiveLearning:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.memory = []

    def update(self, history):
        # Implement learning logic recursively
        if not history:
            return
        current_state = history.pop()
        self.learn_from_state(current_state)
        self.update(history)

    def learn_from_state(self, state):
        # Learn from a given state with a recursive aspect
        self.memory.append(state)
        # Recursive augmentation or transformation logic
```

### Considerations for Implementation

- **Scalability**: Ensure algorithms and data structures can handle large workloads.
- **Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests to ensure reliability.
- **Modularity**: Build components so they can easily be replaced without affecting the whole system.
- **Performance**: Efficient use of resources is critical, optimize for both time and space.

These are the basic building blocks for a Python module designed to expand PTM's self-evolving autonomy stack using recursive strategies and other innovative approaches. Further development would entail fleshing out each component, optimizing learning algorithms, and ensuring that the module is well-documented and extensible for future improvements.
