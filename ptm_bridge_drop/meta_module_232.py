Designing a new Python module for an autonomous system is a challenging task that involves integrating multiple aspects like perception, decision-making, and control. For the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack, we can create an innovative module that emphasizes recursive learning and adaptation strategies to enhance the system's autonomy. Below is a conceptual design for the module:

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Key Components

1. **Recursive Learning Engine (RLE):**
   - **Description:** Continuously refines its models by revisiting past experiences and feeding back into the system.
   - **Features:**
     - **Memory Augmentation:** Use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to maintain a persistent and evolving memory of past experiences.
     - **Experience Replay:** Maintains a buffer that is periodically sampled and re-evaluated to reinforce learning from diverse scenarios.

2. **Perception Module:**
   - **Description:** Processes sensory inputs and creates an environmental model.
   - **Features:**
     - **Multimodal Sensor Fusion:** Integrates data from different types of sensors (e.g., LiDAR, cameras, radar) to construct a comprehensive map.
     - **Recursive Noise Reduction:** Employing autoencoders to iteratively reduce noise and enhance signal clarity.

3. **Decision-Making Core:**
   - **Description:** Determines the best course of action based on current state and objectives.
   - **Features:**
     - **Recursive Decision Trees (RDT):** Dynamic decision trees that adapt their structure based on feedback loops from past outcomes.
     - **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL):** Uses a hierarchy of simple policies to manage complex behaviors more efficiently.

4. **Control System:**
   - **Description:** Converts decisions into actionable commands for actuation.
   - **Features:**
     - **Adaptive PID Controllers:** PID control loops that self-tune based on environmental feedback to optimize performance.
     - **Model Predictive Control (MPC):** Incorporates future state predictions into the command generation process for smoother operation.

5. **Self-Evolving Agent (SEA):**
   - **Description:** Oversees the self-improvement of the autonomy stack.
   - **Features:**
     - **Genetic Algorithms:** Implements recursive genetic algorithms to optimize hyperparameters and network structures over time.
     - **Regular Performance Evaluation:** Periodically assesses system performance against designated benchmarks and triggers learning phases as needed.

6. **Simulation Interface:**
   - **Description:** Simulators for testing and training the autonomous stack in virtual environments.
   - **Features:**
     - **Recursive Scenario Generation:** Automatically generates a variety of scenarios that evolve based on historical performance metrics for robustness testing.

#### Sample Code Sketch

```python
class PTMAutonomy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.perception = PerceptionModule()
        self.decision_maker = DecisionMakingCore()
        self.control_system = ControlSystem()
        self.rle = RecursiveLearningEngine()
        self.sea = SelfEvolvingAgent()

    def update(self, sensory_data):
        # Perception
        environment_model = self.perception.process(sensory_data)
        
        # Decision-Making
        action_plan = self.decision_maker.decide(environment_model)
        
        # Control
        self.control_system.execute(action_plan)
        
        # Learning and Evolution
        self.rle.learn_from_experience(environment_model, action_plan)
        self.sea.optimize(self)

class RecursiveLearningEngine:
    def learn_from_experience(self, state, action):
        # Implement experience replay and recursive learning logic
        pass

class SelfEvolvingAgent:
    def optimize(self, autonomy_instance):
        # Perform evolutionary strategies to enhance system capabilities
        pass

# Example usage:
autonomy = PTMAutonomy()
while True:
    sensory_data = get_sensory_input()
    autonomy.update(sensory_data)
```

### Final Considerations
This module will act as a cornerstone for building a robust and evolving autonomous system for the PTM empire. It balances innovative recursive strategies with practical considerations of system performance and adaptability. Future expansions could include advances in quantum computing to further enhance recursive algorithms or blockchain technologies for immutable decision logs.
