Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional entity) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a thoughtful approach to incorporating innovative and recursive strategies. The goal is to create a module that:

1. **Learns Autonomously**: The system can adapt and optimize itself without external intervention.
2. **Uses Recursive Strategies**: It refines its own processes by continually re-applying its algorithms to improve over time.
3. **Remains Modular and Extensible**: Allows for seamless integration with existing systems and future expansion.

Below is a sample design of a Python module that integrates these features:

```python
import random
import logging
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Setting up logging for debugging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

class AutonomyModule(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for different strategies in the autonomy stack.
    """
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, data):
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def refine(self, feedback):
        pass

class EvolutionaryStrategy(AutonomyModule):
    """
    Implements a simple evolutionary algorithm as a recursive strategy.
    """
    def __init__(self, population_size=10, mutation_rate=0.1):
        self.population_size = population_size
        self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate
        self.population = [self.random_solution() for _ in range(population_size)]
        logging.info(f"Initialized with population: {self.population}")

    def random_solution(self):
        return random.uniform(-10, 10)

    def fitness(self, solution):
        # Example fitness function: maximize the square of the solution.
        return solution ** 2

    def mutate(self, solution):
        return solution + random.uniform(-self.mutation_rate, self.mutation_rate)

    def select_parents(self):
        sorted_population = sorted(self.population, key=self.fitness, reverse=True)
        return sorted_population[:2]  # Select two best solutions
    
    def create_offspring(self, parent1, parent2):
        return (parent1 + parent2) / 2  # Simple crossover

    def execute(self, data):
        best_solution = max(self.population, key=self.fitness)
        logging.debug(f"Best current solution: {best_solution}")
        return best_solution

    def refine(self, feedback=None):
        parent1, parent2 = self.select_parents()
        logging.debug(f"Selected parents: {parent1}, {parent2}")
        
        # Create new population with offspring and mutations
        new_population = [self.create_offspring(parent1, parent2) for _ in range(self.population_size//2)]
        new_population += [self.mutate(ind) for ind in self.population]
        self.population = new_population
        logging.info(f"New population: {self.population}")

# Client code for using the self-evolving autonomy stack
if __name__ == "__main__":
    strategy = EvolutionaryStrategy()
    
    # Simulation of the autonomy stack's operation
    for generation in range(10):
        logging.info(f"Generation {generation}")
        solution = strategy.execute(None)
        logging.info(f"Best solution at generation {generation}: {solution}")
        strategy.refine()

```

### Key Features:

- **Abstract Base Class**: `AutonomyModule` serves as an interface for different autonomy strategies, allowing the addition of various self-evolving strategies.

- **Evolutionary Strategy**: Implements a basic evolutionary algorithm with recursive components. It maintains a population of solutions, selects the best ones, and creates offspring through crossover and mutation.

- **Autonomy and Improvement Through Recursion**: The `refine` method improves the solution through recursive selection and mutation.

### Strategy and Extensibility:

- The module demonstrates how new strategies can be added by extending `AutonomyModule`.
- The current solution uses evolutionary algorithms, but you can integrate additional strategies like genetic programming, reinforcement learning, or neural networks by implementing different classes.

This module serves as a foundational component that can be incorporated into the PTM empire's larger autonomy stack, facilitating ongoing evolution and optimization of its operations.
