Designing a Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably Autonomous Systems – given no specific information on PTM, this is a general assumption) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack involves tapping into recursive strategies to enhance adaptability and self-improvement. Below is a conceptual design outline with a focus on architecture and capabilities. Additional specific capabilities would be necessary depending on the particular domain the PTM operates within (e.g., transportation, robotics, data processing).

### Module: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Module Goals
- Enhance autonomy with self-evolving mechanisms.
- Integrate recursive strategies for self-improvement.
- Enable flexible, scalable operational enhancements.

#### Core Components

1. **Self-Evaluation Engine (`self_evaluation.py`)**
   - **Purpose:** Continuously assesses system performance.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Metrics Collection: Define KPIs and collect data.
     - Recursive Assessment: Evaluate current state, compare with historical data, identify performance deviations.

   ```python
   class SelfEvaluationEngine:
       def __init__(self, metrics):
           self.metrics = metrics
           self.historical_data = []

       def evaluate(self, current_performance):
           self.historical_data.append(current_performance)
           # Recursive strategy to compare with past performances
           return self.recursive_evaluation(current_performance)

       def recursive_evaluation(self, data):
           # Implement a recursive evaluation strategy
           performance_difference = [
               (current - previous) for current, previous in zip(data, self.historical_data[-2])
           ]
           return performance_difference

   ```

2. **Adaptive Learning Module (`adaptive_learning.py`)**
   - **Purpose:** Expand the system's knowledge base through recursive learning algorithms.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Machine Learning: Recursive Neural Networks for pattern recognition.
     - Feedback Loop: Iteratively improve the decision-making process.

   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

   class AdaptiveLearningModule:
       def __init__(self, model=None):
           self.model = model or RandomForestClassifier()
           self.data = []

       def train(self, features, labels):
           X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2)
           self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
           return self.model.score(X_test, y_test)

       def update_with_new_data(self, new_data, new_labels):
           self.data.append((new_data, new_labels))
           # Recursive retraining
           self.train(*self.aggregate_data())

       def aggregate_data(self):
           features, labels = zip(*self.data)
           return features, labels

   ```

3. **Decision-Making Framework (`decision_making.py`)**
   - **Purpose:** Make informed decisions using recursive optimization.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Decision Trees or Genetic Algorithms: Applying recursion for optimization.
     - Scenario Simulation: Evaluate potential outcomes recursively.

   ```python
   class DecisionMakingFramework:
       def __init__(self):
           pass

       def make_decision(self, state_context):
           # Recursive decision-making strategy
           return self.recursive_decision(state_context)

       def recursive_decision(self, context, depth=0):
           # Recursive function for evaluating scenarios
           if depth > some_threshold:
               return self.simple_decision(context)

           best_option = None
           for option in self.evaluate_options(context):
               result = self.recursive_decision(self.simulate(option), depth + 1)
               # Choose the best result based on defined criteria
               if self.is_better(result, best_option):
                   best_option = result
           return best_option

       def evaluate_options(self, context):
           # Generate possible actions or scenarios
           pass

       def simulate(self, option):
           # Simulate an option's outcome
           pass

       def is_better(self, result, best_option):
           # Comparison logic to determine the best option
           pass

   ```

#### Additional Considerations
- **Scalability:** Design with distributed systems in mind to handle large data sets and complex recursive evaluations.
- **Security and Ethics:** Implement security protocols and ethical considerations for autonomous actions.
- **Integration:** Ensure compatibility with existing PTM systems and APIs.

This design provides a robust framework for enhancing the autonomy and adaptability of systems under the PTM empire. Customization and domain-specific expansion would further refine this module to meet specific operational needs.
