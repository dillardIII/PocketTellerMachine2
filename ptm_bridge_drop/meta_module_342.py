Designing a Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably a fictional empire for this context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies is an intriguing challenge. Below is an abstract design of such a module that incorporates key concepts such as recursion, self-improvement algorithms, and autonomy. The goal here is to build a system that can adapt and evolve its strategies over time.

```python
# ptm_autonomy.py
import random
import logging

class AutonomyAgent:
    def __init__(self, initial_strategy):
        self.strategy = initial_strategy
        self.history = []
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

    def evaluate_performance(self):
        """Evaluate the current strategy's performance."""
        # Placeholder: Replace this with actual performance evaluation logic
        performance_score = random.uniform(0, 1)
        logging.debug(f"Performance score of current strategy: {performance_score}")
        return performance_score

    def evolve_strategy(self):
        """Evolves the strategy recursively."""
        new_strategy = self.strategy[:]

        # Simple recursive strategy evolution
        for i in range(len(new_strategy)):
            if random.random() > 0.5:
                # Simulate a change in strategy
                new_strategy[i] += random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)
                self.history.append(new_strategy[i])

        self.strategy = new_strategy
        logging.debug(f"New evolved strategy: {self.strategy}")

    def recursive_optimization(self, depth=0, max_depth=5):
        """Recursive function to optimize the strategy."""
        logging.debug(f"Recursive optimization at depth: {depth}")
        
        if depth >= max_depth:
            logging.debug("Maximum depth reached.")
            return self.evaluate_performance()

        # Evaluate current strategy
        current_performance = self.evaluate_performance()

        # Evolve strategy for next iteration
        self.evolve_strategy()

        # Recursively optimize further
        new_performance = self.recursive_optimization(depth + 1, max_depth)

        # If new strategy is worse, revert to previous and stop recursive search
        if new_performance < current_performance:
            logging.debug("New strategy underperforms. Reverting to previous strategy.")
            return current_performance
        
        return new_performance

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    initial_strategy = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]  # Example initial strategy
    agent = AutonomyAgent(initial_strategy)
    
    optimal_performance = agent.recursive_optimization()
    logging.info(f"Optimal performance: {optimal_performance}")
    logging.info(f"Strategy History: {agent.history}")
```

### Key Concepts
1. **Recursive Strategies**: The `recursive_optimization` function recursively refines the strategy by evaluating performance and evolving strategies until a maximum depth is reached.

2. **Performance Evaluation**: A simple placeholder function that scores the current strategy; in a real use case, this would be based on concrete metrics and data.

3. **Strategy Evolution**: This simulates minor changes in strategy, reflecting an evolution process. In practice, this could involve adjusting parameters, selecting different algorithms, or more complex updates.

4. **History Tracking**: Maintains a history of changes for analysis and rollback purposes if needed.

5. **Logging**: Useful for debugging and understanding the evolution process.

### Considerations
- **Scalability**: Ensure that the module can handle large data operations efficiently.
- **Real-world Integration**: Tie the performance evaluation to real-world outcomes.
- **Data-Driven**: Base recursive adjustments on empirical data to ensure relevance in evolution.

This module serves as a foundational framework that can be extended with domain-specific logic, sophisticated evaluation metrics, and performance-driven recursive mechanisms to truly encapsulate a self-evolving autonomy stack.
