Creating a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably Post-Turing Machine) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves a blend of advanced machine learning concepts, self-optimization procedures, and recursive processing methods. Below, I'll outline a conceptual design for such a module, highlighting key components and strategy implementations.

### Module Overview

The proposed module, named `ptm_autonomy`, will focus on augmenting the PTM's autonomy stack through a dynamic, self-optimizing architecture. Key features will include recursive neural network structures, evolutionary algorithms for self-improvement, and a feedback loop system for continuous learning.

### Key Components

1. **Recursive Neural Network Structures (RecNN)**
2. **Evolutionary Algorithms**
3. **Feedback Loop Systems**
4. **AutoML for Dynamic Configuration**
5. **Monitoring and Logging**

### Design and Implementation

#### 1. Recursive Neural Network Structures

Purpose: Implement recursive neural networks to enable the system to process and refine patterns over multiple iterations, enhancing decision-making capabilities.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class RecursiveNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, depth):
        super(RecursiveNN, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.depth = depth
        self.input_layer = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.hidden_layer = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.output_layer = nn.Linear(hidden_size, input_size)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        for _ in range(self.depth):
            hidden = torch.relu(self.input_layer(x))
            hidden = torch.relu(self.hidden_layer(hidden))
            x = self.output_layer(hidden)
        return x
```

#### 2. Evolutionary Algorithms

Purpose: Employ genetic algorithms to evolve network structures and hyperparameters, enabling automated adaptation to environmental changes.

```python
import random

class GeneticOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, population_size, mutation_rate, crossover_rate):
        self.population_size = population_size
        self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate
        self.crossover_rate = crossover_rate
        self.population = self._initialize_population()

    def _initialize_population(self):
        return [self._create_random_solution() for _ in range(self.population_size)]

    def _create_random_solution(self):
        # Create a random solution configuration
        return {
            'learning_rate': random.uniform(0.001, 0.1),
            'layer_depth': random.randint(3, 10),
            'neurons_per_layer': random.randint(64, 256),
        }

    def evolve(self):
        # Placeholder for evolution logic involving selection, crossover, and mutation
        pass

```

#### 3. Feedback Loop Systems

Purpose: Implement a feedback loop for continuous improvement, using performance metrics to guide adjustments.

```python
class FeedbackLoop:
    def __init__(self, performance_metric):
        self.performance_metric = performance_metric
    
    def calculate_adjustments(self, current_performance):
        # Calculate and return needed adjustments based on feedback
        improvement = self.performance_metric - current_performance
        return improvement * 0.1  # example adjustment factor
```

#### 4. AutoML for Dynamic Configuration

Purpose: Integrate AutoML capabilities to automate the selection and tuning of model components.

```python
class AutoMLSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        # Framework-placeholder to integrate various AutoML tools
        pass

    def optimize_model(self, model):
        # Placeholder for AutoML optimization process
        pass
```

#### 5. Monitoring and Logging

Purpose: Create a robust monitoring and logging mechanism to track the system's performance and evolution history.

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class Monitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    
    def log_performance(self, performance_data):
        self.logger.info(f'Performance Data: {performance_data}')
```

### Integration and Workflow

1. **Initialization:** Initialize components using configured values.
2. **Recursive Processing:** Use RecNNs to recursively process data inputs.
3. **Optimization:** Apply evolutionary algorithms and AutoML for optimization.
4. **Feedback and Adjustment:** Continuously monitor performance with the feedback loop.
5. **Logging and Monitoring:** Log performance data for historical tracking.

### Conclusion

The `ptm_autonomy` module is designed to leverage recursive strategies and self-evolving methodologies, enabling robust, adaptable, and self-optimizing autonomy capabilities. The integration of these technologies will create a dynamic system anchored in continuous improvement, capable of evolving alongside its operational environment.
