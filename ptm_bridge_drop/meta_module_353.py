Creating a new Python module to expand a self-evolving autonomy stack for the PTM (Presumably something like a Process, Task, and Management) empire involves several key components. These components must leverage recursive strategies to allow the system to self-improve and adapt over time. Below is a high-level outline of how we might design such a module, including innovative recursive strategies.

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy_expansion`

#### Key Components

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**:
   - Gather real-time data from various sources.
   - Use a recursive data cleaning method to continuously improve data quality.

2. **Self-Evolving Knowledge Base**:
   - Implement a dynamic database with recursive update capabilities.
   - Use machine learning to recursively refine and expand the knowledge base.

3. **Adaptive Decision-Making Engine**:
   - Use reinforcement learning strategies with recursive improvement loops.
   - Implement a feedback loop mechanism where past decisions are analyzed and inform future decision-making.

4. **Recursive Strategy Optimizer**:
   - Automatically generates new strategies and refines existing ones using recursive neural networks.
   - Continuously evaluates performance metrics to fine-tune strategies.

5. **Self-Monitoring Capabilities**:
   - Real-time monitoring of system health and performance.
   - Recursive anomaly detection and correction mechanisms.

6. **Human-in-the-Loop Configurations**:
   - Incorporate human feedback through recursive learning cycles.
   - Use human feedback to iteratively improve system strategies and responses.

7. **Interface and Communication Layer**:
   - Develop APIs for seamless integration with other modules and systems.
   - Incorporate recursive communication protocols to ensure robust and fault-tolerant operations.

#### Innovative Recursive Strategies

1. **Recursive Neural Network Integration**:
   - Use recursive neural networks (RNNs) to capture sequential dependencies and improve predictive accuracy.

2. **Recursive Feature Extraction**:
   - Implement a feature extraction process that recursively identifies and refines necessary features for the decision-making engine.

3. **Recursive Model Selection**:
   - Continuously evaluate and select the best-performing models using recursive benchmarking techniques.

4. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**:
   - Use recursive feedback loops to allocate computational resources based on real-time demand and historical patterns.

#### Example Code Snippets

Here are some simplified code snippets to give you an idea of the potential implementation:

```python
# Recursive Data Cleaning Function
def recursive_data_cleaning(data, iteration=0):
    # Basic cleaning operations
    cleaned_data = basic_clean(data)
    
    # Recursive improvement if further cleaning is needed
    if needs_further_cleaning(cleaned_data) and iteration < MAX_ITERATIONS:
        return recursive_data_cleaning(cleaned_data, iteration + 1)
    return cleaned_data

# Self-Evolving Knowledge Base
class KnowledgeBase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}
    
    def update_recursive(self, new_data):
        # Simulate recursive update mechanism
        self.data.update(new_data)
        self.refine_knowledge(recursion_depth=0)
    
    def refine_knowledge(self, recursion_depth):
        if recursion_depth < MAX_RECURSIVE_DEPTH:
            # Logic to improve the knowledge base
            self.data = refine(self.data)
            self.refine_knowledge(recursion_depth + 1)

# Recursive Strategy Optimizer
class StrategyOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_strategy = initial_strategy()
    
    def optimize_recursively(self, feedback):
        new_strategy = refine_strategy(self.current_strategy, feedback)
        
        # Recursive refinement
        if strategy_needs_improvement(new_strategy):
            self.current_strategy = self.optimize_recursively(feedback)
        return self.current_strategy
```

### Conclusion

This design proposes a modular approach to expanding the PTM empire's autonomy stack with recursive strategies. The recursive strategies focus on iterative refinement and learning, leveraging data feedback and human inputs to continually evolve and optimize system performance. The provided code snippets offer a foundational blueprint that can be expanded into a full-fledged module.
