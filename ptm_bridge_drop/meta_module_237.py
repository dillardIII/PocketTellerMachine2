Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably, a hypothetical empire with technological or computational goals) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires careful consideration of innovative strategies, particularly focusing on recursive strategies. Below is an outline for a module named `autonomy_stack.py` that incorporates recursive learning and self-optimization techniques:

### Module: autonomy_stack.py

#### Key Features:

1. **Recursive Learning Algorithms**: Implementing recursive strategies for continuous self-improvement.
2. **Self-Optimization Framework**: Techniques to optimize decision-making processes.
3. **Adaptive Cognitive Layer**: To enhance decision-making and adaptability.
4. **Feedback Loops**: For perpetual learning and adjustment.

#### Implementation Plan:

```python
class AutonomousSystem:
    def __init__(self, initial_state):
        self.state = initial_state
        self.history = []

    def recursive_learn(self, input_data):
        # Basic recursive learning strategy
        # Process input data and modify internal state
        self.history.append(self.state)
        self.state = self._recursive_update(self.state, input_data)

    def _recursive_update(self, current_state, input_data):
        # Placeholder for complex recursive update logic
        # This should involve a model that learns and evolves
        updated_state = current_state  # Example transformation
        # TODO: Implement sophisticated logic here
        return updated_state
    
    def self_optimize(self):
        # Self-optimization by revisiting past states
        for previous_state in reversed(self.history):
            # Placeholder for optimization logic
            pass
        # TODO: Include optimization strategies (e.g., genetic algorithms)

    def adaptive_decision_maker(self, environment_data):
        # Adapt decisions based on current state and environment
        action = self._assess_and_choose_action(environment_data)
        return action

    def _assess_and_choose_action(self, environment_data):
        # Assess current environment data and choose action
        action = None
        # TODO: Implement decision-making logic; potentially using
        # reinforcement learning or other techniques
        return action

    def enhanced_feedback_loop(self, feedback_data):
        # Integrate feedback for perpetual learning
        # Potentially adjust future actions based on feedback
        self.state = self._process_feedback(feedback_data)

    def _process_feedback(self, feedback_data):
        # Analyze feedback and alter state accordingly
        processed_state = self.state
        # TODO: Develop complex feedback handling
        return processed_state

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    initial_state = {"level": 0, "experience": 0}
    autonomy_system = AutonomousSystem(initial_state)

    # Simulate environment input
    environment_input = {"data": "example_environment_data"}
    autonomy_system.recursive_learn(environment_input)

    # Simulate feedback loop
    feedback_input = {"feedback": "example_feedback"}
    autonomy_system.enhanced_feedback_loop(feedback_input)
    
    # Print updated state
    print(autonomy_system.state)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Recursive Learning**: The `recursive_learn` method is designed to process input data recursively, enabling the system to evolve its state continuously.

2. **Self-Optimization**: A framework for traversing historical states and applying optimization techniques to improve the system’s efficiency and decision-making process.

3. **Adaptive Cognitive Layer**: The `adaptive_decision_maker` function allows the system to make informed decisions by integrating data from its environment.

4. **Feedback Loops**: The `enhanced_feedback_loop` function processes feedback to ensure the system learns from past actions, improving future performance.

### Extensibility:

- **Machine Learning and AI**: Consider integrating machine learning algorithms for more sophisticated recursive learning and self-optimization.
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Use these for optimization tasks to simulate evolutionary strategies in decision-making processes.
- **Hybrid Systems**: Combine rule-based systems with neural networks to enhance flexibility and accuracy.

### Conclusion:

This module provides a foundational framework that can be further extended with sophisticated algorithms and approaches to effectively contribute to an autonomous, self-evolving system, crucial for the expansion of the PTM empire’s technological capabilities.
