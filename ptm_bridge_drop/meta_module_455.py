Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably an acronym for a specific autonomous system project) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies requires a structured yet adaptable approach. Below is an outline for such a module. This concept aims to utilize recursive learning, self-optimization, and autonomous decisions based on real-world feedback.

### Design Outline for PTM Autonomy Module

#### Module Name
`ptm_autonomy`

#### Key Features
1. **Recursive Learning System**: Continuously improves performance by analyzing outcomes of past decisions and learning from them.
2. **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Utilizes a combination of rule-based systems and machine learning to make real-time decisions based on current context and historical data.
3. **Feedback Loop Integration**: Incorporates feedback from the environment to adjust strategies dynamically.
4. **Multi-agent Coordination**: Facilitates interaction between multiple autonomous agents to perform tasks more efficiently.
5. **Simulation and Testing**: A built-in simulation environment for testing various strategies and decisions before real-world deployment.

#### Module Structure

##### 1. Initialization and Configuration
This submodule will handle configuration settings such as defining goals, constraints, agent properties, and environmental parameters.

```python
class Configuration:
    def __init__(self, goals, constraints, agent_properties):
        self.goals = goals
        self.constraints = constraints
        self.agent_properties = agent_properties

    def validate(self):
        # Ensure the configuration meets the necessary requirements.
        pass
```

##### 2. Recursive Learning System
Implements the learning algorithms necessary for adaptive behavior.

```python
class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.model = self._initialize_model()

    def _initialize_model(self):
        # Initialize the machine learning model (e.g., neural network, decision tree)
        pass

    def update_model(self, data):
        # Update model using new data
        pass

    def predict(self, state):
        # Predict the next best action based on current state
        pass
```

##### 3. Decision-Making Engine
Combines rule-based logic with machine learning predictions for context-aware decisions.

```python
class DecisionEngine:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model

    def make_decision(self, context):
        # Use the model to predict optimal actions
        action = self.model.predict(context) 
        return action

    def apply_rules(self, context):
        # Rule-based checks and balances to refine decisions
        pass
```

##### 4. Feedback Loop Integration
Gathers real-time data and adjusts strategies accordingly.

```python
class FeedbackLoop:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []

    def capture_feedback(self, outcome, context):
        # Capture and analyze feedback to improve future decisions
        self.history.append((outcome, context))
        self.adapt_strategy()

    def adapt_strategy(self):
        # Adapt the strategy based on accumulated feedback
        pass
```

##### 5. Multi-Agent Coordination
Coordinates interactions between autonomous agents to ensure cooperative task execution.

```python
class MultiAgentCoordinator:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        self.agents = agents

    def coordinate(self):
        # Strategies for agent-to-agent communication and coordination
        pass
```

##### 6. Simulation and Testing
Simulates real-world scenarios to test and refine strategies.

```python
class Simulator:
    def __init__(self, environment, agents):
        self.environment = environment
        self.agents = agents

    def run_simulation(self):
        # Simulate and log agent actions within the environment
        pass

    def evaluate_performance(self):
        # Analyze simulation outcomes to assess and enhance strategy
        pass
```

#### Example Usage

```python
from ptm_autonomy import Configuration, RecursiveLearner, DecisionEngine, FeedbackLoop, MultiAgentCoordinator, Simulator

# Example configuration
config = Configuration(goals=["optimize_efficiency"], constraints={"speed_limit": 50}, agent_properties={"type": "vehicle"})
config.validate()

# Initialize system components
learner = RecursiveLearner(learning_rate=0.1)
decision_engine = DecisionEngine(model=learner)
feedback_loop = FeedbackLoop()
coordinator = MultiAgentCoordinator(agents=[...])

# Run a mock simulation
simulator = Simulator(environment='urban', agents=[...])
simulator.run_simulation()
simulator.evaluate_performance()
```

### Innovation Elements
- **Recursive Learning**: Continuously updates the model by learning from each interaction.
- **Adaptive Feedback Integration**: Real-time adjustment of strategies based on feedback.
- **Multi-Agent Dynamics**: Ensures optimal performance in a multi-agent setup, emphasizing cooperation.
- **Real-World Simulation**: Provides a robust testing platform, reducing real-world deployment risks.

This module design combines learning, adaptation, and strategic decision-making to enhance the autonomy and efficiency of the PTM empire's autonomous systems.
