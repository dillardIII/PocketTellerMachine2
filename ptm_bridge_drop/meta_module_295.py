Creating a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably a fictional autonomous system) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack can be an intriguing challenge. The goal here would be to implement recursive strategies that allow adaptability and learning over time, potentially using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. For this task, we might focus on aspects such as:

1. **Self-learning and Adaptability**: Use machine learning models to allow the system to learn from its environment and improve continuously.

2. **Recursive Improvement**: Implement strategies where solutions can be repeatedly refined and improved through recursion strategies.

3. **Decentralized Decision Making**: Allow parts of the autonomy stack to make decisions independently while still aligning with global objectives.

4. **Reflection Mechanisms**: Enable the system to assess its own performance and initiate changes to improve.

Here's a very high-level architecture for such a Python module and some code snippets to illustrate the concepts:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier()
    
    def preprocess_data(self):
        # Example: Normalizes the input data
        normalized_data = (self.data - np.mean(self.data, axis=0)) / np.std(self.data, axis=0)
        return normalized_data
    
    def train_model(self, features, labels):
        # Split data for training and testing
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2)
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions = self.model.predict(X_test)
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
        print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")
    
    def recursive_refinement(self, data, labels, iterations=5):
        """ Recursively refine the model over multiple iterations"""
        for i in range(iterations):
            print(f"Iteration {i+1}")
            self.train_model(data, labels)

            # Hypothetically, adjust the dataset or training parameters based on feedback loop to improve further
            # This can be expanded to more sophisticated feedback loops that involve environment interaction
            # or more complex model retraining strategies.
    
    def decentralized_decision(self, input_data):
        decision = self.model.predict(input_data)
        return decision
        

# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    #Example data
    np.random.seed(42)
    example_data = np.random.rand(100, 10)  # Dummy dataset with 100 instances and 10 features
    example_labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=100)  # Binary labels

    # Initialize autonomy stack
    autonomy = AutonomyStack(example_data)
    processed_data = autonomy.preprocess_data()
    autonomy.recursive_refinement(processed_data, example_labels)
    
    # Example decision making
    new_input = processed_data[0].reshape(1, -1)
    decision = autonomy.decentralized_decision(new_input)
    print(f"Decentralized Decision: {decision}")
```

### Key Points:

- **Preprocessing**: Using normalization for data preprocessing.
  
- **Training Cycle**: A random forest classifier as a foundational model which in real scenarios can be replaced or extended with more sophisticated methods like deep learning models.

- **Recursive Refinement**: An iterative mechanism to retrain or adjust the model. In a real-world scenario, this loop might include strategies for adjusting hyperparameters, re-evaluating feature importance, or integrating additional data sources.

- **Decentralized Decisions**: Though simplified, the method `decentralized_decision` showcases the capability to process and make decisions based on learned data.

This is a simplified, illustrative model. In a full-fledged system, more complex datasets, environmental interactions, and advanced model architectures and optimization strategies would be critical. Techniques like reinforcement learning could also play a significant role in developing a truly autonomous, self-evolving system.
