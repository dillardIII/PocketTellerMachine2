Designing a Python module to expand PTM's (Presumably a fictional entity for this scenario) self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that adapts and evolves over time. The following is a high-level design of such a module, focusing on recursive strategies for self-improvement and adaptation.

### Module: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Key Components

1. **Self-Monitoring Subsystem**
   - Continuously evaluates the performance of the autonomy stack.
   - Collects data on decision-making processes and outcomes.
   - Identifies areas of improvement and success.

2. **Recursive Learning Algorithm**
   - Implements reinforcement learning with a focus on recursive strategies.
   - Learns from its own outputs to iteratively improve performance.
   - Employs mechanisms like simulation environments to test various scenarios and outcomes.

3. **Adaptation Engine**
   - Dynamically adjusts algorithms based on feedback from the self-monitoring subsystem.
   - Includes a rule-based system to determine when and how to update strategies.

4. **Knowledge Base**
   - Stores learned behaviors, strategies, and performance data.
   - Utilizes a hybrid approach combining traditional databases and AI-driven insights for data storage and retrieval.

5. **Strategy Optimizer**
   - Uses genetic algorithms to explore and refine potential strategies.
   - Explores a wide array of strategies and chooses optimal paths based on specific performance metrics.

6. **Interface Layer**
   - Provides interfaces for integration with other components of PTM's stack.
   - Supports APIs for real-time data exchange and decision-making.

#### Python Module: `ptm_autonomy.py`

Here is a high-level implementation of the module:

```python
import random
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

class SelfMonitoringSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_data = []

    def evaluate_performance(self, decisions, outcomes):
        error = mean_squared_error(decisions, outcomes)
        self.performance_data.append(error)
        return error
    
    def identify_improvements(self):
        if len(self.performance_data) > 1:
            improvement = self.performance_data[-2] - self.performance_data[-1]
        else:
            improvement = 0
        return improvement

class RecursiveLearningAlgorithm:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = self.initialize_model()
    
    def initialize_model(self):
        # Placeholder for model initialization
        return None
    
    def learn_from_experience(self, scenarios, results):
        for scenario, result in zip(scenarios, results):
            # Implement recursive learning logic here
            pass
    
    def test_strategies(self, environment):
        # Placeholder for testing strategies in a simulated environment
        return random.choice(environment)

class AdaptationEngine:
    def __init__(self, monitoring_system):
        self.monitoring_system = monitoring_system

    def adjust_strategies(self, learning_algorithm):
        improvement = self.monitoring_system.identify_improvements()
        if improvement < 0:
            # Adjust learning parameters
            pass

class StrategyOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategies = []

    def explore_strategies(self):
        # Implement genetic algorithm or other optimization techniques
        pass

    def select_optimal_strategy(self):
        return random.choice(self.strategies)

class PTMAutonomy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.monitoring_system = SelfMonitoringSystem()
        self.learning_algorithm = RecursiveLearningAlgorithm()
        self.adaptation_engine = AdaptationEngine(self.monitoring_system)
        self.strategy_optimizer = StrategyOptimizer()

    def run(self, scenarios, outcomes):
        decisions = self.simulate_decisions(scenarios)
        performance = self.monitoring_system.evaluate_performance(decisions, outcomes)
        self.learning_algorithm.learn_from_experience(scenarios, outcomes)
        self.adaptation_engine.adjust_strategies(self.learning_algorithm)

    def simulate_decisions(self, scenarios):
        # Placeholder for decision simulation
        return np.random.choice(range(10), size=len(scenarios))

# Example usage
ptm_autonomy = PTMAutonomy()
scenarios = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Placeholder for real scenarios
outcomes = [1.1, 2.0, 3.2, 3.9, 5.1]  # Placeholder for real outcomes
ptm_autonomy.run(scenarios, outcomes)
```

#### Key Points

- **Iterative and Recursive Approach**: The system should continuously evaluate and improve itself through recursive strategies, learning from its own outputs to refine decision-making processes.
- **Adaptation and Flexibility**: The system should be capable of adapting its strategies in response to new data, ensuring it remains effective as situations evolve.
- **Integration and Interoperability**: A robust interface layer ensures that this module can be seamlessly integrated into PTM's broader ecosystem, allowing real-time communication and decision-making.

This structure should serve as a foundation for building a self-evolving autonomy stack tailored for PTM's needs. Depending on specific requirements, each component can be further developed and refined.
