Designing a new Python module to enhance the self-evolving autonomy stack for the PTM empire involves incorporating cutting-edge recursive strategies. Let's construct a high-level design incorporating various advanced concepts such as machine learning algorithms, artificial intelligence, and recursive optimization. This module will focus on adaptability, efficiency, and continuous improvement.

### Key Components of the Module

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
   - Interface with various sensors and data streams.
   - Implement data cleaning, normalization, and transformation.
   - Use recursive data integration to handle new data types without manual intervention.

2. **Machine Learning (ML) Models:**
   - Deploy reinforced learning for behavior optimization.
   - Use recursive neural networks (RNN) for pattern recognition.
   - Integrate generative models for scenario simulation.

3. **Self-evolving Algorithms:**
   - Develop self-modifying code using genetic programming.
   - Implement tree-based recursion to navigate complex decision-making trees.
   - Use meta-learning to allow the system to adapt learning methods based on past performance.

4. **Autonomy and Control System:**
   - Design a modular control system using feedback loops.
   - Apply recursive control theory for stability in dynamic environments.
   - Incorporate predictive control to pre-emptively adjust strategies.

5. **Recursive Optimization:**
   - Use multi-agent systems to simulate and solve complex tasks.
   - Apply recursive partitioning to break down problems into sub-problems.
   - Optimize using recursive gradient descent in neural networks.

6. **Monitoring and Feedback:**
   - Implement telemetry and health-check systems.
   - Develop an adaptive feedback loop to fine-tune model parameters autonomously.
   - Use recursive anomaly detection to detect and rectify system faults.

### Implementation Outline

```python
# Placeholder for a Python module design

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from scipy.optimize import minimize_recursive # hypothetical recursive optimizer

class AutonomousEmpireModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_buffer = []
        self.model = self._initialize_model()
        self.scaler = StandardScaler()

    def _initialize_model(self):
        # Use a basic RNN structure for recursive learning tasks
        return tf.keras.Sequential([
            tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(32, input_shape=(None, 1)),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
        ])

    def preprocess_data(self, raw_data):
        # Apply recursive preprocessing strategy
        self.data_buffer.append(raw_data)
        if len(self.data_buffer) > 1000:
            self.data_buffer.pop(0)
        processed_data = self.scaler.fit_transform(np.array(self.data_buffer))
        return processed_data

    def optimize_model(self, data, labels):
        # Recursive optimization routine
        def loss_function(params):
            self.model.set_weights(params)
            predictions = self.model.predict(data)
            return np.mean((predictions - labels) ** 2)

        initial_params = self.model.get_weights()
        result = minimize_recursive(loss_function, initial_params)
        self.model.set_weights(result['optimal_params'])

    def predict(self, new_data):
        processed_data = self.preprocess_data(new_data)
        return self.model.predict(processed_data)

    def adapt_and_evolve(self):
        # Meta-learning and recursive strategy adaptations
        new_method = self._discover_new_method()
        self.model = new_method(self.model)

    def _discover_new_method(self):
        # Hypothetical method for evolving new strategies
        pass

# Usage example:
empire_module = AutonomousEmpireModule()
input_data = np.random.random((100, 1))
empire_module.optimize_model(input_data, labels=np.random.random(100))
predictions = empire_module.predict(np.random.random((10, 1)))
```

### Considerations

1. **Scalability:**
   - Ensure the module can scale with increasing data and complexity.
   - Use distributed computing and cloud-based services when necessary.

2. **Security:**
   - Implement robust security measures for data privacy and protection.
   - Regularly update the system against vulnerabilities.

3. **Usability:**
   - Provide comprehensive documentation and examples for ease of integration.
   - Develop an intuitive API for interacting with the module.

This outline provides a foundation for developing a recursive, self-evolving autonomy framework that can drive the PTM empire's strategic and operational needs. More detailed design and testing are recommended to ensure robustness and performance.
