Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical autonomous system) empireâ€™s self-evolving autonomy stack involves incorporating recursive strategies that allow for self-improvement, adaptability, and resilience. Below is a high-level design explaining the architecture and functionality of such a Python module, featuring innovative recursive strategies:

### Module Name: `SelfEvolver`

#### Key Features:
1. **Recursive Self-Improvement**: Implement algorithms that allow the module to improve its own code and strategy over time.
2. **Adaptive Learning**: Employ machine learning techniques to adapt to changing environments and requirements.
3. **Feedback Loop Optimization**: Develop a continuous feedback loop to optimize performance through data-driven insights.
4. **Modular Design**: Easy integration with other components of PTM.
5. **Robust Error Handling and Recovery**: Ensure resilience in unpredictable scenarios.

#### Core Components:

1. **Recursive Self-Improvement Engine (RSIE)**:
   - **Functionality**: Uses genetic programming and reinforcement learning to iteratively improve its own algorithms.
   - **Algorithm**:
     - Evaluate current algorithm performance.
     - Identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
     - Generate variations of the current algorithms using genetic programming.
     - Use a scoring system to evaluate new variations based on defined performance metrics.
     - Implement variations that provide improved performance.

2. **Adaptive Learning Module (ALM)**:
   - **Functionality**: Continuously learns and adapts based on new data inputs from the environment.
   - **Algorithm**: 
     - Leverage techniques like online learning and transfer learning.
     - Update models incrementally to maintain accuracy and efficiency.
     - Integrate sensor data and event logs to dynamically adjust to new contexts.

3. **Feedback Loop System (FLS)**:
   - **Functionality**: Provides real-time metrics and analytics to guide the RSIE and ALM.
   - **Algorithm**:
     - Collect data from all interactions and decision points.
     - Use statistical models to derive insights into system performance.
     - Feed these insights back into RSIE and ALM to guide future modifications and learning processes.

4. **Modular Interface and API (MIA)**:
   - **Functionality**: Facilitates communication between the SelfEvolver module and other components of the autonomy stack.
   - **Features**:
     - Standardized API calls for integration.
     - Support for custom extensions and plugins to enhance functionality.

5. **Resilience and Error Recovery Unit (RERU)**:
   - **Functionality**: Handles exceptions and ensures system can recover from failures.
   - **Strategy**:
     - Monitor for anomalies and deviations from expected behavior.
     - Implement a checkpoint system to rollback to stable states when exceptions occur.
     - Utilize predictive analysis to prevent failures by detecting early warning signs.

#### Implementation Example

Here's a simplified example of how one might start implementing the RSIE component in Python:

```python
import random
import numpy as np

class SelfEvolver:
    def __init__(self, algorithm):
        self.algorithm = algorithm
        self.population_size = 100
        self.generations = 10
        self.mutation_rate = 0.1

    def evolve_algorithm(self, data):
        current_population = [self.algorithm for _ in range(self.population_size)]
        for generation in range(self.generations):
            # Evaluate and sort by performance
            scores = [(algo, self.evaluate_algo(algo, data)) for algo in current_population]
            scores.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
            
            # Select top performers
            top_performers = scores[:self.population_size // 2]
            parents = [x[0] for x in top_performers]
            
            # Create new generation through crossover and mutation
            new_population = self.crossover_and_mutate(parents)
            current_population = new_population
        
        # Return the best evolved algorithm
        return max(scores, key=lambda x: x[1])[0]

    def evaluate_algo(self, algorithm, data):
        # Dummy evaluation function
        performance = sum(algorithm(data))
        noise = np.random.normal(0, 1)
        return performance + noise

    def crossover_and_mutate(self, parents):
        new_population = []
        while len(new_population) < self.population_size:
            # Crossover
            parent1, parent2 = random.sample(parents, 2)
            child = self.crossover(parent1, parent2)
            
            # Mutation
            if random.random() < self.mutation_rate:
                self.mutate(child)
            
            new_population.append(child)
        
        return new_population

    def crossover(self, parent1, parent2):
        # Simple crossover logic
        return (np.array(parent1) + np.array(parent2)) // 2

    def mutate(self, algorithm):
        # Simple mutation logic
        algorithm += np.random.normal(0, 1, size=algorithm.shape)

# Example usage
initial_algorithm = np.random.rand(10)
selv = SelfEvolver(initial_algorithm)
best_algorithm = selv.evolve_algorithm(np.random.rand(100, 10))
```

#### Conclusion

The `SelfEvolver` module establishes a young, recursive platform that pushes the PTM autonomy stack toward self-evolving capabilities. Although simplified, this outlines the survey of recursive self-improvement and adaptability, emphasizing a modular and resilient design. Future iterations should focus on enhancing complexity with more sophisticated AI techniques and real-world integration testing.
