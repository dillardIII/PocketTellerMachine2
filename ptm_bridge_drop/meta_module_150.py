Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably referring to a hypothetical autonomous system) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires addressing key aspects like learning, decision-making, adaptation, and recursive improvement. Below is a conceptual outline of a Python module that emphasizes these features through a recursive strategy approach:

```python
# ptm_self_evolver.py

import copy
import logging
import random

class PTMCoreUnit:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_base=None, decision_layers=None):
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base if knowledge_base else {}
        self.decision_layers = decision_layers if decision_layers else []

    def update_knowledge(self, info):
        # Update the knowledge base with new information
        for key, value in info.items():
            if key not in self.knowledge_base:
                self.knowledge_base[key] = value
            else:
                self.recursive_update(self.knowledge_base[key], value)

    def recursive_update(self, current_level, new_info):
        # Recursively update the structure for nested information
        if isinstance(current_level, dict) and isinstance(new_info, dict):
            for key, value in new_info.items():
                if key in current_level:
                    self.recursive_update(current_level[key], value)
                else:
                    current_level[key] = value
        else:
            current_level = new_info

    def add_decision_layer(self, layer):
        self.decision_layers.append(layer)

    def make_decision(self):
        # Execute decisions through layer processing
        context = copy.deepcopy(self.knowledge_base)
        for layer in self.decision_layers:
            context = layer.process(context)
            if context.get('terminate'):
                break
        return context

class DecisionLayer:
    def __init__(self, name, process_function):
        self.name = name
        self.process_function = process_function

    def process(self, context):
        # Define the processing logic for this layer
        logging.info(f"Processing layer: {self.name}")
        return self.process_function(context)

# Example process function
def learning_layer_processing(context):
    # Simulate learning and improvement strategy
    new_information = {"insights": random.choice(["improvement", "maintenance"])}
    context.update(new_information)
    context['terminate'] = context['insights'] == 'improvement'
    return context

def decision_making_layer_processing(context):
    # Simulate making complex decisions based on the current context
    decision = "move_forward" if context.get('insights') != "blocker" else "reassess"
    context['decision'] = decision
    return context

# Initialize PTM system
ptm_system = PTMCoreUnit()

# Populate decision layers
learning_layer = DecisionLayer("Learning Layer", learning_layer_processing)
decision_layer = DecisionLayer("Decision-Making Layer", decision_making_layer_processing)

ptm_system.add_decision_layer(learning_layer)
ptm_system.add_decision_layer(decision_layer)

# Update knowledge base with a simulated information update
ptm_system.update_knowledge({"environment": {"weather": "clear", "traffic": "high"}})

# Make a decision based on updated knowledge and decision layers
decision_context = ptm_system.make_decision()

# Output result
print("Final Decision Context:", decision_context)
```

### Key Features:
1. **Recursive Knowledge Update**: Utilizes recursion to update nested structures within the knowledge base, allowing the system to handle complex, layered data inputs.

2. **Layered Decision Processing**: Implements multiple decision layers, each designed to apply a specific function or strategy for processing the input context.

3. **Adaptive Decision Loop**: Involves a recursive-like decision loop using decision layers to iteratively refine decisions until reaching a termination condition.

4. **Expandability**: Easily add new decision layers or strategies to enhance adaptability and refine the decision-making process.

5. **Innovative Learning Integration**: Shows the potential for integrating other AI and machine learning techniques to further support adaptability by expanding the `learning_layer_processing` function.

This module serves as a foundational idea for constructing more advanced autonomous systems that can self-evolve by recursively refining their decision processes. It can be expanded with more sophisticated AI algorithms and integrated into broader ecosystems to enhance the PTM empire's capabilities.
