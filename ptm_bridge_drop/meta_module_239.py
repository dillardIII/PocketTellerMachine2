Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a Placeholder Technology Moniker) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating components that enhance the system's ability to autonomously improve and adapt over time. This design will heavily leverage concepts of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and recursive strategies to ensure continuous self-improvement and adaptation.

To achieve this, we can break down the module into several key components:

1. **Self-Monitoring**: Establish a system that continually evaluates the performance of the autonomy stack, identifying areas for improvement.

2. **Learning and Adaptation**: Implement machine learning techniques that allow the system to learn from new data and adapt its behavior.

3. **Recursive Optimization**: Enable recursive strategies that allow the system to revisit and refine previous decisions and models.

4. **Integration and Collaboration**: Ensure the module can seamlessly integrate and collaborate with existing components of the PTM stack.

Below is a conceptual design and Python code implementing a simplified version of such a module:

```python
# ptm_self_evolving_module.py

import logging
from typing import Any, Callable
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator
import numpy as np

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class SelfEvolvingAutonomy:
    def __init__(self, evaluator: Callable[[Any], float], model: BaseEstimator):
        """
        :param evaluator: Function to evaluate the model's performance.
        :param model: A machine learning model that can be trained on new data.
        """
        self.evaluator = evaluator
        self.model = model
        self.performance_log = []

    def monitor_and_learn(self, X_new: np.ndarray, y_new: np.ndarray, recurse_depth: int = 3):
        """
        Monitors performance and triggers learning/adaptation process.
        :param X_new: New input data for model evaluation and learning.
        :param y_new: New target data for model evaluation and learning.
        :param recurse_depth: Depth of recursive optimization allowed.
        """
        initial_score = self.evaluate(X_new, y_new)
        logging.info(f"Initial Model Score: {initial_score}")

        for depth in range(recurse_depth):
            self.model.fit(X_new, y_new)  # Update model with new data
            new_score = self.evaluate(X_new, y_new)
            self.performance_log.append(new_score)

            logging.info(f"Model Score at Depth {depth + 1}: {new_score}")

            if new_score <= initial_score:
                # If there's no improvement, break to avoid unnecessary computations
                logging.info("No improvement found, stopping recursion.")
                break
            initial_score = new_score

    def evaluate(self, X: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> float:
        """
        Evaluates the current model's performance.
        :param X: Input data.
        :param y: True labels.
        :return: Performance score.
        """
        predictions = self.model.predict(X)
        score = self.evaluator(y, predictions)
        return score

# Example usage:

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Synthetic data
X_initial = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_initial = np.random.rand(100)

# Create the self-evolving system
evolver = SelfEvolvingAutonomy(evaluator=mean_squared_error, model=LinearRegression())

# Simulated new incoming data
X_new = np.random.rand(20, 10)
y_new = np.random.rand(20)

# Run monitoring and learning procedure
evolver.monitor_and_learn(X_new, y_new)
```

### Key Concepts:

- **Self-Monitoring**: Uses a performance evaluation function to continually assess the model.
  
- **Learning and Adaptation**: Integrates new data to refine the model's predictive capabilities.

- **Recursive Optimization**: The `monitor_and_learn` method executes recursive updates, re-evaluating performance after each step until no further improvements are detected.

- **Dynamic and Modular**: Designed for flexibility to plug in different types of models and evaluators, encouraging experimentation and customization.

### Future Enhancements:

- **Advanced Learning Techniques**: Implement deep learning approaches for more complex tasks.

- **Automated Feature Engineering**: Use recursive feature engineering to discover and select key features automatically.

- **Continuous Deployment and Integration**: Develop a pipeline for deploying updates to the autonomy stack with minimal downtime.

This module forms the core component for evolving the PTM autonomy stack by embedding adaptability and recursive decision-making to foster a self-improving system.
