Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "Prometheus Thematic Mind" or any other relevant name fitting your context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves several fundamental aspects. The key is to incorporate innovative recursive strategies that allow the system to self-optimize, learn iteratively, and adapt to new scenarios without external input. Here's a high-level overview and preliminary design of such a system module.

### High-Level Architecture

1. **Recursive Learning Component**: This component focuses on learning from prior outcomes and iteratively optimizing itself. It employs techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) with recursive loops to improve decision-making capabilities.

2. **Dynamic Neural Network Management**: A neural network that can expand or contract its neurons and layers based on the input data complexity is essential. Techniques like neural architecture search (NAS) and dynamic model pruning can be integrated.

3. **Feedback Mechanism**: Embedding feedback loops to ensure the system can evaluate its performance in real-time, providing data for recursive learning.

4. **Autonomous Decision Engine**: Incorporating a decision-making logic system that improves itself through recursive strategies like Monte Carlo Tree Search or AlphaZero-like approaches.

### Sample Module Design

Below is a conceptual design of a Python module. This is a simplified version and would need to be further developed and validated for practical use:

```python
import numpy as np
from neural_network import DynamicNeuralNetwork
from rl_agent import ReinforcementLearningAgent
from feedback import FeedbackLoop
from decision import DecisionEngine

class SelfEvolvingAutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.neural_network = DynamicNeuralNetwork()
        self.rl_agent = ReinforcementLearningAgent()
        self.feedback_loop = FeedbackLoop()
        self.decision_engine = DecisionEngine()

    def recursive_learning(self, input_data):
        """
        Performs successively improved predictions by recursively updating the model.
        """
        predictions = self.decision_engine.make_decision(input_data)
        feedback = self.feedback_loop.collect_feedback(predictions)
        self.rl_agent.update_policy(feedback)

        # Integrate feedback to evolve network
        updated_model = self.neural_network.adapt_structure(feedback)
        
        return updated_model.predict(input_data)
    
    def evolve_autonomously(self, data_stream):
        """
        Main function to evolve autonomously and handle the input data stream.
        """
        for data in data_stream:
            self.recursive_learning(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example data stream, in a real-world scenario, this would be input data for the model to learn from
    example_data_stream = np.random.rand(100, 10) # Dummy data
    
    stack = SelfEvolvingAutonomyStack()
    stack.evolve_autonomously(example_data_stream)
```

### Key Considerations:

1. **Dynamic Neural Network**: Implement a neural network that adjusts its architecture based on input data. This is crucial for handling varying complexities dynamically.

2. **Recursive Learning**: Employ RL techniques like Q-learning or PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) with modifications to continuously refine the agentâ€™s policies.

3. **Continuous Feedback**: Real-time feedback collection is necessary to ensure the model learns from both successes and failures.

4. **Privacy and Security**: Ensure the system is designed with data security and privacy regulations in mind.

5. **Scalability**: Ensure the module can be easily scaled to accommodate exponential growth in data and computational demands.

Further development would involve refining each component, rigorous testing, and integration with existing systems to create a seamless self-evolving autonomous system.
