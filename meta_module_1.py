Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical autonomous empire) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves several components. The module should leverage recursive strategies, machine learning, and potentially evolutionary algorithms to enable a system that evolves and adapts over time. Here's a high-level outline of how such a module could be designed:

### Module Overview

The module, named `autonomy_stack`, will have several interconnected components:

1. **Core Engine**: Drives the recursive strategies and evolutionary processes.
2. **Machine Learning Models**: For pattern recognition, decision making, and prediction.
3. **Evolutionary Algorithm Framework**: To simulate evolution and adaptation.
4. **Self-Assessment and Optimization Tools**: Evaluates the performance and optimizes the strategies.
5. **Multi-Agent System**: For distributed decision-making.
6. **Integration Layer**: Ensures seamless communication with existing systems.

### Detailed Design

#### 1. Core Engine

The core engine is responsible for orchestrating all components of the module.

```python
class CoreEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = []
        self.evolutionary_algorithm = EvolutionaryAlgorithm()
    
    def add_agent(self, agent):
        self.agents.append(agent)

    def run(self):
        for agent in self.agents:
            agent.execute()
        self.evolutionary_algorithm.evolve(self.agents)
```

#### 2. Machine Learning Models

This will use various models, such as neural networks, decision trees, and reinforcement learning agents.

```python
class MachineLearningModel:
    def __init__(self, model_type='neural_network'):
        self.model_type = model_type
        # Initialize model based on type
        # ......

    def train(self, data):
        # Train model with data
        pass

    def predict(self, input_data):
        # Predict outcomes with trained model
        pass
```

#### 3. Evolutionary Algorithm Framework

Framework for implementing genetic algorithms or other evolutionary strategies.

```python
class EvolutionaryAlgorithm:
    def evolve(self, population):
        # Apply selection, crossover, mutation
        pass

    def select(self, population):
        # Selection strategy
        pass

    def crossover(self, parent1, parent2):
        # Crossover strategy
        pass

    def mutate(self, individual):
        # Mutation strategy
        pass
```

#### 4. Self-Assessment and Optimization Tools

These tools evaluate the effectiveness of strategies and suggest improvements.

```python
class SelfAssessment:
    def __init__(self, metrics):
        self.metrics = metrics

    def assess(self, agent):
        # Evaluate agent performance
        pass

    def optimize(self, agents):
        # Suggest optimizations
        pass
```

#### 5. Multi-Agent System

Facilitates decentralized decision-making and action execution.

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, id, strategy):
        self.id = id
        self.strategy = strategy

    def execute(self):
        # Execute agent strategy
        pass

    def adapt(self):
        # Adaptation logic based on environment
        pass
```

#### 6. Integration Layer

This component will ensure that the new autonomy stack works seamlessly with existing systems.

```python
class IntegrationLayer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.external_systems = []

    def integrate(self, system):
        self.external_systems.append(system)

    def communicate(self, data):
        # Communication logic with external systems
        pass
```

### Recursive Strategies

Within this module, recursive strategies can be employed for self-improvement. For instance, each agent could recursively analyze its own performance and adjust its strategies accordingly:

```python
class RecursiveStrategy:
    def __init__(self, agent):
        self.agent = agent

    def analyze_and_adapt(self):
        performance = self.agent.execute()
        if not self.is_optimal(performance):
            self.agent.adapt()
            self.analyze_and_adapt()

    def is_optimal(self, performance):
        # Determine if the performance is optimal:
        return performance >= threshold
```

### Conclusion

This outline sketches a flexible and extensible Python module designed to empower PTM's evolving autonomy stack. Each component serves a critical role, ensuring the system can adapt and improve autonomously over time. The integration of recursive strategies ensures continuous self-improvement, making the system robust and forward-adaptive.
