Creating a new Python module to expand PTM (Presumably a technological company) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires careful planning, innovation, and integration of recursive strategies. Below, I'll provide a basic outline and example code for such a module. Note that autonomy in this context suggests the module should aid in automating or improving self-management abilities in software systems.

### Module Overview: `autonomy_stack`

This module aims to facilitate a self-evolving system by utilizing recursive strategies to learn and adapt over time. It includes features like dynamic decision making, context pooling, feedback loops, and adaptive learning algorithms.

### Key Components:
1. **Contextual Awareness**: Understanding and managing contextual information to make informed decisions.
2. **Recursive Learning**: Utilizing learned experiences to improve system performance.
3. **Feedback Loop Mechanism**: Continuously assessing outcomes and incorporating feedback for constant improvement.
4. **Decision Frameworks**: Employ decision trees and optimization algorithms to enhance automated decision-making.

### Core Functionality

Here's a skeleton of what the Python module might look like:

```python
# autonomy_stack.py

import random
import json

class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.context_pool = {}
        self.feedback_history = []

    def add_context(self, context_key, context_value):
        """ Adds new context information to the context pool """
        self.context_pool[context_key] = context_value

    def decision_matrix(self):
        """ Simulates a decision process based on available contexts """
        decision_factors = self._find_relevant_factors()
        decision = self._recursive_decision(decision_factors)
        return decision

    def _find_relevant_factors(self):
        """ Finds and returns relevant factors from context pool """
        # Imagine some sophisticated filtering logic
        return [(key, self.context_pool[key]) for key in self.context_pool]

    def _recursive_decision(self, decision_factors):
        """ A recursive strategy to make decisions based on factors """
        if not decision_factors:
            # base case of recursion, default choice
            return random.choice(["default_action1", "default_action2"])

        # Recursive case to explore decision factors
        key, value = decision_factors.pop()

        # For demonstration, some arbitrary recursion logic
        if random.random() > 0.5:  # condition to simulate branching:
            return self._recursive_decision(decision_factors)

        return f"action_based_on_{key}"

    def incorporate_feedback(self, decision, outcome):
        """ Incorporates feedback from previous decisions """
        feedback = {"decision": decision, "outcome": outcome}
        self.feedback_history.append(feedback)

        # Update context with feedback to improve future decisions
        success_metric = self.evaluate_outcome(outcome)
        if success_metric > 0.5:
            self.context_pool[f"{decision}_success"] = success_metric

    def evaluate_outcome(self, outcome):
        """ Placeholder outcome evaluation logic """
        # Normally, this would be more complex with machine learning for predictive success
        return random.random()  # simplifying for demonstration

# usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    stack = AutonomyStack()
    stack.add_context("sensor_value", 12)
    stack.add_context("user_input", "positive_feedback")

    decision = stack.decision_matrix()
    print("Decision made:", decision)

    stack.incorporate_feedback(decision, {"achievement": "goal_met"})

    with open("feedback_history.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(stack.feedback_history, f, indent=4)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Contextual Awareness**: The class maintains a `context_pool` dictionary to store contextual data.
2. **Recursive Learning**: The `_recursive_decision` method uses recursive strategy to explore decisions based on context.
3. **Feedback Loop**: `incorporate_feedback` method updates the context pool with insights derived from evaluating past outcomes, promoting a loop of learning and adaptation.
4. **Decision Frameworks**: Uses a combination of random choices and recursion to simulate decision paths improving with context augmentation.

### Innovation and Expansion
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Incorporate advanced machine learning models to predict outcomes more effectively.
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Improve the feedback loop to incorporate real-time adaptation based on evolving contexts.
- **Complex Decision Trees**: Expand recursive logic with more sophisticated decision trees and probabilistic models.

This module outlines the architecture and basic operations needed for building a self-evolving autonomy stack using recursive strategies. While this is just a prototype, it can serve as a foundation for further development and innovation in automated systems.
