Creating a new strategy or empire utility in Python can be quite engaging. One idea is to create a resource management tool for a hypothetical strategy game. This utility will help players optimize their empire's resource allocation to maximize productivity and efficiency. We'll focus on key resources like food, gold, and labor, and incorporate a simple algorithm to recommend optimal allocation.

Below is a Python script for such a utility:

```python
class EmpireResourceOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, food_production, gold_production, labor_force):
        """
        Initialize the resource optimizer with the given resources.
        
        :param food_production: Available units of food produced per cycle.
        :param gold_production: Available units of gold produced per cycle.
        :param labor_force: Available units of labor force.
        """
        self.food_production = food_production
        self.gold_production = gold_production
        self.labor_force = labor_force

    def optimize_resources(self):
        # Basic ratios just for creating different strategies, adjust as needed.
        food_labor_ratio = 0.4
        gold_labor_ratio = 0.4
        reserve_labor_ratio = 0.2

        food_workers = int(self.labor_force * food_labor_ratio)
        gold_workers = int(self.labor_force * gold_labor_ratio)
        reserve_workers = int(self.labor_force * reserve_labor_ratio)

        food_yield = self.food_production * (food_workers / max(1, self.labor_force))
        gold_yield = self.gold_production * (gold_workers / max(1, self.labor_force))

        return {
            "food_workers": food_workers,
            "gold_workers": gold_workers,
            "reserve_workers": reserve_workers,
            "food_yield": food_yield,
            "gold_yield": gold_yield
        }

    def display_recommendations(self):
        recommendations = self.optimize_resources()
        print("Resource Allocation Strategy:")
        print(f"- Assign {recommendations['food_workers']} workers to food production.")
        print(f"- Assign {recommendations['gold_workers']} workers to gold production.")
        print(f"- Keep {recommendations['reserve_workers']} workers as reserve.")
        print(f"- Estimated Food Yield: {recommendations['food_yield']} units.")
        print(f"- Estimated Gold Yield: {recommendations['gold_yield']} units.")

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example input parameters: 100 units of each resource/production power.
    food_production = 100
    gold_production = 100
    labor_force = 100

    optimizer = EmpireResourceOptimizer(food_production, gold_production, labor_force)
    optimizer.display_recommendations()
```

### How It Works:
1. **Initialization:** The `EmpireResourceOptimizer` class takes three key inputs:
   - `food_production`: The capacity of food that can be produced.
   - `gold_production`: The capacity of gold that can be produced.
   - `labor_force`: Total available workforce.

2. **Resource Optimization:** The `optimize_resources` method calculates how to distribute the labor force among food production, gold production, and reserve (for future flexibility or new tasks).

3. **Display Recommendations:** The `display_recommendations` method outputs the optimal allocation strategy and potential yields of food and gold.

### Customization:
- The ratios for labor force allocation (`food_labor_ratio`, `gold_labor_ratio`, and `reserve_labor_ratio`) can be adjusted to reflect different strategic priorities.
- You could extend this utility to accommodate other resources or constraints, introduce more sophisticated algorithms (such as linear programming), or integrate it into a larger game framework.

This script offers a simple, expandable utility for managing resources effectively within a strategy or empire game context, and serves as a foundation for further development and customization.
