Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a flexible and adaptive system that can learn and optimize over time. The key is to incorporate recursive strategies that empower the system to improve iteratively. Below is a high-level design of such a module:

### Module: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Overview
The module will include the following components:
1. **Data Acquisition**: Collects and preprocesses data necessary for the module to make informed decisions.
2. **Self-Evolving Engine**: Implements recursive strategies that drive the system's evolution.
3. **Decision Making**: Algorithms designed to make autonomous decisions based on insights from data.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Mechanisms to integrate feedback for continuous learning and adaptation.
5. **Interface & API**: Provides an interface for interaction and integration with other modules.

#### Key Components

##### 1. Data Acquisition
This component gathers and preprocesses data from multiple sources to ensure that the autonomy stack has the most relevant information.

```python
class DataAcquisition:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_sources = []
    
    def add_source(self, source):
        self.data_sources.append(source)
    
    def acquire_data(self):
        # Simulate data acquisition from multiple sources
        data = []
        for source in self.data_sources:
            data.append(source.fetch_data())
        return self.preprocess_data(data)
    
    def preprocess_data(self, data):
        # Implement preprocessing steps (e.g., normalization, filtering)
        return [self._normalize(d) for d in data]
    
    def _normalize(self, data_point):
        # Placeholder normalization logic
        return (data_point - min(data_point)) / (max(data_point) - min(data_point))
```

##### 2. Self-Evolving Engine
Utilizes recursive strategies that enhance learning over time and improve decision-making capabilities.

```python
class SelfEvolvingEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = []
    
    def evolve(self, data):
        for model in self.models:
            model.train(data)
    
    def add_model(self, model):
        self.models.append(model)
    
    def recursive_strategy(self, depth):
        # Implement recursive evolution strategy
        if depth > 0:
            self.evolve(self.acquire_latest_data())
            self.recursive_strategy(depth - 1)
    
    def acquire_latest_data(self):
        # Placeholder method to simulate data acquisition
        return [DataAcquisition().acquire_data()]
```

##### 3. Decision Making
Makes informed decisions based on the current state and learned data.

```python
class DecisionMaker:
    def __init__(self, evolving_engine):
        self.engine = evolving_engine
    
    def make_decision(self, situation):
        # Use models to predict the best action
        scores = [model.predict(situation) for model in self.engine.models]
        return self._select_best_action(scores)
    
    def _select_best_action(self, scores):
        # Placeholder decision logic
        return scores.index(max(scores))
```

##### 4. Feedback Loop
Incorporates results and outcomes back into the system for self-improvement.

```python
class FeedbackLoop:
    def __init__(self, evolving_engine):
        self.engine = evolving_engine
    
    def process_feedback(self, results):
        # Implement feedback processing
        improved_data = self._analyze_results(results)
        self.engine.evolve(improved_data)
    
    def _analyze_results(self, results):
        # Placeholder feedback analysis logic
        return [result * 0.9 for result in results]
```

##### 5. Interface & API
An interface for integration and extension.

```python
class PTMAutonomyAPI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_acquisition = DataAcquisition()
        self.evolving_engine = SelfEvolvingEngine()
        self.decision_maker = DecisionMaker(self.evolving_engine)
        self.feedback_loop = FeedbackLoop(self.evolving_engine)

    def integrate_module(self, module):
        # Interface to add-in new modules or enhancements
        pass

    def run(self):
        # Central method to run the complete self-evolving cycle
        data = self.data_acquisition.acquire_data()
        self.evolving_engine.evolve(data)
        
        # Placeholder situation
        situation = None
        decision = self.decision_maker.make_decision(situation)
        
        # Simulate execution result
        results = self.execute_decision(decision)
        
        # Process feedback
        self.feedback_loop.process_feedback(results)
    
    def execute_decision(self, decision):
        # Placeholder for the execution of a decision
        return [1.0]  # Simulated result
```

### Conclusion
The `ptm_autonomy` module outlined above focuses on integrating recursive strategies for continual learning and improvement. Each component interacts closely, ensuring that data acquisition informs the self-evolution engine, which then drives the decision-making process while the feedback loop ensures adaptability. This design fosters a resilient and adaptive autonomy stack capable of handling the dynamic environments often encountered in real-world applications.
