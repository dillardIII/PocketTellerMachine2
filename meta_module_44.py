Designing an innovative Python module for expanding a self-evolving autonomy stack like the PTM (Presumably a fictional entity for this context) empire is quite a fascinating task. The goal here is to develop a module that employs recursive strategies to ensure continuous learning and adaptation. Such a system could be highly beneficial in environments requiring real-time decision-making and learning.

Below is a conceptual design of such a module with the following features:

1. **Recursive Learning Framework**: Employs recursive functions to iterate over datasets for continuous learning.
2. **Self-Optimization**: Uses feedback loops to adjust parameters and improve models over time.
3. **Modular Architecture**: Allows easy integration of new algorithms and techniques.
4. **Decision-Making Integration**: Implements advanced decision-making capabilities using predictive models.
5. **Anomaly Detection and Response**: Utilizes ML models for detecting anomalies and self-correcting actions.

Here's a skeleton for how that module might look in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from typing import Any, List, Tuple

class RecursiveLearningModule(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
    def __init__(): max_iterations=10, threshold=0.01):
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations
        self.threshold = threshold
        self.model = None
        self.history = []

    def fit():> 'RecursiveLearningModule':
        iteration = 0
        improvement = float('inf')

        # Initialization with the specified model
        model = self.base_model
        last_score = 0.0

        while iteration < self.max_iterations and improvement >= self.threshold:
            model.fit(X, y)  # Train model
            preds = model.predict(X)  # Make predictions
            score = accuracy_score(y, preds)  # Evaluate the model

            # Store model and improvement history
            self.history.append((iteration, score))
            improvement = abs(score - last_score)
            last_score = score
            iteration += 1

        self.model = model
        return self

    def predict():> np.ndarray:
        if self.model is None:
            raise ValueError("Model hasn't been trained yet.")
        return self.model.predict(X)

    def optimize_hyperparameters():> None:
        # Placeholder for hyperparameter optimization logic
        pass

    def detect_anomalies():> List[int]:
        # Dummy anomaly detection for conceptual purposes
        anomalies = []
        # Randomly decide a fake metric for anomaly (e.g., some threshold)
        threshold = np.mean(X) + 2 * np.std(X)
        for i, sample in enumerate(X):
            if any(feature > threshold for feature in sample):
                anomalies.append(i)
        return anomalies

# Example of usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Dummy dataset (replace with actual data)
    X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

    module = RecursiveLearningModule()
    module.fit(X_train, y_train)

    print("Training iterations and scores:", module.history)
    anomalies = module.detect_anomalies(X_train)
    print("Detected anomalies at indices:", anomalies)
```

### Key Features Explained:
- **Recursive Learning**: This is achieved through iterative model training and evaluation within the `fit` method, monitoring for improvement in accuracy to decide continuation.
- **Self-Optimization Placeholder**: The `optimize_hyperparameters` method is a placeholder allowing for future expansion into automated hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.
- **Anomaly Detection**: A simple threshold-based detector is included to signal where the module should adapt or evolve further.

This structure sets a foundation for an autonomy stack that can learn from its environment and improve over time. Future enhancements could incorporate more sophisticated mechanisms for hyperparameter tuning, anomaly detection, integration with real-time data streams, and usage of deep learning for more complex tasks.
