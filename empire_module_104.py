Creating an advanced Python module utilizing intelligent recursion involves implementing a structure that can handle complex recursive tasks efficiently. While designing such a module, we should think about scenarios where recursion might otherwise lead to inefficiencies, such as excessive stack use or redundant calculations, and incorporate strategies to mitigate these issues, like memoization or iterative deepening.

Below, I will outline a basic structure for a Python module called `intelligent_recursion`, which showcases intelligent recursion in solving problems that might benefit from it. This module will include an example of a recursive implementation, with memoization, to find Fibonacci numbers.

```python
# intelligent_recursion.py

class IntelligentRecursion:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initializing a memoization dictionary
        self.memo = {}

    def fibonacci(self, n):
        """
        Computes the n-th Fibonacci number using intelligent recursion
        with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
        
        :param n: Index of the Fibonacci sequence to compute
        :return: The n-th Fibonacci number
        """
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Negative arguments are not supported")
        if n in {0, 1}:
            return n

        # Check if the result is already memoized
        if n not in self.memo:
            # Apply recursive definition and store the result in memo
            self.memo[n] = self.fibonacci(n - 1) + self.fibonacci(n - 2)
        
        return self.memo[n]

    def factorial(self, n):
        """
        Computes the factorial of n using intelligent recursion,
        illustrating tail call optimization techniques by leveraging
        Python's dynamic capabilities.

        :param n: The number to compute the factorial of
        :return: n!
        """
        return self._factorial_helper(n, 1)

    def _factorial_helper(self, n, accumulator):
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Negative arguments are not supported")
        if n in {0, 1}:
            return accumulator

        return self._factorial_helper(n - 1, accumulator * n)

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    recurse_obj = IntelligentRecursion()
    
    # Calculate Fibonacci numbers
    fib_number = recurse_obj.fibonacci(10)
    print(f"10th Fibonacci number is: {fib_number}")

    # Calculate Factorial
    fact_number = recurse_obj.factorial(5)
    print(f"Factorial of 5 is: {fact_number}")
```

### Key Features:

1. **Memoization**: The `fibonacci` method uses a dictionary to cache previously computed Fibonacci numbers, effectively improving performance and preventing redundant calculations.

2. **Tail Call Optimization (TCO)**: While Python does not natively support TCO due to its stack trace preservation feature, the `factorial` method is optimized to use an accumulator, simulating TCO by reducing the depth of recursion.

3. **Error Handling**: The module includes basic error handling to ensure that negative indices or invalid inputs are managed correctly.

### Further Considerations:

- **Performance Metrics**: This module could be expanded with profiling tools to assess the performance of recursive solutions dynamically and adaptively choose a strategy (e.g., switching to iterative solutions for very deep recursion).

- **Concurrency**: Explore the possibility of introducing asynchronous recursion or using concurrent futures for tasks that can be parallelized.

This module provides a foundation for extending its functionality to other recursive problems, such as solving puzzles, navigating data structures, or dynamic programming challenges.
