Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "Prime Technology Module" or other context-specific abbreviation) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system capable of self-improvement and adaptation. Recursive strategies can be a powerful approach to implementing self-evolving characteristics. Here is a conceptual design for such a module:

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Overview

The `ptm_autonomy` module is designed to enhance the self-evolving capabilities of the PTM empire’s autonomy stack. The module incorporates recursive strategies and machine learning paradigms to facilitate continuous improvement in decision-making, adaptability, and performance.

#### Key Features

1. **Recursive Learning Framework**: 
   - Implements self-referential models that iterate over data to improve prediction correctness and decision quality.
   - Allows continuous recalibration through recursive feedback loops.

2. **Self-Optimization Engine**:
   - Employs genetic algorithms and evolutionary strategies to iteratively enhance algorithms and system parameters for optimal performance.
   - Includes automated hyperparameter tuning.

3. **Distributed Learning Nodes**:
   - Divides learning tasks among distributed agents to ensure scalability and fault tolerance.
   - Uses federated learning techniques to aggregate improvements without centralizing data.

4. **Recursive Planning Module**:
   - A planning system that utilizes recursive decomposition of tasks and goals to achieve high-level objectives.
   - Implements task-specific planners that operate on recursive reward structures.

5. **Anomaly Detection and Correction**:
   - Integrates anomaly detection using unsupervised learning to identify and autonomously correct abnormal behavior.
   - Utilizes recursive filtering to refine anomaly detection over time.

#### Core Classes and Methods

```python
# Module: ptm_autonomy

class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        self.history = []

    def iterative_train(self, data):
        """
        Performs recursive learning over provided data.
        """
        for _ in range(NUM_ITERATIONS):
            predictions = self.model.predict(data)
            self.model.update(predictions)
            self.history.append(predictions)
        return self.model

class SelfOptimizer:
    def optimize(self, function, initial_params):
        """
        Applies evolutionary strategies to find the optimal parameters.
        """
        # Implement genetic algorithm or other optimization strategy
        raise NotImplementedError

class DistributedNode:
    def __init__(self, data, learner):
        self.data = data
        self.learner = learner

    def perform_learning(self):
        """
        Runs learning on the node's data.
        """
        self.learner.iterative_train(self.data)

class RecursivePlanner:
    def recursive_plan(self, goals):
        """
        Decomposes and recursively plans tasks for goal achievement.
        """
        plans = []
        for goal in goals:
            subplan = self.create_subplan(goal)
            plans.append(self.recursive_plan(subplan))
        return plans

    def create_subplan(self, goal):
        # Decomposes a goal into sub-goals
        raise NotImplementedError

class AnomalyDetector:
    def detect_anomalies(self, data, threshold):
        """
        Detects and adjusts for anomalies.
        """
        # Implement anomaly detection logic
        raise NotImplementedError
```

### Implementation Steps

1. **Integration with Existing Autonomy Systems**: 
   - Ensure compatibility with current PTM architectures.
   - Develop adapters and interfaces for seamless data flow.

2. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Implement a robust testing framework to validate recursive learning and optimization performance.
   - Use synthetic and real-world datasets to assess module effectiveness.

3. **Iterative Development**: 
   - Employ agile methods to continually develop and improve upon module capabilities based on user feedback and experimental results.
   - Foster a community or team collaboration for ideas and innovation.

4. **Security and Ethical Considerations**:
   - Incorporate measures for data security and user privacy.
   - Evaluate the ethical implications of self-evolving systems.

This design focuses on leveraging recursive strategies inherently adaptable to change, fostering a system that grows smarter and more efficient over time within the PTM empire's operational framework.
