Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "Parent-Teacher Meeting," although contextually, it might mean something different) empireâ€™s self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating an innovative system that leverages recursive strategies to process data, make decisions, and adapt over time. Here is a conceptual outline of such a module:

```python
# empire_autonomy.py

import logging
from typing import Any, Callable, List

class SelfEvolvingStack:
    def __init__(self, initial_state: Any, evolution_strategy: Callable[[Any], Any]):
        """
        Initializes the autonomy stack with an initial state and an evolution strategy.

        :param initial_state: The starting point of the system's knowledge or state.
        :param evolution_strategy: A callable that updates the state based on recursive strategies.
        """
        self.state = initial_state
        self.evolution_strategy = evolution_strategy
        self.history = [initial_state]
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

    def evolve():> None:
        """
        Applies the evolution strategy recursively to evolve the system's state.
        """
        logging.info(f"Current State: {self.state}")
        new_state = self.evolution_strategy(self.state)
        self.state = new_state
        self.history.append(new_state)
        logging.info(f"Evolved to State: {new_state}")

    def recursive_thinking():> Any:
        """
        Simulates recursive thinking by evolving the state a specific number of times.

        :param depth: Number of recursive evolutions to perform.
        :return: Final state after recursive processing.
        """
        for _ in range(depth):
            self.evolve()
        return self.state

    def save_history():> None:
        """
        Saves the history of the state changes to a file for analysis.

        :param file_path: The path to the file where history will be saved.
        """
        with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
            for state in self.history:
                file.write(f"{state}\n")
        logging.info(f"History successfully saved to {file_path}")


# Evolution Strategies

def example_evolution_strategy():> Any:
    """
    An example of an evolution strategy that implements a simple recursive transformation.
    This could represent a machine learning model update, parameter tuning, etc.

    :param current_state: The current state of the system.
    :return: New updated state.
    """
    # Example recursive transformation: increment each element in a list
    if isinstance(current_state, list):
        return [x + 1 for x in current_state]
    # Add other recursive strategies based on actual use cases
    return current_state

# Usage Example

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initial state could be a data structure representing the system's initial knowledge
    initial_state = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

    autonomy_stack = SelfEvolvingStack(initial_state, example_evolution_strategy)
    
    # Simulate recursive thinking
    final_state = autonomy_stack.recursive_thinking(depth=5)
    
    # Save the history of states for review
    autonomy_stack.save_history("state_history.txt")
```

### Key Features:
1. **SelfEvolvingStack Class:** This is the core of the module, maintaining the system's state and managing its evolution.
2. **Evolution Strategy:** A callable strategy allows flexibility in defining how the state should evolve recursively. This could be enhanced with machine learning models or rules outlier detection.
3. **Recursive Thinking:** Simulates recursive processing, evolving the state a defined number of times.
4. **State History:** Tracks and saves changes in state over time, facilitating analysis of how the system has evolved.
5. **Extensibility:** The simple nature of the evolution strategy allows for easy adaptation and scaling with more complex strategies or integrations with AI/ML algorithms.

This module is a starting platform which can be expanded with sophisticated strategies involving recursive neural networks, reinforcement learning, or other AI techniques to create a fully autonomous self-improving system.
