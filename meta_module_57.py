Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably, an AI model similar to GPT) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack would involve architecting a system that can autonomously learn from its environment and improve its performance over time. Here's a conceptual overview of how you might design such a module. This would involve sophisticated techniques from machine learning, such as reinforcement learning, neural architecture search, and continual learning. Below is a high-level design along with some Python code to get started:

### Module Overview: PTMEvo

**Objectives:**
1. Self-Improvement: Enhance performance through continuous learning and environment interaction.
2. Adaptability: Adjust to new tasks and domains with minimal human intervention.
3. Scalability: Efficiently handle growing data and model complexity.

**Components:**
1. **Data Collector**: Gather data from interactions to fuel learning.
2. **Recursive Learner**: Implement recursive strategies for problem-solving and optimization.
3. **Neural Architecture Search**: Evolve model architectures.
4. **Knowledge Integrator**: Continuously integrate new knowledge without forgetting older ones.
5. **Performance Evaluator**: Assess improvements and guide learning focus.
6. **Autonomy Controller**: Manage execution flow and strategy selection.

### Recursive Strategies

1. **Recursive Optimization**: Recursive improvement of models and strategies using meta-learning techniques.
2. **Self-Reinforcing Feedback**: Implement loops where model outputs refine future model inputs and configurations.

### Example Python Code

Hereâ€™s a simplified sketch of what one part of this module might look like, focusing on a recursive learning strategy using reinforcement learning:

```python
import numpy as np
import gym

class PTMEvo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.environment = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
        self.agent = self.initialize_agent()
        self.performance_record = []

    def initialize_agent(self):
        # Placeholder for agent initialization
        return {
            'model': None,  # Replace with actual model
            'optimizer': None,  # Replace with optimizer
        }

    def recursive_learner(self, episodes=1000):
        for episode in range(episodes):
            state = self.environment.reset()
            done = False
            total_reward = 0

            while not done:
                action = self.select_action(state)
                next_state, reward, done, info = self.environment.step(action)
                total_reward += reward
                
                self.update_agent(state, action, reward, next_state, done)

                state = next_state

            self.performance_evaluator(total_reward, episode)

    def select_action(self, state):
        # Implement policy (e.g., epsilon-greedy)
        return self.environment.action_space.sample()

    def update_agent(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        # Implement learning update (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient)
        pass

    def performance_evaluator(self, total_reward, episode):
        # Record the performance
        self.performance_record.append(total_reward)
        if episode % 100 == 0:
            print(f"Episode {episode}: Total Reward: {total_reward}")

    def recursive_optimization(self):
        # Implement recursive optimization logic
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ptm_evo = PTMEvo()
    ptm_evo.recursive_learner()
```

### Innovative Features

1. **Data-Driven Evolution**: Design a mechanism to evolve model architectures based on performance data using neural architecture search.
   
2. **Knowledge Distillation**: Implement a strategy to transfer knowledge from older models to newer ones, ensuring knowledge retention.

3. **Autonomy Controller**: Design a system that decides, based on various metrics and thresholds, which learning strategies should be prioritized.

4. **Recursive Surrogate Models**: Develop surrogate models that can predict outcomes of actions and guide decision-making without fully executing in the real environment.

This blueprint(serves as a foundation. Expanding this into a full-fledged autonomy stack would require integrating more sophisticated techniques, handling real-world data, and ensuring ethical guidelines are maintained.)
