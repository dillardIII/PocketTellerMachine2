Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Predictive Task Management) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating recursive strategies that enhance its predictive capabilities, adaptability, and decision-making processes. Here's a conceptual breakdown of how such a module could be structured, focusing on innovation and recursive approaches:

### Module Overview

The module, named `self_evolver`, will serve as a plug-in to the PTM autonomy stack. Its core functions will include:

1. **Recursive Learning Framework**: Implementing recursive neural networks (RNNs) to process sequences of inputs and predict future states.
2. **Self-Optimization Algorithms**: Facilitating the module's ability to continuously improve through reinforcement learning (RL).
3. **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Enabling the module to autonomously adjust its strategies based on environmental feedback and historical performance.

### Key Components

#### 1. Recursive Learning Engine

Leverage RNNs for their ability to handle sequential data and learn temporal dynamics:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import SimpleRNN, Dense

class RecursiveLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self, input_shape, output_shape):
        self.model = Sequential([
            SimpleRNN(64, input_shape=input_shape, activation='relu', return_sequences=True),
            SimpleRNN(64, activation='relu'),
            Dense(output_shape, activation='softmax')
        ])
        self.model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['accuracy'])
    
    def train(self, x_train, y_train, epochs=10):
        self.model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=epochs, verbose=1)
    
    def predict(self, x_input):
        return self.model.predict(x_input)
```

#### 2. Self-Optimization Algorithms

Implement reinforcement learning to allow the module to learn optimal policies via exploration and exploitation:

```python
import random

class PolicyGradientAgent:
    def __init__(self, action_space):
        self.action_space = action_space
        self.policy = {action: 1.0/len(action_space) for action in action_space}
    
    def select_action(self):
        return random.choices(list(self.policy.keys()), weights=self.policy.values())[0]
    
    def update_policy(self, action, reward):
        self.policy[action] *= (1 + reward)  # Simple update for demonstration
        # Normalize after updating
        total = sum(self.policy.values())
        self.policy = {k: v/total for k, v in self.policy.items()}
```

#### 3. Adaptive Decision-Making

The module continuously adapts its strategies using feedback from its environment and outcomes of past decisions:

```python
class AdaptiveDecisionMaker:
    def __init__(self, rl_agent, learning_engine):
        self.rl_agent = rl_agent
        self.learning_engine = learning_engine
    
    def make_decision(self, state):
        state_prediction = self.learning_engine.predict(state)
        action = self.rl_agent.select_action()
        # Use state prediction to refine action (not implemented for brevity)
        return action
    
    def receive_feedback(self, reward, action):
        self.rl_agent.update_policy(action, reward)
```

### Integration and Execution

Integrate the module into the PTM stack and execute the decision-making loop:

```python
# Example setup and execution
input_shape = (10, 5)  # For instance, 10 time steps with 5 features each
output_shape = 3  # Number of possible outcomes or classes

learning_engine = RecursiveLearningEngine(input_shape, output_shape)
rl_agent = PolicyGradientAgent(action_space=['move', 'wait', 'explore'])
decision_maker = AdaptiveDecisionMaker(rl_agent, learning_engine)

# Simulated environment interaction loop
for episode in range(100):
    state = np.random.rand(*input_shape)  # Simulated state input
    action = decision_maker.make_decision(state)
    reward = np.random.choice([1, -1])  # Simulated reward
    decision_maker.receive_feedback(reward, action)
```

### Innovations and Improvements

- **Recursive Strategies**: Continuous learning and refinement of temporal patterns in input data.
- **Dynamic Policy Updates**: Policies evolve over time based on direct feedback from actions, using lightweight update mechanisms.
- **Feedback Loop**: Real-time adjustment and completion of tasks with adaptive strategies in diverse and unpredictable environments.

Overall, this Python module serves as an innovative extension of the PTM's autonomy stack, enhancing its capability to self-evolve and making it robust in dynamic scenarios. You may further customize this conceptual framework to fit specific needs or integrate more sophisticated algorithms according to domain requirements.
