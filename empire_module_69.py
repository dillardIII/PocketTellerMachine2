Creating a Python module with intelligent recursion for a hypothetical PTM empire requires us to understand what kind of advanced functionality we want this module to exhibit. For this exercise, let's imagine that PTM stands for "Processing, Transformation, and Manipulation" of dataâ€”a broad field that could cover a range of applications from AI data processing to complex database operations.

In this example, I'll outline an advanced Python module that uses intelligent recursion to solve a realistic problem, such as processing hierarchical data structures, which are common in many modern applications (like JSON-based APIs or DOM trees in web development). Intelligent recursion will entail optimizations like memoization to improve performance.

Let's call our module `ptm_recursive_processor`.

### Module Design

1. **Hierarchical Data Processor**: We'll develop a recursive function to process hierarchical (tree-like) data structures.

2. **Memoization**: Implement memoization to optimize recursive calls.

3. **Selective Processing**: Allow selective processing of nodes based on a user-defined condition.

### Code Implementation

```python
# ptm_recursive_processor.py

class RecursiveProcessor:
    def __init__(self, data):
        """Initialize with hierarchical data."""
        self.data = data
        # Initialize cache for memoization
        self.memo = {}

    def _process_node(self, node, condition_func, process_func):
        """Recursively process nodes, using condition_func to filter and process_func to process them."""
        
        # Check if the result is already in the cache
        node_id = id(node)
        if node_id in self.memo:
            return self.memo[node_id]

        # Process the node if it meets the condition
        if condition_func(node):
            processed_node = process_func(node)
        else:
            processed_node = node

        # Recurse over child nodes if any
        if isinstance(node, dict):
            for key, child in node.items():
                processed_node[key] = self._process_node(child, condition_func, process_func)
        elif isinstance(node, list):
            for index, child in enumerate(node):
                processed_node[index] = self._process_node(child, condition_func, process_func)

        # Store the result in the cache
        self.memo[node_id] = processed_node
        return processed_node

    def process(self, condition_func=lambda x: True, process_func=lambda x: x):
        """
        Process the data starting from the root, using provided functions to select
        and process nodes.

        - condition_func: A function to determine if a node should be processed.
        - process_func: A function to apply on each selected node.
        """
        return self._process_node(self.data, condition_func, process_func)

# Example usage of RecursiveProcessor
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Sample data: a simple tree structure
    sample_data = {
        "name": "root",
        "children": [
            {"name": "child1", "value": 1},
            {"name": "child2", "value": 2, "children": [
                {"name": "grandchild1", "value": 3}
            ]}
        ]
    }
    
    processor = RecursiveProcessor(sample_data)

    # Define a condition function: process only nodes with 'value' key
    condition_func = lambda node: isinstance(node, dict) and 'value' in node

    # Define a process function: increment value
    process_func = lambda node: {**node, 'value': node['value'] + 1}

    processed_data = processor.process(condition_func=condition_func, process_func=process_func)
    print(processed_data)
```

### Explanation

- **RecursiveProcessor Class**: Manages the entire processing, starting from initialization with hierarchical data.

- **Memoization**: Implemented using a dictionary (`self.memo`) to store already processed nodes, thus avoiding redundant processing.

- **Flexible Design**: Allows the user to specify how nodes should be processed (`process_func`) and which nodes should be processed (`condition_func`).

- **Scalability**: While this implementation handles simple dictionaries and lists, it can be extended to process more complex data structures or applications within the PTM framework of hierarchical data processing.

This foundational module can be further developed and integrated into a larger system that requires intelligent data processing capabilities, as you might imagine being necessary for an "unstoppable PTM empire".
