Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably an acronym for a specific company or framework) empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves implementing a system that can learn, adapt, and optimize itself over time. Here’s a design blueprint(for such a module:)

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Key Features:
1. **Self-Optimization**: A system that continuously improves its algorithms and outcomes.
2. **Recursive Learning**: Implements algorithms that can improve themselves over recursion.
3. **Hierarchical Processing**: Layered architecture where each layer performs a specific transformation or abstraction level.
4. **Adaptative Model Selection**: Automated selection of the best model based on performance metrics.
5. **Feedback Driven Evolution**: Real-time feedback loops to guide the learning algorithms.

#### Core Components:
1. **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**
2. **Recursive Neural Network Architectures**
3. **Model Training and Optimization**
4. **Performance Monitoring and Feedback**
5. **Autonomous Decision Making**

Below is a conceptual design with a basic implementation:

```python
# ptm_autonomy/__init__.py

# Import statements for submodules
from .data_processor import DataProcessor
from .recursive_nn import RecursiveNeuralNet
from .model_optimizer import ModelOptimizer
from .performance_monitor import PerformanceMonitor
from .decision_engine import DecisionEngine
```

---

**data_processor.py**
```python
# Imports necessary libraries and dependencies
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def preprocess(self, raw_data):
        # Transforms and cleans the input data
        processed_data = self._clean_data(raw_data)
        return processed_data

    def _clean_data(self, data):
        # Implement data cleaning techniques here
        # Example: Fill missing values, normalize, etc.
        return data.fillna(method='ffill').apply(np.cbrt)
```

**recursive_nn.py**
```python
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense

class RecursiveNeuralNet:
    def __init__(self, input_shape):
        self.input_shape = input_shape
        self.model = self._build_model()

    def _build_model(self):
        # Recursive LSTM model architecture
        inputs = Input(shape=self.input_shape)
        lstm_out = LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)(inputs)
        lstm_out = LSTM(32)(lstm_out)
        outputs = Dense(1, activation='linear')(lstm_out)
        
        model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
        model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
        return model

    def train(self, x_train, y_train, epochs=10):
        self.model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=epochs)

    def predict(self, x_test):
        return self.model.predict(x_test)
```

---

**model_optimizer.py**
```python
class ModelOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def optimize(self, model, training_data, validation_data):
        # Implement optimization techniques like hyperparameter tuning
        pass

    def evaluate_models(self, models, validation_data):
        # Compare models and select the best one
        pass
```

---

**performance_monitor.py**
```python
class PerformanceMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.records = []

    def log_performance(self, metrics):
        print(f'Performance: {metrics}')
        self.records.append(metrics)

    def get_trends(self):
        # Analyze trends in performance
        return self.records
```

---

**decision_engine.py**
```python
class DecisionEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def decide(self, inputs):
        # Implement autonomous decision making logic
        # Recursive layer of learning from historical decisions
        return 'Decision based on inputs and model analysis'
```

### Recursive Strategy Explanation
- **Recursive Neural Network**: The `RecursiveNeuralNet` class uses recursive LSTM layers that are particularly suited for areas requiring recursive pattern recognition.
- **Feedback Loop**: `PerformanceMonitor` records metrics, allowing models to benefit from real-time performance feedback which can lead to recursive adjustments in training.
- **Optimization Strategy**: The `ModelOptimizer` utilizes comprehensive optimization algorithms that recursively evaluate model performance and feedback to evolve the best model pruning suboptimal solutions dynamically.

### Final Notes:
- This is a prototype design with basic implementations. In practice, extending it would involve implementing comprehensive algorithms per section.
- Recursive strategies can be enhanced by integrating deep reinforcement learning where systems continuously assess rewards and punishments to adjust strategies dynamically.
- Scalability and real-time processing capability are key for deployment, requiring further integration with robust data pipelines and cloud computing resources.

This facilitates a versatile structure to support self-evolving autonomy within the PTM empire's broader frameworks.
