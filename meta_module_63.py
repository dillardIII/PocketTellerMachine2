Creating a new Python module for self-evolving autonomy stack as part of the PTM (Presumably a tech or AI entity) empire requires careful planning and design. We'll focus on leveraging recursive strategies, an aspect well-suited for growth that mimics natural and computational evolutionary processes. Below is a high-level design of the module with some speculative code elements and strategic descriptions:

### Key Components of the Module

1. **Recursive Learning**: Implementing mechanisms that allow iterative learning and self-improvement.
2. **Meta-Learning**: Facilitate learning how to learn by adjusting parameters dynamically based on performance.
3. **Automated Model Selection and Optimization**: Build functionalities that can autonomously select, test, and optimize machine learning models.
4. **Distributed Systems and Swarming**: Enable cooperative and distributed decision-making systems.
5. **Self-Healing Architectures**: Incorporate feedback loops for automatic debugging and error correction.

### Module Design

```python
# ptm_autonomy.py

import itertools
from typing import List, Callable, Any
import numpy as np

class RecursiveEvolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = []
        self.history = []
        self.evolution_functions = []

    def add_model(self, model):
        self.models.append(model)
        self.history.append({
            'model': model,
            'performance': np.inf
        })

    def add_evolution_function(self, func: Callable):
        self.evolution_functions.append(func)

    def evaluate(self):
        for record in self.history:
            performance = record['model'].evaluate()
            record['performance'] = performance
            print(f"Evaluating model {record['model']} with performance {performance}")

    def select_best_model(self):
        self.history.sort(key=lambda x: x['performance'])
        return self.history[0]['model']

    def recursive_evolve(self, rounds: int = 10):
        """Evolves models based on their performance recursively."""
        for _ in range(rounds):
            self.evaluate()
            best_model = self.select_best_model()
            print(f"Best model selected: {best_model}")

            for func in self.evolution_functions:
                offspring = func(best_model)
                if offspring not in self.models:
                    self.add_model(offspring)
            self.history = self.history[:len(self.models)]

    def meta_learn(self):
        """Adjust parameters dynamically based on recursive performance."""
        # Simplified example of meta-learning structure
        parameters = [5, 10, 15]  # Hyperparameters for illustration
        for p in parameters:
            print(f"Testing with parameter: {p}")
            for model in itertools.cycle(self.models):
                # Adjust model hyperparameters based on performance
                model.set_parameter(p)
                self.evaluate()

class SimpleModel:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name

    def evaluate():> float:
        """Placeholder for actual evaluation logic"""
        return np.random.random()  # Mock performance metric

    def set_parameter(self, param: Any):
        """Placeholder for adjusting model's parameters"""
        print(f"Setting model {self.name}'s parameter to {param}")

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

def mutate_model():> SimpleModel:
    """Mock mutation function that generates a variant of the given model"""
    print(f"Mutating model {model}")
    mutated = SimpleModel(f"{model.name}_mutated")
    return mutated

# Example usage of the module
def run_demo():
    evo_system = RecursiveEvolver()
    # Initialize with simple models
    evo_system.add_model(SimpleModel("BaseModel_1"))
    evo_system.add_model(SimpleModel("BaseModel_2"))

    # Add evolution strategies
    evo_system.add_evolution_function(mutate_model)

    # Begin recursive evolution
    evo_system.recursive_evolve()
    evo_system.meta_learn()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_demo()
```

### Strategies and Innovations

- **Recursive Evolution**: By iterating through the `recursive_evolve` method, models self-improve, with the best-performing configurations spawning the next generation.
- **Meta-Learning**: Adjusts learning processes and hyperparameters adaptively, allowing the stack to self-optimize over time.
- **Distributed and Cooperative Models**: This architecture can be expanded to incorporate networked models that learn collaboratively.
- **Swarm Intelligence**: Implementing strategies inspired by nature, such as swarm behavior, for distributed decision-making.

### Further Expansion

- The module can be extended using reinforcement learning algorithms for more sophisticated adaptive behavior.
- Integration with cloud platforms for scalable model deployment and evolution.
- Utilizing advanced data analytics to guide the evolution pathways and hyperparameter optimization. 

This basic design paves the way toward a more autonomous and adaptive system that responds to its environment and evolves across iterations.
