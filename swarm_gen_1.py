Creating a GPT swarm for a system like PTM Empire can be a complex task depending on the specific requirements and technologies involved. However, I can guide you on how to create a basic auto-generating framework in Python that can be extended to generate other components or "swarm builders" for your architecture. This theoretical example will focus on generating basic scaffold code for new modules in your swarm system.

Let's break this down into steps:

1. **Define the structure for a basic GPT swarm builder.**
2. **Create a generator function that writes the scaffold code to new files.**
3. **Extend the generator to customize the generated builders for PTM Empire.**

Here is a simple Python script to demonstrate this concept:

```python
import os

class GPTSwarmBuilderGenerator:
    def __init__(self, output_dir="generated_builders"):
        self.output_dir = output_dir
        # Ensure the directory exists
        os.makedirs(self.output_dir, exist_ok=True)
    
    def generate_builder(self, builder_name):
        # Define the base content for a new builder file
        file_content = f"""\"\"\"
{builder_name}.py

Auto-generated GPT swarm builder for PTM Empire.
\"\"\"

class {builder_name}:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialization code for {builder_name}
        pass

    def run(self):
        # Implementation for executing the swarm builder
        print("{builder_name} is running...")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    builder = {builder_name}()
    builder.run()
"""
        # Define the path for the new builder file
        file_path = os.path.join(self.output_dir, f"{builder_name.lower()}.py")
        
        # Write the content to the new file
        with open(file_path, "w") as file:
            file.write(file_content)
        
        print(f"Generated builder: {file_path}")

    def batch_generate(self, builder_names):
        # Generate multiple builders
        for name in builder_names:
            self.generate_builder(name)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    generator = GPTSwarmBuilderGenerator()
    generator.batch_generate(["SwarmBuilderA", "SwarmBuilderB", "SwarmBuilderC"])
```

### Explanation
- **`GPTSwarmBuilderGenerator` Class**: Manages the creation of new swarm builder files.
  - **`generate_builder` Method**: Writes a basic Python class template to a file with a name specified by `builder_name`.
  - **`batch_generate` Method**: Accepts a list of names to generate multiple builders in one execution.

### Execution
- **Initialization and Usage**: The script creates builders by running `batch_generate` with desired names, resulting in Python files that are ready to be customized for the specific tasks or roles they need to perform within PTM Empire.

### Customization Areas
Once you have the basic framework, consider:
- **Customizing `run` Method**: Implement the logic specific to how each GPT swarm builder should operate within PTM Empire.
- **Argument Handling**: Add argument parsing to support dynamic operations and configurations.
- **Integration Points**: Ensure that the generated builders can communicate effectively with the rest of the PTM Empire system, possibly by adding networking or API hooks in the generated scaffolds.

This example provides a basic framework to get you started and can be expanded or modified to fit more complex requirement and integration needs specific to your PTM Empire architecture.
