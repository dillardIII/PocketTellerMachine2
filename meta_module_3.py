To design a Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably, "Proactive Tactic Management") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack, we must focus on creating a system that adapts and optimizes itself continually. Here's a high-level design for a module that represents this concept, focusing on recursive strategies for autonomy and self-improvement:

### Module Overview

The module, called `AutonomyEnhancer`, will include several key components:

1. **Data Acquisition and Learning**: Continuously gather data and feedback to update models.
2. **Recursive Self-Improvement**: Implement strategies that allow the system to iteratively refine its logic.
3. **Decision Making and Problem Solving**: Utilize AI techniques to make informed decisions autonomously.
4. **Simulation and Testing**: Constantly simulate scenarios to test improvements in a safe environment.
5. **Self-Diagnosis and Healing**: Capabilities to identify and fix problems without external intervention.

### High-Level Components

```python
# autonomy_enhancer.py

class AutonomyEnhancer:
    def __init__(self, initial_data):
        self.model = self.initialize_model(initial_data)
        self.feedback_loop = self.create_feedback_loop()

    def initialize_model(self, data):
        # Initialize the baseline model with initial data
        model = self.train_model(data)
        return model

    def create_feedback_loop(self):
        # Create a self-contained feedback loop for continuous model improvement
        return RecursiveFeedbackLoop(self.model)

    def train_model(self, data):
        # Implement a machine learning model (e.g., neural network, decision tree)
        model = self.build_neural_network(data)
        model.train(data)
        return model

    def build_neural_network(self, data):
        # Example method to build a neural network
        # This can be replaced by any other recursive ML model
        pass

    def make_decision(self, input_data):
        # Use the model to make decisions based on input data
        decision = self.model.predict(input_data)
        self.apply_feedback(decision, input_data)
        return decision

    def apply_feedback(self, decision, input_data):
        # Apply feedback to refine the model
        feedback = self.gather_feedback(decision, input_data)
        self.feedback_loop.update(feedback)

    def gather_feedback(self, decision, input_data):
        # Implement a method to gather feedback data, possibly from simulations or real-world outcomes
        pass

    def simulate_scenarios(self):
        # Run simulations to test model improvements
        for scenario in self.generate_scenarios():
            self.make_decision(scenario)
    
    def generate_scenarios(self):
        # Method to generate test scenarios
        pass

# RecursiveFeedbackLoop class
class RecursiveFeedbackLoop:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        self.enhancement_factor = self.define_enhancement_factor()

    def define_enhancement_factor(self):
        # Recursive method to define enhancement factor
        return lambda x: x * 1.1  # Example: simple multiplicative growth

    def update(self, feedback):
        # Integrate feedback recursively to update the model
        self.model.update_weights(feedback)
        self.recursive_refinement(feedback)

    def recursive_refinement(self, feedback):
        # Recursive refinement of model parameters
        refinement = self.enhancement_factor(feedback)
        if self.converged(refinement):
            return
        self.model.update_parameters(refinement)
        self.recursive_refinement(refinement)

    def converged(self, refinement):
        # Check if the recursive refinement has converged:
        return abs(refinement) < 0.001  # Example convergence condition
```

### Key Features

1. **Recursive Feedback Loop**: Continuously updates model parameters based on gathered feedback, leveraging a multiplicative enhancement factor.

2. **Simulation**: Uses generated scenarios to test decisions and further tune the model, fostering a safe testing ground.

3. **Self-Diagnosis and Healing**: Capable of identifying poorly performing areas within its models or decision-making pathways. Eventually, it will be able to adjust its own learning strategies or model architectures when needed.

4. **Scalable and Extendable Architecture**: The design allows easy integration of new machine learning models, feedback mechanisms, or extensions as PTM's needs grow.

This setup provides a foundation for an autonomy stack with a focus on recursive, self-improving strategies that help the PTM empire maintain an adaptive edge.
