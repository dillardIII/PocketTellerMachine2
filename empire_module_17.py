Designing a new Python module to expand the autonomy stack for PTM (Presumably an autonomous vehicle or robotics empire) involves leveraging state-of-the-art technologies in machine learning, sensor fusion, and real-time decision-making. Here, I'll draft a high-level architecture and highlight the innovative strategies that can be employed.

### Module Name: `AutoEvolve`

#### Overview:
The `AutoEvolve` module is designed to enhance the self-evolving capabilities of autonomous systems through adaptive learning, advanced perception, proactive planning, and cooperative behavior. It integrates novel algorithms and techniques to facilitate continuous improvement and adaptivity in dynamic environments.

#### Key Components:

1. **Adaptive Learning Engine (ALE)**
   - **Strategy: Reinforcement Learning & Meta-Learning**
     - Use a combination of reinforcement learning (RL) and meta-learning to allow the system to continuously learn from interactions with the environment.
     - Implement an automated curriculum learning technique to systematically introduce increasingly complex tasks to the model.
   - **Innovative Approach: Self-Supervised Learning**
     - Integrate self-supervised learning mechanisms to label data without human intervention, utilizing redundancy and structure in sensor data.

2. **Advanced Perception System (APS)**
   - **Strategy: Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion**
     - Develop a multi-modal sensor fusion framework that intelligently combines visual, LIDAR, RADAR, and acoustic data to enhance environmental perception.
     - Utilize deep neural networks to improve object detection and classification accuracy while reducing latency.
   - **Innovative Approach: Edge AI Processing**
     - Employ edge AI techniques to process sensor data locally, reducing the need for cloud communication and enabling faster response times.

3. **Proactive Planning Module (PPM)**
   - **Strategy: Predictive Path Planning**
     - Implement a predictive path planning algorithm that forecasts potential future states of the environment based on current perceptions and historical data.
     - Use probabilistic graphical models to handle uncertainty and variability in dynamic environments.
   - **Innovative Approach: Real-Time Behavioral Cloning**
     - Adopt real-time behavioral cloning to mimic expert human driver behavior in new or unstructured environments, refining plans in reaction to novel stimuli.

4. **Cooperative Behavior Framework (CBF)**
   - **Strategy: Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communication**
     - Develop a cooperative behavior framework that facilitates V2X communication, ensuring vehicles can share critical data and intentions within complex scenarios.
   - **Innovative Approach: Swarm Intelligence**
     - Introduce swarm intelligence algorithms that allow a group of autonomous systems to coordinate and optimize group-based tasks in a decentralized manner.

#### Integration and Scalability

- **Microservices Architecture**
  - Design `AutoEvolve` using microservices, allowing each component to be independently developed, tested, and scaled.
  - Utilize RESTful APIs or gRPC for efficient inter-component communication.

- **Continuous Deployment & Enhancement**
  - Implement CI/CD pipelines with automated testing suites to rapidly deploy updates and enhance module capabilities.
  
- **Security and Compliance**
  - Ensure robust cybersecurity measures are in place for data integrity and privacy.
  - Adhere to industry standards and legal compliance for autonomous vehicle operation.

### Conclusion

The `AutoEvolve` module intends to push the boundaries of autonomy by integrating advanced machine learning techniques, fostering cooperation among systems, and ensuring continuous improvement through innovative strategies. Its scalable and adaptive architecture enables seamless expansion and integration within the existing PTM autonomy stack.
