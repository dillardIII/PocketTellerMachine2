Creating an advanced Python module with intelligent recursion for an imagined "unstoppable PTM empire" involves defining what PTM stands for in this context, as it could be a placeholder for something specific (e.g., "Predictive Text Module", "Photo Texture Mapping", or another domain-related entity). Since this is a fictional concept, I'll use "Predictive Text Module" as an example, and craft a Python module that intelligently applies recursion to improve text prediction. 

Hereâ€™s a basic outline of how you might build a simplified version of such a system with intelligent recursion:

```python
# ptm_predictor.py

class PredictiveTextModule:
    def __init__(self, corpus):
        """Initialize the predictive text module with a given corpus."""
        self.corpus = corpus
        self.word_tree = {}
        self._build_word_tree()

    def _build_word_tree(self):
        """Builds a word tree from the corpus for fast predictions."""
        for sentence in self.corpus:
            words = sentence.lower().split()
            self._add_sentence_to_tree(words)

    def _add_sentence_to_tree(self, words):
        """Recursively adds a sentence to the word tree."""
        current_level = self.word_tree
        for word in words:
            if word not in current_level:
                current_level[word] = {}
            current_level = current_level[word]
        # Mark the end of a sentence
        current_level['_end_'] = '_end_'

    def predict(self, current_phrase, max_depth=3):
        """Predict words based on the current phrase using intelligent recursion."""
        current_words = current_phrase.lower().split()
        sub_tree = self._get_sub_tree(current_words)

        if not sub_tree:
            return []

        # Use recursion to explore potential predictions
        predictions = self._recursive_predict(sub_tree, max_depth)
        return predictions
    
    def _get_sub_tree(self, words):
        """Get the subtree that matches the current words."""
        current_level = self.word_tree
        for word in words:
            if word in current_level:
                current_level = current_level[word]
            else:
                return None
        return current_level

    def _recursive_predict(self, subtree, depth):
        """Recursively explore the subtree to gather predictions."""
        if depth == 0 or '_end_' in subtree:
            return ['']

        predictions = []
        for word, next_subtree in subtree.items():
            if word == '_end_':
                continue
            subsequent_predictions = self._recursive_predict(next_subtree, depth - 1)
            for sub_pred in subsequent_predictions:
                prediction = (word + ' ' + sub_pred).strip()
                predictions.append(prediction)
        
        return predictions


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Example usage
    corpus = [
        "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
        "the quick brown fox",
        "the quick and clever fox",
        "hello world",
        "hello everyone",
        "hello there how are you"
    ]

    ptm = PredictiveTextModule(corpus)

    # Example prediction
    input_phrase = "the quick"
    print(f"Predictions for '{input_phrase}': {ptm.predict(input_phrase)}")

    input_phrase = "hello"
    print(f"Predictions for '{input_phrase}': {ptm.predict(input_phrase)}")
```

### Key Concepts:
- **Word Tree:** This is a tree-structured data model where each word points to potential subsequent words, facilitating swift predictions.
- **Intelligent Recursion:** The `_recursive_predict` function explores possible word sequences from a given point in the tree, constrained by a depth limit to avoid excessive computation or circular searching.
- **Predicate Marking:** Each sequence end is marked to help identify full sentences.

This code provides a basic framework to demonstrate intelligent recursion within a predictive text scenario. The module's intelligence could be enhanced by introducing machine learning techniques, context awareness, or probabilistic prediction models to refine the predictions further.
