Creating an advanced Python module for an "unstoppable PTM empire" using intelligent recursion requires a detailed understanding of what PTM refers to in your context, as it can stand for various things (e.g., Pre-trained Transformer Models, Project Time Management, etc.). However, I'll focus on creating a module that demonstrates advanced concepts like intelligent recursion, which can be beneficial in a wide range of applications. Let's assume PTM refers to some form of complex task management or problem-solving, and you'll want to apply recursion intelligently in this context.

Here's a Python module implementation that showcases intelligent recursive techniques for solving complex problems, such as navigating hierarchical task structures:

```python
# IntelligentRecursion.py

from functools import lru_cache

class IntelligentRecursor:
    def __init__(self, task_tree):
        """
        Initialize the IntelligentRecursor with a list of tasks in a hierarchical format.
        Each task could have subtasks in a nested dictionary format.
        
        :param task_tree: A dictionary representing the hierarchical structure of tasks.
        """
        self.task_tree = task_tree

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def solve_task(self, task_name):
        """
        Solve a task and its subtasks using intelligent recursion.

        :param task_name: The name of the task to solve.
        :return: A report summarizing the task completions.
        """
        task_info = self.task_tree.get(task_name, {})
        if not task_info:
            return f"No task named '{task_name}' found."
        
        subtasks = task_info.get('subtasks', [])
        
        print(f"Starting task: {task_name}")
        
        subtask_results = []
        for subtask in subtasks:
            print(f"Recursively solving subtask: {subtask}")
            result = self.solve_task(subtask)
            subtask_results.append(result)

        # Combine results
        results_summary = f"Task '{task_name}' completed with {len(subtask_results)} subtasks solved: {subtask_results}"
        return results_summary

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example task tree
    tasks = {
        "Root Task": {
            "subtasks": ["Subtask A", "Subtask B"]
        },
        "Subtask A": {
            "subtasks": ["Subtask A1", "Subtask A2"]
        },
        "Subtask B": {
            "subtasks": []
        },
        "Subtask A1": {
            "subtasks": []
        },
        "Subtask A2": {
            "subtasks": []
        }
    }

    recursor = IntelligentRecursor(tasks)
    final_report = recursor.solve_task("Root Task")
    print("\nFinal Report:")
    print(final_report)
```

### Explanation

- **Hierarchical Structure**: The tasks are stored in a dictionary representing a hierarchical structure. Each task may have zero or more subtasks.
- **Intelligent Recursion**: The `solve_task` method uses recursion to solve each task, branching off into subtasks when necessary.
- **Memoization**: We use Python's `functools.lru_cache` to cache previously computed results, which makes our recursion intelligent by avoiding redundant computations.
- **Detailed Output**: The program prints details of the task processing to visualize how recursion works through the structure.

You might expand this module by adding more features such as task-specific logic, error handling, or parallel processing for subtasks. This basic design lays a strong foundation for complex recursive task-solving applications.
