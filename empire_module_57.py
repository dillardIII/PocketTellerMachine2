Creating a Python module with intelligent recursion for a hypothetical PTM (Presumably, Pre-trained Model) empire involves designing functions that can leverage recursion in a smart way to solve complex problems. Intelligent recursion often implies optimizing recursive solutions with techniques like memoization, tail recursion, or dynamic programming to improve performance. Below is an example module that showcases intelligent recursion, tackling problems like Fibonacci sequence, factorial calculation, and solving the Tower of Hanoi problem using these advanced techniques.

```python
# intelligent_recursion.py

from functools import lru_cache

class IntelligentRecursion:
    """
    A collection of advanced recursive algorithms with optimizations for
    computational efficiency.
    """

    @staticmethod
    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def fibonacci(n):
        """
        Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using recursive approach
        with memoization to optimize performance.
        """
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Fibonacci number cannot be negative")
        if n <= 1:
            return n
        return IntelligentRecursion.fibonacci(n-1) + IntelligentRecursion.fibonacci(n-2)

    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n, accumulator=1):
        """
        Calculate the factorial of n using tail recursion.
        The accumulator holds the ongoing product of previous numbers.
        """
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Factorial cannot be negative")
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return accumulator
        return IntelligentRecursion.factorial(n-1, n*accumulator)

    @staticmethod
    def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves=None):
        """
        Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem using a recursive algorithm.
        Records the moves in a list.
        
        :param n: Number of disks
        :param source: The initial rod
        :param target: The target rod
        :param auxiliary: The auxiliary rod
        :param moves: List storing the sequence of moves
        :return: List of moves required to solve the puzzle
        """
        if moves is None:
            moves = []
        if n < 1:
            raise ValueError("Number of disks must be greater than 0")
        if n == 1:
            moves.append((source, target))
        else:
            IntelligentRecursion.tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)
            moves.append((source, target))
            IntelligentRecursion.tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)
        return moves

# Example of using the module

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Fibonacci
    print("Fibonacci(10):", IntelligentRecursion.fibonacci(10))

    # Factorial
    print("Factorial(5):", IntelligentRecursion.factorial(5))

    # Tower of Hanoi
    print("Tower of Hanoi moves (3 disks):")
    for move in IntelligentRecursion.tower_of_hanoi(3, 'A', 'C', 'B'):
        print(f"Move disk from {move[0]} to {move[1]}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Fibonacci with Memoization**: We use `functools.lru_cache` to cache results of the Fibonacci function, avoiding redundant calculations.

2. **Tail Recursive Factorial**: The factorial function uses an accumulator to hold ongoing results, promoting efficient recursion that can be optimized by Python interpreters recognizing tail recursion.

3. **Tower of Hanoi**: This classic problem demonstrates basic recursion with a more complex data manipulation, showing how to track state through recursive calls.

This module offers insights into optimizing recursion for more efficient compute tasks, aligning with computational needs like those likely faced within a "PTM empire."
