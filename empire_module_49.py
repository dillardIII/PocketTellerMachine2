Creating an advanced Python module with intelligent recursion for a problem or task within the context of the fictional "unstoppable PTM empire" can incorporate a variety of programming techniques. Below is an example of a module that utilizes intelligent recursion for solving complex tasks, such as managing hierarchical data structures or optimizing certain computations. 

This module will feature a recursive function to solve a problem while minimizing redundant calculations through memoization or dynamic programming techniques. Let’s assume the empire is dealing with complex hierarchical resource management, where each node represents an asset with production capabilities, and nodes can depend on others for resources.

```python
"""
ptm_resource_management.py

This module belongs to the unstoppable PTM empire and is designed to intelligently
manage resource production across a hierarchical structure using recursion 
and memoization to optimize resource dependencies and allocations.
"""

class Node:
    def __init__(self, name, production_capacity, dependencies=None):
        self.name = name
        self.production_capacity = production_capacity
        self.dependencies = dependencies if dependencies else []
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Node({self.name})"

class PTMEmpireResourceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memo = {}
    
    def calculate_total_production(self, node):
        """
        Recursively calculate the total production capacity, taking dependencies
        into account, with intelligent memoization to avoid redundant computations.
        
        :param node: Node object representing an asset.
        :return: Total production capacity considering dependencies.
        """
        if node in self.memo:
            return self.memo[node]
        
        total_production = node.production_capacity
        for dependency in node.dependencies:
            total_production += self.calculate_total_production(dependency)

        self.memo[node] = total_production
        return total_production

    def reset_memoization(self):
        """
        Clear memoization cache.
        """
        self.memo.clear()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create nodes with dependencies
    node_a = Node('A', 100)
    node_b = Node('B', 150, [node_a])
    node_c = Node('C', 200, [node_a, node_b])
    node_d = Node('D', 120, [node_c])

    # Initialize the resource manager
    resource_manager = PTMEmpireResourceManager()

    # Calculate total production capacity
    total_production = resource_manager.calculate_total_production(node_d)

    print(f"Total production capacity of {node_d}: {total_production}")
```

### Explanation

- **Node Class**: Represents an asset or resource in the empire with a production capacity and a list of dependencies on other nodes.
  
- **PTMEmpireResourceManager**: This class manages the calculation of total production capacity. It uses a dictionary `memo` to cache calculated values, ensuring that each node’s total production capacity is only computed once, thus optimizing the recursive process.

- **calculate_total_production Method**: This method uses recursion to calculate the total production taking dependencies into account. Through memoization, it reduces redundant calculations, speeding up the process significantly.

- **reset_memoization Method**: This method clears the memoization cache, which is useful when the hierarchical structures change and recalculations are necessary.

The script contains an example of how to initialize nodes and calculate their total production capacity considering dependencies. This approach can be further expanded to include more complex rules and insights into the asset dependencies of the PTM empire.
