Creating a Python module with intelligent recursion tailored for the hypothetical "unstoppable PTM empire" can be quite abstract. I'll interpret this as a Python module that showcases advanced recursion techniques, possibly relevant to a domain where recursion could be particularly useful, like data analysis, parsing, or solving complex problems. Let's assume PTM stands for "Pattern and Text Mining", and focus the module on intelligent recursive pattern recognition and processing.

Here's the module outline with comments and code:

```python
# ptm_recursion.py
"""
A Python module for the PTM (Pattern and Text Mining) empire featuring advanced recursive techniques.
This module provides intelligent recursive functions for parsing, pattern matching, and data analysis.
"""

class PTMRecursion:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def recursive_pattern_search(self, pattern, start=0):
        """
        Recursively search for a pattern in the self.data and return the start positions of matches.
        
        Args:
            pattern (str or any type): The pattern to search for in the data.
            start (int): The starting index for the search.

        Returns:
            list: A list of starting indices where the pattern is found.
        """
        matches = []
        
        def search_recursive(data, pattern, start):
            index = data.find(pattern, start)
            if index == -1:
                return
            matches.append(index)
            search_recursive(data, pattern, index + 1)
            
        search_recursive(self.data, pattern, start)
        return matches

    def intelligent_factorial(self, n, cache={0: 1, 1: 1}):
        """
        Compute the factorial of n using a memoized recursive approach.

        Args:
            n (int): The number for which factorial is to be computed.

        Returns:
            int: The factorial of the number.
        """
        if n in cache:
            return cache[n]
        cache[n] = n * self.intelligent_factorial(n - 1, cache)
        return cache[n]

    def parse_nested_structure(self, structure, depth=0):
        """
        Recursively parse a nested data structure (e.g., list of lists) and perform
        an operation at each level of depth (e.g., summing elements).

        Args:
            structure (list): The nested structure to parse.
            depth (int): The current depth level.

        Returns:
            int or other type: The result of processing the structure.
        """

        # Replace this with more complex logic as needed for processing
        if isinstance(structure, list):
            result = sum(self.parse_nested_structure(sub, depth + 1) for sub in structure)
            # Logging for demonstration purposes
            print(f"{'  ' * depth}Depth {depth}: Result = {result}")
            return result
        else:
            return structure

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = "abcpqrabcabc"
    ptm = PTMRecursion(data)
    print("Pattern matches:", ptm.recursive_pattern_search("abc"))

    print("Factorial of 5:", ptm.intelligent_factorial(5))

    nested_structure = [[1, 2, [3]], [4, [5, 6]], 7]
    print("Parsed Structure:", ptm.parse_nested_structure(nested_structure))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Recursive Pattern Search**:
   - This method recursively searches for a given pattern within `data`.
   - It finds all occurrences and returns their start indices.

2. **Intelligent Factorial**:
   - Using memoization, it recursively calculates the factorial, caching results to optimize performance.

3. **Parse Nested Structure**:
   - This function recursively processes a nested list (or other structures), demonstrating recursive parsing.

Each function shows different recursion techniques suitable for tasks like searching, mathematical problem-solving, and parsing nested structures, applicable to patterns and text mining tasks. Adjustments may be needed to tailor the logic to the specific nuances of the "PTM empire".
