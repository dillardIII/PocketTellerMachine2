Creating an "unstoppable PTM empire" with intelligent recursion in Python is an interesting challenge. Let's design a module that includes advanced features such as intelligent recursion for problem-solving, possibly aiming at a utility that solves complex problems by breaking them down into subproblems. Here, we'll create a Python module that implements a recursive solver framework, which could be adapted for various use-cases such as optimization problems, decision trees, or combinatorial searches.

Let's name our module `intelligent_recursion.py`.

```python
# intelligent_recursion.py

class IntelligentRecursion:
    """
    A class that provides a framework for solving complex problems using intelligent recursion.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, problem):
        """
        Initialize with a problem instance which provides specific 
        implementations for the methods needed for recursion.
        :param problem: An object that represents the problem instance.
        """
        self.problem = problem

    def solve(self, state=None):
        """
        Solve the problem starting from the given state.
        :param state: The current state; if None, start from the initial state.
        :return: The solution to the problem.
        """
        if state is None:
            state = self.problem.initial_state()
        
        # Base case: check if the current state is a solution
        if self.problem.is_solution(state):
            return self.problem.format_solution(state)
        
        # Recursive case: Iterate over possible actions
        action_space = self.problem.get_actions(state)
        solutions = []
        
        for action in action_space:
            next_state = self.problem.apply_action(state, action)
            if self.problem.is_valid(next_state):  # Intelligent pruning
                result = self.solve(next_state)
                if result is not None:
                    solutions.append(result)
        
        # Aggregate solutions, if there are any
        return self.problem.aggregate_solutions(solutions)

# Example usage:
# Define a problem that conforms to the methods used in IntelligentRecursion

class ExampleProblem:
    def initial_state(self):
        # Return the initial state of the problem
        pass

    def is_solution(self, state):
        # Determine if the state is a solution
        pass

    def get_actions(self, state):
        # Return a list of possible actions from the state
        pass

    def apply_action(self, state, action):
        # Return the new state after applying the action
        pass

    def is_valid(self, state):
        # Check if the state is valid (used for pruning)
        return True

    def format_solution(self, state):
        # Format the solution for output
        pass

    def aggregate_solutions(self, solutions):
        # An aggregate function, e.g., min, max, or combine results
        if solutions:
            return min(solutions)  # Example: minimize the result
        return None

# This module can be extended with specific problem classes that inherit from the ExampleProblem class.
```

### Explanation:

1. **Generic Framework**: The `IntelligentRecursion` class serves as a generic framework for solving problems recursively. It requires a `problem` instance that implements the necessary methods to perform problem-specific tasks.

2. **Problem Interface**: The `ExampleProblem` class outlines the expected interface for the problem that the recursive solver will tackle. This includes methods for determining the initial state, checking if a state is a solution, generating possible actions from a state, applying actions to states, validating states, formatting solutions, and aggregating partial solutions.

3. **Intelligent Pruning**: The recursion includes a pruning method (`is_valid`) which can be overridden in the problem instance to avoid unnecessary computation.

4. **Aggregation**: After recursive calls, solutions can be aggregated using a method such as minimizing, maximizing, or concatenating based on the needs of the problem.

This framework can solve various problems by simply tweaking the problem class, making it a versatile tool for different recursive challenges.
