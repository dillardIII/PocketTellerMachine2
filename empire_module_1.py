Creating an advanced Python module for an entity like the "unstoppable PTM empire" can be quite abstract without specific details on the desired functionality. However, I can provide a conceptual framework for a Python module that features intelligent recursion. Let's imagine this module deals with complex network analysis as part of a hypothetical global operation management system for PTM.

The module could include recursive algorithms with intelligent stopping conditions based on dynamic network analysis, assuming PTM deals with optimizing interconnected resources.

Here's an outline of what such a module might look like:

```python
# unstoppable_ptm_network.py

import networkx as nx

class IntelligentRecursion:
    def __init__(self, graph):
        """
        Initialize the IntelligentRecursion class with a graph.

        :param graph: A networkx graph representing the system's network.
        """
        self.graph = graph

    def intelligent_recursion(self, node, visited=None, depth=0, max_depth=5):
        """
        Perform intelligent recursion on the network graph.

        :param node: The starting node for recursion.
        :param visited: A set of already visited nodes.
        :param depth: The current depth of recursion.
        :param max_depth: Maximum allowed recursion depth.
        :return: An analysis summary of the path explored.
        """
        if visited is None:
            visited = set()

        # Stop recursion if max_depth is reached or if node already visited
        if depth == max_depth or node in visited:
            return

        # Mark the current node as visited
        visited.add(node)
        print(f"Visiting node: {node}, Depth: {depth}")

        # Perform some intelligent action/analysis on the current node
        self.analyze_node(node)

        # Recursively visit all neighbors of the current node
        for neighbor in self.graph.neighbors(node):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                self.intelligent_recursion(neighbor, visited, depth + 1, max_depth)

    def analyze_node(self, node):
        """
        Perform specific analysis or actions on the current node.

        :param node: The node to analyze.
        """
        # Dummy implementation: just print the node information
        print(f"Analyzing node: {node}")

        # Implement specific analysis logic here (e.g., resource optimization, data collection, etc.)

    def run_full_analysis(self, start_node):
        """
        Run the full intelligent network analysis starting from a specific node.

        :param start_node: The node to begin the analysis.
        """
        print(f"Starting network analysis from node: {start_node}")
        self.intelligent_recursion(start_node)


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a sample graph (with NetworkX)
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from([
        (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4),
        (4, 5), (5, 6), (3, 6)
    ])

    # Create an instance of the IntelligentRecursion class
    ir = IntelligentRecursion(G)

    # Run the full analysis from node 1
    ir.run_full_analysis(start_node=1)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Network Graph**: Uses the `networkx` library for handling and analyzing network graphs. This allows modeling interconnected systems easily.
2. **Recursive Exploration**: The `intelligent_recursion` method recursively traverses the graph to a specified depth (`max_depth`). Ensures the process stops or skips when it revisits nodes.
3. **Dynamic Conditions**: Could introduce more complex stopping conditions based on environment or node-specific data.
4. **Node Analysis**: The `analyze_node` method is a placeholder for the real-world logic needed for resource optimization or data collection at each node.
5. **Example Usage**: The module includes a simple example of how to set up a graph and run the analysis, demonstrating its use.

This code structure provides a starting point, and you can expand it with more advanced algorithms, intelligent conditions, and real-world data processing as needed for your application.
