Creating a GPT swarm that can auto-generate other GPT swarm builders is a complex task. It requires a deep understanding of distributed machine learning, swarm intelligence, and GPT architecture. Below is an illustrative example in Python to get you started with the concept of a simple swarm that can create other swarm builders. This example is highly simplified and conceptual in nature, as implementing a full-fledged system would be too elaborate to fit into this format.

Before you start, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You might need `transformers` for any GPT-related tasks, but since this is a conceptual framework, the actual transformer model isn't being used for generating other swarm builders in the example.

```python
import random

class GPTAgent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def generate(self, task):
        print(f"{self.name} is generating a solution for: {task}")
        return f"Solution for {task} by {self.name}"

class GPTSwarm:
    def __init__(self, num_agents):
        self.agents = [GPTAgent(f"Agent_{i}") for i in range(num_agents)]
        
    def assign_task(self, task):
        agent = random.choice(self.agents)
        print(f"Assigning task '{task}' to {agent.name}")
        return agent.generate(task)

    def replicate_swarm(self, num_new_agents):
        print(f"Replicating swarm with {num_new_agents} new agents.")
        return GPTSwarm(num_new_agents)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create the original swarm
    primary_swarm = GPTSwarm(num_agents=5)

    # Assign a task to the swarm
    task_result = primary_swarm.assign_task("Build a new GPT swarm")
    print(task_result)
    
    # Auto-generate new swarms
    new_swarms = []
    for i in range(3):  # Create 3 new swarms
        print(f"Creating swarm {i+1}")
        new_swarms.append(primary_swarm.replicate_swarm(num_new_agents=3))

    # Assign tasks to new swarms
    for i, swarm in enumerate(new_swarms, start=1):
        result = swarm.assign_task(f"Special task for swarm {i}")
        print(result)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **GPTAgent Class**: This represents a single agent in the swarm. It has a simple `generate` method, which is a placeholder for generating solutions.

2. **GPTSwarm Class**: This holds multiple GPTAgents and can assign tasks to them. An agent is chosen randomly to handle a task.

3. **Replicate Swarm**: The `replicate_swarm` method demonstrates the concept of generating new swarm instances (although, in practice, you'd involve more sophisticated methods for autonomy in generation).

4. **Main Execution**: The script initiates a swarm and demonstrates the replication process, showing how new swarms could be created and used to handle tasks.

In a full implementation, these agents would involve actual computation (perhaps running small models), inter-swarm communication, and handling more complex decision-making processes, including learning and optimizing for task-specific requirements.
