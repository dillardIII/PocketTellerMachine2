Creating an advanced Python module with intelligent recursion is an ambitious task. Let's break it down into something manageable. For the sake of this example, we will create a module that includes a recursive function, enhanced by intelligent caching, dynamic problem-solving capabilities, and error handling. We'll use a mix of classic recursion and make it intelligent with caching (via memoization) and exception handling.

In this example, let's implement a module that will include a function to solve the classic problem of calculating the nth Fibonacci number. We'll provide enhancements like memoization for efficiency and dynamic correction for common input errors.

Here's what the module might look like:

```python
# unstoppable_ptm.py
from functools import lru_cache

class RecursiveSolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self._cache = {}

    def fibonacci(self, n):
        """
        Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion with memoization.
        
        :param n: The index (starting from 0) in the Fibonacci sequence to calculate.
        :return: The nth Fibonacci number.
        :raises ValueError: If n is not an integer or is negative.
        """
        try:
            n = int(n)
            if n < 0:
                raise ValueError("Index cannot be negative.")

            return self._fib_memo(n)
        except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}. Attempting to handle input as a non-negative integer.")
            raise

    def _fib_memo(self, n):
        """
        A helper method for recursively calculating the Fibonacci number
        with caching to avoid redundant calculations.

        :param n: The index in the Fibonacci sequence.
        :return: The nth Fibonacci number.
        """
        if n in (0, 1):
            return n

        if n not in self._cache:
            self._cache[n] = self._fib_memo(n - 1) + self._fib_memo(n - 2)
        
        return self._cache[n]

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solver = RecursiveSolver()
    try:
        print("Fibonacci number for 10:", solver.fibonacci(10))
    except ValueError as ve:
        print(f"Error calculating Fibonacci number: {ve}")
```

### Features:

1. **Memoization**: The `_fib_memo` method caches calculations for every Fibonacci number it calculates for a given input, skipping redundant operations for numbers it has already computed. This is achieved by storing results in the `_cache` dictionary.

2. **Error Handling**: The `fibonacci` method includes error handling to catch improper inputs, such as negative numbers, non-integers, or non-numeric types, and throws informative exceptions.

3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: By coercing inputs to integers and checking their validity, the module can adapt to input variations and provide dynamic responses under error conditions.

This module serves as a basic example of intelligent recursion, designed for efficiency and robustness. It might be enhanced further with additional intelligent adaptations, such as handling larger data sets, optimizing for specific environments, or incorporating concurrency for parallel computations.
