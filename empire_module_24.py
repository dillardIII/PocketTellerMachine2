Designing a new Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical entity, perhaps a tech empire or organization) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves incorporating advanced features that leverage state-of-the-art technologies. Below is a conceptual outline and strategy for such a module, focusing on aspects like scalability, adaptability, and robustness.

### Module Overview

The module, named `auto_evolve`, aims to enhance the autonomy stack's capabilities through self-optimization, learning, and adaptability. It could utilize machine learning, neural networks, and algorithmic strategies to evolve and adapt without extensive human intervention.

### Key Features

1. **Self-Learning Algorithms**:
    - **Reinforcement Learning**: Implement a system using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for dynamic decision-making.
    - **Continual Learning**: Leverage memory-augmented neural networks to learn from new data while retaining previously learned knowledge. 

2. **Intelligent Data Processing**:
    - **Automated Data Labeling**: Use unsupervised/semi-supervised learning to categorize and annotate incoming data, reducing human labor.
    - **Real-Time Stream Processing**: Integrate Apache Kafka and Apache Flink for handling data streams efficiently.

3. **Adaptive Model Architecture**:
    - **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**: Employ NAS to automatically discover the optimal deep learning architecture for specific tasks.
    - **Model Pruning and Quantization**: Optimize models for performance and efficiency on edge devices, using techniques like weight pruning.

4. **Dynamic Environment Interaction**:
    - **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Implement methods to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world environments using domain adaptation techniques.
    - **Environment Mapping & Prediction**: Use generative models to predict changes or anomalies in the operating environment.

5. **Scalability and Flexibility**:
    - **Containerization and Microservices**: Opt for a Kubernetes-based architecture to deploy scalable microservices.
    - **Modular Design**: An easily extendable module that acts as plug-and-play, allowing for new functionalities to be added seamlessly.

### Innovative Strategies

1. **Federated Learning**: Implement federated learning to enable privacy-preserving, distributed model training across the empire’s diverse data sources.

2. **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Incorporate techniques for explainability to enhance trust and transparency in the system's decision-making processes.

3. **Edge AI**: Extend the autonomy stack with edge computing capabilities for low-latency decision making and reduced bandwidth usage.

4. **Robustness and Security**: Implement adversarial training and security defenses against potential attacks to ensure robustness and reliability.

5. **Feedback Loops for Self-Improvement**: Design closed feedback loops where the system continuously evaluates its performance and refines its strategies.

This module, `auto_evolve`, designed with cutting-edge features and strategies, aims to significantly boost the PTM empire’s self-evolving autonomy stack, laying a foundation for future advancements in autonomous systems.
