Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably, a hypothetical autonomous system or company related to autonomy like PTM AI) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack is an exciting challenge. The goal is to enhance the AI stack with recursive, self-improving capabilities. Here, we'll outline a high-level design, touching on critical elements and incorporating innovative recursive strategies.

### Module Name: `autonomous_self_evolver`

#### Key Features & Components:

1. **Recursive Learning Engine**:
   - A core engine that allows the autonomy stack to not only learn from past data but revisit decisions and outcomes recursively to improve performance.
   - **Implementation Strategy**:
     - Implement a feedback loop mechanism where past decisions are analyzed in the context of new data, leading to continuous model refinement.
     - Use reinforcement learning frameworks like Stable Baselines or TensorFlow Agents to facilitate this learning cycle.

2. **Adaptive Module Integration**:
   - Allow the autonomy stack to dynamically load, unload, and switch between modules based on situational needs.
   - **Implementation Strategy**:
     - Design a plugin architecture where modules register their capabilities and the core system chooses the best module based on current environment metrics.
     - Use Python's importlib and abstract base classes to manage module lifecycle and interfaces.

3. **Meta-Learning Capabilities**:
   - Incorporate meta-learning strategies to help the AI system generalize across tasks by learning how to learn.
   - **Implementation Strategy**:
     - Implement algorithms like MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) which adjust the learning process itself rather than just the learning model.
     - Integrate a task generator to train the meta-learning system on a variety of scenarios.

4. **Autonomy Evaluator**:
   - A system to evaluate the performance of autonomous decision-making in real-time, with an ability to roll back strategies or enhance them.
   - **Implementation Strategy**:
     - Develop a multi-metric evaluation framework including safety, efficiency, and user satisfaction metrics.
     - Use a combination of rule-based analysis and machine learning to assess decisions and suggest improvements.

5. **Self-Optimization Algorithims**:
   - Allow the system to optimize its operational parameters autonomously.
   - **Implementation Strategy**:
     - Implement genetic algorithms or other evolutionary strategies to explore and optimize the parameter space.
     - Use optimization libraries like Optuna for parameter tuning.

6. **Data Lake Integration**:
   - Seamless connection to a data lake to store and retrieve large amounts of observational data for long-term learning.
   - **Implementation Strategy**:
     - Use AWS or Azure data lake services, integrating with Python's boto3 or azure-storage library for data handling.
     - Design strategies for data preprocessing and efficient querying within the module.

### Example Code:

```python
# autonomous_self_evolver/core.py

import importlib
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import optuna

class BaseModule(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, environment_state):
        pass

class RecursiveLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.past_decisions = []

    def learn(self, decisions, outcomes, environment):
        # Implementation of a recursive learning process
        pass

class AutonomyEvaluator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = []

    def evaluate(self, strategy, outcomes):
        # Evaluation process
        pass

class AutonomousSelfEvolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.modules = {}

    def load_module(self, module_name):
        module = importlib.import_module(module_name)
        if issubclass(module, BaseModule):
            self.modules[module_name] = module()
        else:
            raise ImportError("Module does not comply with BaseModule structure")

    def run(self, environment_state):
        best_module = self.select_best_module(environment_state)
        if best_module:
            return self.modules[best_module].execute(environment_state)

    def select_best_module(self, environment_state):
        # Logic to select the best module
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ase = AutonomousSelfEvolver()
    ase.load_module('path.to.module')
    # Environment state would be defined by the particular application
    environment_state = {}
    ase.run(environment_state)
```

This high-level module design for an autonomous system stack emphasizes self-evolution through recursive learning, module adaptability, and meta-learning capabilities, providing a foundation for dynamic and robust autonomous operations. Expansion of this design would include the integration of actual logic for learning, module execution, and evaluation suited to your specific use case.
