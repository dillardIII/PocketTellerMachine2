Creating an advanced Python module with intelligent recursion requires a combination of efficient algorithms, leveraging Python's features, and possibly integrating machine learning components if the task demands it. Below, I'll outline a sample Python module, `smart_recursion.py`, which showcases a recursive function optimized with memoization. It's designed to solve a challenging problem more efficiently than naive recursion would allow. 

The problem we'll use as an example is the calculation of the nth Fibonacci number, augmented with some intelligent behavior. Additionally, we'll demonstrate how recursion can intelligently backtrack and prune unnecessary branches based on predefined conditions.

```python
# smart_recursion.py

from functools import lru_cache

class SmartRecursion:
    """
    A class that demonstrates intelligent recursion techniques with memoization.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize any necessary state variables here
        pass

    @staticmethod
    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)  # Cache results of Fibonacci calculation
    def fibonacci(n):
        """
        Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using a recursive approach
        with memoization to optimize performance.
        """
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("The input number must be a non-negative integer.")
        
        if n <= 1:
            return n
        
        return SmartRecursion.fibonacci(n - 1) + SmartRecursion.fibonacci(n - 2)

    def intelligent_backtracking_example(self, n, condition_func):
        """
        An advanced example of recursion with intelligent pruning/backtracking.

        :param n: The depth of the recursion or problem complexity
        :param condition_func: A function that decides whether to prune a branch
        :return: Processed result based on intelligent recursion
        """
        # Example condition function passed could be a lambda: lambda x: x % 2 != 0
        def helper(current, path):
            """

            on a condition.
            """
            if current > n:
                return None

            if condition_func(current):
                # Prune this branch
                return None

            # Process the current path
            path_result = self.process_path(path + [current])

            # Recursively explore further
            right = helper(current + 1, path)
            down = helper(current + 2, path)

            # Combine results if needed by the application logic
            return path_result, right, down

        return helper(0, [])

    def process_path(self, path):
        """
        A dummy processing function to simulate some meaningful operation
        on a recursion path.
        """
        # Example: Sum the elements in the path
        return sum(path)


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sr = SmartRecursion()

    # Fibonacci calculation
    print("Fibonacci (10):", sr.fibonacci(10))  # Should print 55

    # Intelligent recursion with pruning
    # Example condition_func that prunes paths containing odd numbers
    result = sr.intelligent_backtracking_example(10, lambda x: x % 2 != 0)
    print("Pruned recursion result:", result)
```

### Key Features of the Module:
1. **Memoization with `functools.lru_cache`:** This decorator caches the results of the Fibonacci calculation, drastically reducing the number of repeated calculations and improving efficiency.
   
2. **Intelligent Backtracking:** The `intelligent_backtracking_example` method showcases a recursive strategy where branches of the recursive tree can be conditionally pruned based on the output of a custom function (`condition_func`).

3. **Separation of Concerns:** The processing logic (`process_path`) is encapsulated within its own method, making the recursion strategy flexible and easy to modify according to the problem's needs.

This module forms the basis of an intelligent recursive system that can be extended with more complex logic, such as different pruning strategies or integration with machine learning models to decide on branch pruning.
