Designing a new Python module for the PTM (Presumably, a fictional or hypothetical technology firm) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating systems that can learn, adapt, and evolve independently. Considering that recursive strategies can be highly effective in devising solutions that improve over iterations, the module should focus on implementing algorithms that use recursion for continuous learning and adaptation.

Here's an outline for a module named `autonomy_stack` that incorporates innovative recursive strategies:

### Module: autonomy_stack

#### Key Components:
1. **Recursive Neural Networks (RNN):** Utilize recursive structures to process hierarchical data or sequences, allowing for improved learning over time.

2. **Genetic Algorithms:** Implement recursive genetic algorithms to evolve solutions over successive generations, adapting to changing environments.

3. **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use recursive search techniques to optimize hyperparameters in machine learning models.

4. **Self-Improving Planning Systems:** Develop a recursive strategy to refine plan generation over iterations based on feedback loops.

#### Implementation Strategy

1. **RNN Implementation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class RecursiveNeuralNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):
        super(RecursiveNeuralNet, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        h0 = torch.zeros(1, x.size(0), self.hidden_size).to(x.device)
        out, _ = self.rnn(x, h0)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        return out
```

2. **Genetic Algorithm Framework**

```python
import random

def recursive_genetic_algorithm(population, fitness_fn, generations=100):
    for generation in range(generations):
        # Sort by fitness
        population.sort(key=fitness_fn, reverse=True)

        # Selection: Choose the top performers
        selected = population[:len(population) // 2]

        # Crossover and modify the population
        offspring = []
        while len(offspring) < len(population) // 2:
            parent1, parent2 = random.sample(selected, 2)
            child = crossover(parent1, parent2)
            offspring.append(mutate(child))

        # Recursively apply to new population
        population = selected + offspring
        recursive_genetic_algorithm(population, fitness_fn, generations - 1)
    
    return max(population, key=fitness_fn)

# Crossover and mutate functions to be defined based on problem specifics
```

3. **Recursive Hyperparameter Tuning**

```python
def recursive_hyperparameter_tuning(model, params, data, max_depth=5):
    if max_depth == 0:
        return evaluate_model(model, params, data)

    best_score = float('-inf')
    best_params = params
    for param_combination in generate_param_combinations(params):
        score = recursive_hyperparameter_tuning(model, param_combination, data, max_depth - 1)
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_params = param_combination

    return best_params

# Helper functions for evaluating the model and generating parameter combinations to be defined.
```

4. **Self-Improving Planning System**

```python
class RecursivePlanner:
    def __init__(self, initial_plan):
        self.plan = initial_plan

    def improve_plan(self, evaluate_fn, adapt_fn, max_iterations=10):
        for _ in range(max_iterations):
            score = evaluate_fn(self.plan)
            if score < threshold:
                self.plan = adapt_fn(self.plan)
            else:
                break
        return self.plan
```

#### Key Considerations:

- **Scalability:** Ensure the module handles real-world scalability issues, allowing for efficient computation and memory use.
- **Flexibility:** Design the implementations to be flexible, supporting various application domains.
- **Robustness:** Include exception handling and testing frameworks to handle unexpected scenarios gracefully.
- **Feedback Loops:** Incorporate mechanisms to iteratively refine models based on real-time feedback.

Implementing these components in a cohesive module offers a powerful set of tools for elevating PTM's autonomy stack to self-evolve effectively. These recursive strategies foster adaptive systems capable of continuous improvement.
