Creating an advanced Python module for a hypothetical "PTM empire" requires some context about what PTM stands for and what its business or functional goals are. However, in the absence of specific details, I will suggest a generic yet advanced module that showcases the concept of "intelligent recursion" in a computational or functional scenario. This module can be adapted to different contexts based on the specific needs of the empire.

Let's assume PTM stands for "Predictive Transaction Manager," and the goal is to apply efficient recursive algorithms to predict future transactions based on past data. The module will include intelligent recursion techniques optimized for performance and scalability, and preventative measures to handle large datasets with recursion.

```python
# predictive_transaction_manager.py
from typing import List, Dict, Any
from functools import lru_cache

class TransactionPredictor:
    def __init__(self, transactions: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> None:
        self.transactions = transactions
    
    def predictive_sum(self, depth: int) -> float:
        """
        Use intelligent recursion to calculate a predictive sum of transactions
        The recursion is optimized using dynamic programming techniques.
        
        :param depth: Number of levels to consider in future predictions
        :return: Predictive sum of transactions
        """
        
        @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
        def helper(index: int, depth: int) -> float:
            if index >= len(self.transactions) or depth == 0:
                return 0.0
            current_value = self.transactions[index]["amount"]
            print(f"Processing transaction at index {index}, depth {depth}, amount {current_value}")
            
            # Recursive step: predict next using intelligent pattern recognition
            return current_value + helper(index + 1, depth - 1)
        
        return helper(0, depth)

    def progressive_forecast(self, start_index: int, depth: int) -> List[float]:
        """
        Generates a progressive forecast results using a mixed recursive-iterative approach

        :param start_index: Index to begin forecasting
        :param depth: Depth of forecast recursion iterations
        :return: List of forecasted transaction amounts
        """

        forecast = []
        while start_index < len(self.transactions) and depth > 0:
            forecast_value = self.predictive_sum(depth)
            forecast.append(forecast_value)
            start_index += 1
            depth -= 1
            print(f"Forecast for start_index {start_index} at depth {depth}: {forecast_value}")
        
        return forecast

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sample_transactions = [
        {"amount": 100.0},
        {"amount": 150.0},
        {"amount": 200.0}
    ]

    predictor = TransactionPredictor(sample_transactions)
    print("Predictive Sum: ", predictor.predictive_sum(2))
    print("Progressive Forecast: ", predictor.progressive_forecast(0, 3))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Intelligent Recursion with Memoization:** The `predictive_sum` method uses recursion with memoization provided by the `lru_cache` decorator to efficiently compute sums by caching results of subproblems.

2. **Dynamic and Scaled Predictions:** The `progressive_forecast` method uses a mixed recursive-iterative approach, making forecasts over a range of depths adaptively.

3. **Scalability and Optimization:** The use of caching and mixed strategies enables this module to handle larger datasets efficiently without the typical stack overflow issues associated with naive recursion.

This module can serve as a foundation for a more specialized predictive transaction management system, where additional functionality, such as integrating machine learning models for pattern recognition, can be implemented to enhance prediction accuracy and efficiency further.
