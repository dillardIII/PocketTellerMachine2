When designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably referring to Power Train Management or a similar concept) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack, it's essential to incorporate innovative recursive strategies that facilitate adaptive learning and decision-making. This module should focus on self-optimization, continuous learning, and robust decision-making in dynamic environments.

Below is a high-level outline and an example of a Python module that could serve this purpose. The code sample focuses on recursive strategies like feedback loops, self-tuning algorithms, and environment interaction.

```python
# ptm_auto_stack.py

import numpy as np
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s: %(message)s')

class AutoStack:
    """A class representing a self-evolving autonomy stack for the PTM empire."""

    def __init__(self, initial_state):
        self.state = initial_state
        self.learning_rate = 0.1
        self.goal = np.random.uniform(-10, 10)  # Arbitrary goal for demonstration
        logging.info(f"Initialized with state: {self.state} and goal: {self.goal}")

    def recursive_strategy(self, iterations):
        """Recursive strategy that refines the state towards achieving the goal."""
        for i in range(iterations):
            self.state = self.feedback_loop(self.state)
            logging.info(f"Iteration {i+1}: State updated to {self.state}")
            if self.convergence_check():
                logging.info("Goal achieved!")
                break

    def feedback_loop(self, state):
        """
        A feedback loop function that simulates environment interaction
        and adjusts state based on performance measures.
        """
        performance_measure = self.performance_function(state)
        state_update = self.learning_rate * (self.goal - performance_measure)
        new_state = state + state_update

        # Constraint the new state based on real-world parameters
        new_state = self.constraint_function(new_state)

        logging.debug(f"Performance measure: {performance_measure}, State update: {state_update}")

        return new_state

    def performance_function(self, state):
        """Simulated performance measure of the current state."""
        return np.sin(state)  # Simplified example

    def constraint_function(self, new_state):
        """Constraints to ensure new state is within permissible bounds."""
        # For example, limit state to [-10, 10]
        constrained_state = np.clip(new_state, -10, 10)
        return constrained_state

    def convergence_check(self):
        """Check if the current state is close enough to the goal.""":
        return np.isclose(self.state, self.goal, atol=0.01)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    initial_state = np.random.uniform(-10, 10)
    auto_stack = AutoStack(initial_state)
    auto_stack.recursive_strategy(100)
```

### Key Features & Innovations:

1. **Recursive Strategies**: The use of controlled recursion through feedback loops allows the system to continually refine its state with each iteration, adapting based on prior outcomes.

2. **Feedback Loop**: The feedback loop function models interactions with an environment, adjusting the system's state according to performance measures and constraints.

3. **Environment Interaction**: The module can easily be extended to incorporate real-world data for state updates, making it highly adaptable.

4. **Self-Tuning Learning Rate**: Further innovation could include dynamic adjustment of the learning rate based on performance, enhancing convergence speed without overshooting.

5. **Convergence Checks**: This ensures that the system minimizes unnecessary computations once the goal is achieved, conserving resources.

6. **Logging**: Integrated logging provides insights into the system's decision process, assisting with debugging and future enhancements.

### Next Steps:

- Expand functionality to include machine learning techniques for more sophisticated performance evaluations.
- Incorporate real-time data inputs and outputs for more dynamic behavior.
- Design an API for broader integration with other systems and components within the PTM ecosystem.

This module aims to provide a foundation for a self-evolving autonomy stack, enhancing adaptability and performance through recursive strategies and environment interaction.
