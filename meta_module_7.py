Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably an acronym representing the empire's specific context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves several key components. To achieve this, we can focus on building a system that incorporates machine learning (ML), recursive algorithms, and adaptive feedback mechanisms to enable self-evolution. Below is a high-level blueprint(of such a module:)

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy`

### Key Components:

1. **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing:**
    - Continuously collects and preprocesses data from diverse sources (sensors, IoT devices, or external APIs).
    - Ensures data quality and consistency.

2. **Recursive Learning Algorithm:**
    - Implements recursive machine learning models that improve iteratively.
    - Uses techniques like recursive neural networks (RNNs) and recursive decision trees.
    - Incorporates meta-learning principles for adaptation.

3. **Feedback Loop Mechanism:**
    - Establishes a feedback loop to dynamically adjust models and parameters based on performance metrics.
    - Uses reinforcement learning for continuous feedback from the environment.

4. **Adaptation and Evolution:**
    - Employs evolutionary strategies to select and optimize models and parameters over time.
    - Supports genetic algorithms for evolving model architectures and hyperparameters.

5. **Autonomy Decision Making:**
    - Integrates a decision-making engine that leverages recursive models to make autonomous decisions.
    - Uses multi-agent systems for collaborative decision making across different modules.

6. **Monitoring and Logging:**
    - Implements real-time monitoring of models and decision outputs.
    - Provides logging capabilities for debugging and transparency.

7. **Security and Privacy Measures:**
    - Ensures data security and model robustness against adversarial attacks.
    - Complies with privacy regulations and ethics guidelines.

### Implementation Outline:

```python
# ptm_autonomy.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from rnn_module import RecursiveNeuralNetwork
from evolution_strategies import GeneticAlgorithm
from decision_engine import DecisionEngine
from feedback_mechanism import ReinforcementLearner
from data_handling import DataIngestion

class PTMAutonomy:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize data handler
        self.data_handler = DataIngestion()

        # Initialize recursive learning model
        self.model = RecursiveNeuralNetwork()

        # Initialize feedback and decision engine
        self.feedback_learner = ReinforcementLearner()
        self.decision_engine = DecisionEngine()

        # Initialize evolutionary strategy for model evolution
        self.evolution_strategy = GeneticAlgorithm()

    def preprocess_data(self, data):
        # Preprocess data using standard scaling
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        return scaler.fit_transform(data)

    def train_model(self, data, target):
        # Split data
        x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, target, test_size=0.2)

        # Train recursive model
        self.model.fit(x_train, y_train)
        
        # Evaluate the model
        accuracy = self.model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
        print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")

    def feedback_loop(self, environment_state):
        # Use reinforcement learner to adaptively adjust model
        self.model = self.feedback_learner.optimize(self.model, environment_state)

    def evolve_strategy(self):
        # Evolve model using genetic algorithms
        self.model = self.evolution_strategy.evolve(self.model)

    def decision_making(self, input_data):
        # Make autonomous decision
        decision = self.decision_engine.make_decision(self.model, input_data)
        return decision

    def run(self):
        # Continuous loop for the system
        while True:
            data, target = self.data_handler.get_data()
            processed_data = self.preprocess_data(data)
            self.train_model(processed_data, target)
            current_state = self.data_handler.get_environment_state()
            self.feedback_loop(current_state)
            self.evolve_strategy()
            decision = self.decision_making(processed_data)
            self.log_decision(decision)

    def log_decision(self, decision):
        # Implement logging mechanism
        print(f"Logging decision: {decision}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ptm_system = PTMAutonomy()
    ptm_system.run()
```

### Further Considerations:
- **Scalability:** Ensure the system is scalable to handle large datasets and complex decision-making scenarios.
- **Robustness:** Implement safeguards against erroneous or malicious data inputs.
- **Explainability:** Develop methods to ensure that the decision-making process is transparent and explainable.
