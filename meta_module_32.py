Designing a new Python module to expand PTM Empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that enables recursive learning and adaptation. Here's a basic framework and architectural design that you can build upon:

### Module Overview

The module, named `ptm_autonomy`, is designed for recursive self-learning and adaptation. It involves a layered approach with each layer capable of evolving and contributing to higher-level decisions.

### Key Components

1. **Data Collection Layer**: Gathers raw sensory and environmental data.
2. **Preprocessing and Feature Extraction**: Processes raw data into meaningful features.
3. **Recursive Learning Engine**: Learns and adapt recursively by stacking or blending models.
4. **Decision-Making Layer**: Decides actions based on processed data and learned models.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Continuously updates the learning engine based on the outcomes of decisions.

### Module Design

```python
# ptm_autonomy/__init__.py
__version__ = '0.1.0'

# ptm_autonomy/data_collector.py
class DataCollector:
    def __init__(self, sensors):
        self.sensors = sensors

    def collect(self):
        # Collect raw data from sensors
        data = {sensor.name: sensor.read() for sensor in self.sensors}
        return data

# ptm_autonomy/preprocessor.py
class Preprocessor:
    def process(self, raw_data):
        # Convert raw data into a feature matrix
        return self.extract_features(raw_data)

    @staticmethod
    def extract_features(raw_data):
        # Placeholder for actual feature extraction logic
        return {key: sum(values) for key, values in raw_data.items()}

# ptm_autonomy/learning_engine.py
class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self, models):
        self.models = models  # List of model instances (e.g., neural networks)

    def train(self, features, labels):
        # Train each model recursively
        for model in self.models:
            model.fit(features, labels)

    def predict(self, features):
        # Aggregate predictions from all models
        predictions = [model.predict(features) for model in self.models]
        return self.blend_predictions(predictions)

    @staticmethod
    def blend_predictions(predictions):
        # Placeholder for blending logic, e.g., voting or averaging
        return max(set(predictions), key=predictions.count)

# ptm_autonomy/decision_maker.py
class DecisionMaker:
    def make_decision(self, prediction):
        # Translate prediction to actions
        decision = self.map_prediction_to_action(prediction)
        return decision

    @staticmethod
    def map_prediction_to_action(prediction):
        # Placeholder for decision logic
        action_map = {0: 'move_forward', 1: 'turn_left', 2: 'turn_right'}
        return action_map.get(prediction, 'halt')

# ptm_autonomy/feedback_loop.py
class FeedbackLoop:
    def __init__(self, learner):
        self.learner = learner

    def update(self, new_data, outcome):
        # Use outcome to fine-tune the learning process
        features = self.extract_features(new_data)
        self.learner.train(features, outcome)

    @staticmethod
    def extract_features(data):
        # Placeholder for feature extraction
        return data

# ptm_autonomy/main.py
from .data_collector import DataCollector
from .preprocessor import Preprocessor
from .learning_engine import RecursiveLearner
from .decision_maker import DecisionMaker
from .feedback_loop import FeedbackLoop

def main():
    # Initialize components
    sensors = []  # Fill with sensor instances
    models = []   # Fill with model instances
    data_collector = DataCollector(sensors)
    preprocessor = Preprocessor()
    learner = RecursiveLearner(models)
    decision_maker = DecisionMaker()
    feedback_loop = FeedbackLoop(learner)

    # Main loop
    while True:
        raw_data = data_collector.collect()
        features = preprocessor.process(raw_data)
        prediction = learner.predict(features)
        decision = decision_maker.make_decision(prediction)
        
        # Execute decision (implementation needed)
        execute_action(decision)
        
        # Provide feedback for learning
        outcome = get_current_outcome()  # Explore feedback mechanism
        feedback_loop.update(raw_data, outcome)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Strategies for Recursive Learning and Innovation

1. **Model Stacking**: Use ensemble techniques, combining multiple models (e.g., boosting, bagging) to improve prediction accuracy.

2. **Online Learning**: Continuously update the model with new data, allowing it to adapt to dynamic environments.

3. **Meta-Learning**: Employ techniques like model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to enable quick adaptation to new tasks with minimal data.

4. **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: Incorporate RL to improve recursive feedback and decision-making under uncertainty.

5. **Feedback-Driven Exploration**: Implement exploration mechanisms within the feedback loop to evaluate and learn from unexplored states.

6. **Explainable AI**: Introduce transparency in decision-making to facilitate debugging and trust in autonomy, using techniques like SHAP or LIME.

This structure provides a foundation for designing a self-evolving autonomy stack with recursive learning capabilities, suitable for the PTM Empire's requirements of continuous adaptation and innovation.
