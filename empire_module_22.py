Creating an advanced Python module that incorporates intelligent recursion requires thoughtful design to ensure robustness and efficiency. Below, I'll outline a Python module that uses recursion intelligently to solve a class of problemsâ€”specifically, generating permutations of a list. This module will include optimizations to handle larger datasets and prevent potential recursion depth issues.

Python Module: `ptm_permutations.py`

```python
# ptm_permutations.py

from itertools import islice

def _generate_permutations(prefix, remaining_elements, results, max_results):
    """
    Internal helper function to recursively generate permutations.

    :param prefix: Current permutation being built.
    :param remaining_elements: Elements to permute.
    :param results: Collector for completed permutations.
    :param max_results: Maximum number of results to yield.
    """
    if len(results) >= max_results:
        return

    if not remaining_elements:
        results.append(prefix)
        return

    for i in range(len(remaining_elements)):
        next_prefix = prefix + [remaining_elements[i]]
        next_elements = remaining_elements[:i] + remaining_elements[i+1:]
        
        # Recurse with next element fixed and others to permute
        _generate_permutations(next_prefix, next_elements, results, max_results)

def intelligent_permutations(input_list, max_results=1000):
    """
    Generate permutations of the input list intelligently.

    :param input_list: List of elements to permute.
    :param max_results: Maximum number of permutations to return.
    :return: Iterator over the permutations.
    """
    results = []
    _generate_permutations([], input_list, results, max_results)
    return iter(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    test_list = [1, 2, 3]
    perm_iterator = intelligent_permutations(test_list, max_results=10)
    for perm in perm_iterator:
        print(perm)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Recursive Function** (`_generate_permutations`): This internal function constructs permutations by recursively building each permutation step-by-step. It uses an accumulator (`prefix`) to store the current state of the permutation being constructed.

2. **Intelligent Limiting**: The function takes a `max_results` parameter to control recursion depth and output size, which is crucial for large lists that would otherwise generate an overwhelming number of permutations (n!).

3. **Controlled Output**: By using an iterator (`iter(results)`), you can efficiently handle potentially large outputs without requiring all results to be stored in memory simultaneously.

4. **Intended Use**: The module is intended for generating a limited number of permutations, which can be iterated over or examined without committing to generating all possible permutations in memory.

### Usage Considerations:

- **Scalability**: This module should comfortably handle smaller datasets and a controlled number of permutations from larger datasets.
- **Evaluation**: Use in scenarios where you need up to `max_results` permutations of a given list without generating all possible permutations.
- **Flexibility**: Easily adjustable for different use cases by modifying the `max_results` parameter.

This module provides a foundation for using recursive algorithms in a more controlled and intelligent way, focusing on practical usability and resource constraints.
