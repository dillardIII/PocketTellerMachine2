Creating an advanced Python module with intelligent recursion can be a fascinating endeavor. We will design a module named `ptm_intelligent_recursion` that will focus on implementing recursive algorithms with enhancements, such as memoization, dynamic problem-solving capabilities, and customizable stopping conditions. Below is an example of how this module could be structured:

```python
# ptm_intelligent_recursion.py

class Memoization:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}

    def memoize(self, func):
        def wrapper(*args):
            if args in self.cache:
                return self.cache[args]
            result = func(*args)
            self.cache[args] = result
            return result
        return wrapper
    
    
class IntelligentRecursion:
    def __init__(self, stop_checker=None):
        """
        Initialize the intelligent recursion class.
        
        :param stop_checker: A lambda/function that takes the current state and returns 
                             a boolean indicating whether the recursion should terminate.
        """
        self.stop_checker = stop_checker

    def recursive_solver(self, func, args, depth=0, max_depth=None):
        """
        Solve a problem recursively with intelligent stopping conditions.

        :param func: The function to solve recursively.
        :param args: The arguments to pass to the function.
        :param depth: Current recursion depth.
        :param max_depth: Maximum allowed recursion depth.
        :return: Solution to the problem.
        """
        if self.stop_checker and self.stop_checker(args):
            return None
        
        if max_depth is not None and depth > max_depth:
            raise RecursionError("Maximum recursion depth exceeded.")
        
        return func(args)

# Example usage of the module

def factorial(n):
    """A simple recursive function to calculate factorial."""
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize memoization
    memoization = Memoization()
    factorial_memoized = memoization.memoize(factorial)
    
    # Initialize intelligent recursion with a stop condition
    intelligent_recursion = IntelligentRecursion(stop_checker=lambda x: x < 0)
    
    try:
        # Solve factorial with memoization and intelligent recursion
        n = 5
        result = intelligent_recursion.recursive_solver(factorial_memoized, n)
        print(f"Factorial of {n} is {result}")
    except RecursionError as e:
        print(str(e))
```

### Key Features:

1. **Memoization**: A class is created to add memoization capability to any recursive function, which can help optimize recursive calls by avoiding recalculations of previously computed results.

2. **Intelligent Recursion**: Incorporates intelligent stopping conditions, which allows custom behavior for ending recursion based on the problem's requirements. The `stop_checker` is a user-defined function that provides this condition.

3. **Configurable Depth Limit**: The `recursive_solver` method allows setting a `max_depth` to prevent stack overflow scenarios with unbounded recursion.

### Usage Notes:

- **Memoization Enhancements**: Memoization can significantly improve the performance of recursive algorithms on complex tasks such as Fibonacci sequence calculation or solving dynamic programming problems like the Knapsack problem.

- **Stopping Conditions**: The example includes an intelligent stopping condition that can halt recursion for invalid input (e.g., negative factorial).

When integrating this module with the "PTM empire," developers can customize and expand the functionalities further, adding additional utilities to cater to specific problem-solving needs, such as dynamically constructing recursion trees or handling asynchronous recursion scenarios.
