Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably an acronym; please specify for better context) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves several considerations. To make the module robust and future-proof, we should focus on defining a system that can learn, adapt, and improve its self-governing capabilities. Here's a high-level outline with some innovative and recursive strategies:

### Module Overview
1. **Core Components**:
   - **Learning Engine**: Uses machine learning models to continuously evolve.
   - **Decision-Making Layer**: Implements sophisticated algorithms to make self-driven decisions.
   - **Feedback Loop System**: Captures the outcome of decisions to refine future actions.
   - **Security Protocols**: Ensures the system operates within safe parameters.
   - **Communication Interfaces**: Facilitates interaction with other modules and systems.

2. **Innovative Recursive Strategies**:
   - **Recursive Learning**: A self-improving model that refines its learning algorithm based on previous experiences.
   - **Multi-layered Feedback Loops**: Utilizes both short-term and long-term feedback for continuous optimization.
   - **Hierarchical Decision Trees**: Allows for recursive decision making, enabling the system to break down complex decisions into simpler, recursive sub-decisions.
   - **Self-Diagnosis and Repair**: Identifies anomalies or inefficiencies and applies recursive strategies to troubleshoot and correct the issues autonomously.

### Sample Module Structure

```python
# ptm_autonomy_stack.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from typing import Any, Dict

class PTMAutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier()
        self.data = []
        self.decisions = []
        self.feedback = []

    def collect_data(self, new_data: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Collect data for learning."""
        self.data.append(new_data)
        print("Data Collected:", new_data)

    def recursive_learning(self):
        """Learn recursively from past experiences."""
        if self.data:
            X, y = self._prepare_dataset()
            self.model.fit(X, y)
            print("Model trained with current dataset. Ready for decision making.")

    def _prepare_dataset(self):
        """Prepare data for training the model."""
        X = np.array([list(d.values())[:-1] for d in self.data])
        y = np.array([d['outcome'] for d in self.data])
        return X, y

    def make_decision():> str:
        """Recursive decision-making process."""
        decision = self.model.predict([list(inputs.values())])
        self.decisions.append(decision)
        print("Decision Made:", decision)
        return decision

    def feedback_loop(self, decision: str, outcome: str):
        """Dynamic feedback loop to influence future decisions."""
        feedback_info = {'decision': decision, 'outcome': outcome}
        self.feedback.append(feedback_info)
        print("Feedback Received:", feedback_info)
        self.recursive_learning()

    def hierarchical_decision_tree(self, complex_decision: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Breaks down a complex decision into simpler recursive decisions."""
        for key, value in complex_decision.items():
            print(f"Processing {key}: {value}")
            if isinstance(value, dict):
                self.hierarchical_decision_tree(value)
            else:
                print(f"Leaf Decision at {key}: {self.make_decision(value)}")

    def security_check(self):
        """Recursive security checks."""
        if not self.decisions:
            print("No decisions made yet. Skipping security check.")
        else:
            for decision in self.decisions:
                if self._is_secure(decision):
                    print("Decision secure:", decision)
                else:
                    self._resolve_security_issue(decision)

    def _is_secure():> bool:
        """Placeholder for security validation."""
        return True  # All decisions are secure for this example

    def _resolve_security_issue(self, decision: str):
        """Resolve potential security threats."""
        print("Resolving security issue with decision:", decision)
```

### Notes:
- **Modular Design**: The code is designed to be modular, allowing components to be expanded or replaced as needed.
- **Scalability**: You can integrate more complex machine learning models or decision-making algorithms as the system evolves.
- **Security and Feedback Integration**: Built-in feedback loops and security checks ensure adaptive learning and protection against anomalies.
- **Customization**: Depending on specific business needs, various parts of the structure can be customized or extended, like the model being used or how decisions are made.

This module serves as a foundational structure which can be expanded with additional functionalities, more sophisticated models, and additional recursive strategies to support the evolving needs of the PTM empire's autonomous systems.
