Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (let's assume "PTM" stands for "Predictive Technology Module") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves several key considerations. We need to design the module with recursive strategies to ensure it can adapt and improve its performance over time. Below is a conceptual outline and a basic implementation to get you started.

### Module Overview

The module, named `RecursiveAIEnhancer`, will focus on:

1. **Recursive Learning**: The ability to evaluate and recursively improve its predictive models.
2. **Autonomous Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automatically adjusting parameters for optimal performance.
3. **Self-monitoring and Adaptation**: Evaluating its own performance against real-world data and adjusting strategies accordingly.
4. **Integration with Existing Systems**: Ensuring compatibility and communication with the existing PTM infrastructure.

### Components

1. **Model Training Component**: Trains and evaluates models, employing recursive methods to iterate and improve.
2. **Evaluation Metrics**: A set of metrics to assess model performance and guide recursive enhancement.
3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Utilizes Bayesian optimization or genetic algorithms to refine model parameters in a recursive manner.
4. **Adaptation Layer**: Interfaces with external data sources and adapts model input to changing conditions.

### Basic Implementation

Here's a simplified Python module that showcases the recursive approach:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from scipy.optimize import minimize

class RecursiveAIEnhancer:
    def __init__(self, data, target, initial_params=None):
        self.data = data
        self.target = target
        self.model = RandomForestRegressor()
        if initial_params is None:
            initial_params = {'n_estimators': 100, 'max_depth': 10}
        self.params = initial_params

    def train_model(self):
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(self.data, self.target, test_size=0.2)
        self.model.set_params(**self.params)
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions = self.model.predict(X_test)
        return mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions), self.model

    def recursive_optimization(self):
        def objective(params):
            self.params = {'n_estimators': int(params[0]), 'max_depth': int(params[1])}
            mse, _ = self.train_model()
            return mse

        initial_guess = [self.params['n_estimators'], self.params['max_depth']]
        bounds = [(10, 200), (1, 20)]  # Define reasonable bounds for each parameter
        result = minimize(objective, initial_guess, bounds=bounds, method='L-BFGS-B')
        optimized_params = {'n_estimators': int(result.x[0]), 'max_depth': int(result.x[1])}
        self.params = optimized_params
        return optimized_params

    def run(self):
        prev_mse = float('inf')
        for _ in range(10):  # Limiting the recursive depth to 10 for demonstration
            mse, _ = self.train_model()
            if mse < prev_mse:
                self.recursive_optimization()
                prev_mse = mse
            else:
                print("Convergence achieved.")
                break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage with dummy data
    X = np.random.rand(1000, 20)
    y = np.random.rand(1000)

    enhancer = RecursiveAIEnhancer(X, y)
    enhancer.run()
```

### Key Features

- **Recursive Optimization**: The `recursive_optimization` method refines the model's hyperparameters using an objective function based on recursive evaluation strategies.
- **Adaptive Model Training**: The `train_model` method repeatedly trains and evaluates the model, ensuring it only updates if performance improves.
- **Limit on Recursion**: A limit or condition is set to prevent infinite loops, ensuring stability and convergence.

### Future Enhancements

This basic module can be further expanded to include:

- **Advanced Metrics**: Incorporate a broader range of metrics for more nuanced model evaluation.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Integration with streaming data sources for real-time adaptation.
- **Plug-and-Play Algorithms**: Allow swapping of underlying models and optimization techniques with minimal overhead.
- **Decentralized Autonomy**: Enable parts of the module to execute distributed across multiple nodes.

This module should serve as a foundation upon which more sophisticated recursive strategies can be developed, aligning with the PTM empire's goals of expanding its self-evolving autonomy stack.
