Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical autonomous system entity) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves integrating machine learning, artificial intelligence, and recursive strategies for continual system improvement. Below is an outlined conceptual design, including some key components and strategies. This modular architecture embraces modern AI concepts.

### PTM-Autonomy Stack Module (ptm_autonomy_stack)

#### Architecture Components

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**:
   - Manage multiple data streams.
   - Use Kafka or other stream processing frameworks to handle real-time data.

2. **Preprocessing Unit**:
   - Implement advanced preprocessing techniques using NumPy and Pandas for data transformation.
   - Leverage data augmentation and anomaly detection for robustness.

3. **Recursive Learning Model**:
   - Employ reinforcement learning with a multi-agent system.
   - Integrate novel recursive strategies where models are designed to improve upon themselves over iterations.

4. **Self-Evolution Engine**:
   - Use genetic algorithms or neuroevolution strategies to evolve model architectures automatically.
   - Allow dynamic hyperparameter tuning based on model performance.

5. **Knowledge Repository**:
   - Deploy a knowledge graph database such as Neo4j for storing insights and learned behaviors.
   - Encourage cross-sector learning by entailing a federated learning approach.

6. **Decision-Making Module**:
   - Utilize decision trees and Markov decision processes for structured decision-making.
   - Implement real-time context-aware decisions using fuzzy logic systems.

7. **Simulation & Testing Environment**:
   - Simulate environments using OpenAI Gym or Unity ML-Agents Toolkit.
   - Implement a feedback loop to continuously test, score, and inject learned strategies back into the system.

8. **Deployment & Monitoring Tools**:
   - Use Docker containers for modular deployment.
   - Implement Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring model health and system performance.
   
#### Recursive Strategies

- **Adaptive Learning Modules**:
  Utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers for temporal data. They allow recursive learning by processing sequences of data over time, improving predictions as more data is introduced.

- **Self-Reflective Agents**:
  Implement agents capable of self-assessment, identifying shortcomings in their strategies, and autonomously devising improvement plans.

- **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning**:
  Use hierarchical structures to decompose complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be recursively optimized.

- **Cascading Information Processing**:
  Design multi-level feedback loops where the output of one level is analyzed and factored into decision-making at the next level, improving over iterations.

#### Example Python Code Snippet

To give a taste of the module's design, below is an example snippet illustrating a basic recursive self-improvement loop:

```python
import numpy as np
from genetic_algo import GeneticAlgorithm  # Hypothetical module
from rl_environment import RLEnv  # Hypothetical module

class SelfEvolvingModel:
    def __init__(self, init_params):
        self.params = init_params
        self.env = RLEnv()
        self.gen_algo = GeneticAlgorithm()

    def train_model(self):
        scores = []
        for _ in range(100):
            score = self.env.run_simulation(self.params)
            scores.append(score)
            self.params = self.gen_algo.mutate(self.params, score)
        return np.mean(scores)

    def recursive_improve(self):
        performance_threshold = 0.9
        current_performance = 0.0
        while current_performance < performance_threshold:
            current_performance = self.train_model()
            print(f"Improved Performance: {current_performance}")

# Example usage
initial_params = {'learning_rate': 0.01, 'layers': [64, 32, 16]}
model = SelfEvolvingModel(init_params=initial_params)
model.recursive_improve()
```

In conclusion, this PTM autonomy stack module is designed to promote self-evolving behavior through recursive strategies, machine learning advancements, and a robust architectural framework. The module enables the PTM empire's systems to become more autonomous, adaptable, and capable of improving themselves over time.
