Designing a new Python module to expand PTM (Presumably a fictional or specific context not widely recognized) empireâ€™s self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies is an exciting challenge. In such a case, the module can capitalize on machine learning, optimization, and recursive principles to create a robust, autonomous system. Here's a conceptual framework for such a module:

### Module Name: `ptm_autonomy`

#### Features
1. **Recursive Learning Framework**: 
   - Implements recursive neural networks (RNNs) and recursive self-improvement algorithms.
   - Uses reinforcement learning to continuously evolve decision-making capabilities.

2. **Self-Optimization Algorithms**:
   - Genetic algorithms to evolve system configurations.
   - Recursive feature elimination for model optimization.
   - Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning.

3. **Dynamic Planning**:
   - Implements Model Predictive Control (MPC) with recursive updates for trajectory planning.
   - Recursive partitioning to adaptively split planning tasks.

4. **Multi-Agent Coordination**:
   - Recursive consensus algorithms for distributed, scalable decision-making.
   - Communication protocols to enable recursive data exchange among agents.

5. **Adaptive Sensory Processing**:
   - Recursive filtering techniques for noise reduction and data preprocessing.
   - Use of Recursive Bayesian Estimation for sensor fusion.

6. **Anomaly Detection and Correction**:
   - Recursive algorithms for anomaly detection in system state or inputs.
   - Implementation of Recursive Augmented Synthetic Control (RASC) for correction strategies.

# ptm_autonomy/adaptive_sensory.py
class SensoryProcessor:

### Key Considerations
- **Modularity**: Ensure that each component can be independently developed, tested, and integrated.
- **Scalability**: Design so that the framework naturally scales with the addition of more processing power or data.
- **Interoperability**: Ensure the system can integrate with existing PTM systems and technologies.
- **Safety and Fault Tolerance**: Implement checks and balances to ensure safe operation even in the learning phases.

This framework provides a comprehensive, innovative approach to creating a self-evolving autonomy stack for PTM or any organization looking to enhance their autonomous systems. As implementation progresses, further development into real-world deployment and integration with other systems will be crucial.
