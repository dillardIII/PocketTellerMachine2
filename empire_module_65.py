Creating an advanced Python module for an "unstoppable PTM empire" with a focus on intelligent recursion involves first understanding the domain you're working in and what exactly you want to achieve with recursion. Let's consider this imaginary PTM empire involves some complex data processing tasks that could benefit from a recursive approach.

Below is a hypothetical Python module named `ptm_recursion` that showcases intelligent recursion. This module could, for instance, tackle complex hierarchical data structures, efficiently solve recursive problems, and cache results for performance enhancements using memoization.

```python
import functools

class PTMDataProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize a cache for memoization
        self.cache = {}

    def intelligent_recursion(self, data_structure):
        """
        Public method to start the recursion process on a given hierarchical data structure.
        This method intelligently directs recursive calls based on the data type.
        """
        if isinstance(data_structure, dict):
            return self._process_dict(data_structure)
        elif isinstance(data_structure, list):
            return self._process_list(data_structure)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported data structure type")

    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def _process_dict(self, dictionary):
        """
        Recursively process a dictionary data structure. Implement caching to improve performance.
        """
        result = {}
        for key, value in dictionary.items():
            if isinstance(value, dict):
                result[key] = self._process_dict(value)
            elif isinstance(value, list):
                result[key] = self._process_list(tuple(value))  # cache lists as tuples
            else:
                result[key] = self._process_individual(value)
        return result

    def _process_list(self, lst):
        """
        Recursively process a list data structure.
        """
        result = []
        for item in lst:
            if isinstance(item, dict):
                result.append(self._process_dict(item))
            elif isinstance(item, list):
                result.append(self._process_list(item))
            else:
                result.append(self._process_individual(item))
        return result

    def _process_individual(self, item):
        """
        Process an individual item. Override this method for specific behavior.
        """
        # Placeholder for processing logic
        return item

# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    processor = PTMDataProcessor()
    complex_structure = {
        'a': [1, 2, {'b': 3, 'c': [4, 5]}, 6],
        'd': {'e': 7, 'f': {'g': 8, 'h': [9, {'i': 10}]}}
    }

    processed = processor.intelligent_recursion(complex_structure)
    print(processed)
```

### Key Features:
- **Intelligent Dispatch**: The method `intelligent_recursion` can differentiate between different data structures (like dicts and lists) and applies the appropriate recursive processing method.
- **Memoization**: The use of `functools.lru_cache` reduces the computational overhead by caching results of expensive function calls, though it mainly demonstrates potential caching of value transformation results.
- **Extendable**: The `_process_individual` method can be easily overridden to customize the processing of individual elements in the data structures, allowing for flexible and domain-specific logic.

### Usage:
To use this module, adjust the `_process_individual` method according to the specific processing needs of the PTM empire (e.g., converting data types, extracting specific information, applying complex transformations, etc.). Memoization strategies can also be tuned based on the complexity and specific requirements.

This design aims to serve as a flexible foundation for expanding processing capabilities across a variety of recursively-structured datasets typical in advanced data systems employed by enterprises like the hypothetical PTM empire.
