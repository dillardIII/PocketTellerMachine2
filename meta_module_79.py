Designing a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably, Post-Turing-Machine) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves several intricate steps. The key is to enable recursive learning and decision-making capabilities that are both efficient and adaptive. Here's a conceptual design to help you get started:

```python
# PTM_autonomy.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

class PTMAutonomy:
    """
    Class representing the self-evolving autonomy stack with recursive strategies.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.01, self_improvement_threshold=0.02):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.self_improvement_threshold = self_improvement_threshold
        
        # Initializing classifiers
        self.model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
        self.backup_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10)
        
        # State tracking
        self.performance_history = []
        self.current_state = None

    def initial_training(self, X, y):
        """
        Perform initial training of the model.
        """
        print("Starting initial training...")
        self.model.fit(X, y)
        print("Initial training complete.")

    def recursive_strategy(self, X, y):
        """
        Implement a recursive strategy for self-improvement.
        """
        print("Evaluating self-improvement possibilities...")
        prev_performance = self.evaluate_performance(X, y)
        
        # Backup current state
        self.backup_model.fit(X, y)
        
        # Simulate recursive self-evolution by refining the current model
        self.refine_model(X, y)

        # Evaluate performance of both models
        new_performance = self.evaluate_performance(X, y)
        
        improvement = new_performance - prev_performance
        print(f"Performance improvement: {improvement:.2%}")

        # Decide to retain changes based on improvement
        if improvement > self.self_improvement_threshold:
            print("Self-improvement threshold met. Retaining current model.")
        else:
            print("Insufficient improvement. Reverting to backup model.")
            self.model = self.backup_model

    def refine_model(self, X, y):
        """
        Refinement strategy to improve the current model.
        """
        print("Refining model...")
        # Implement tuning parameters or feature selection strategies as recursive improvements
        new_learning_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=15)
        new_learning_model.fit(X, y)
        self.model = new_learning_model

    def evaluate_performance(self, X, y):
        """
        Evaluate model performance, returning accuracy for simplicity.
        """
        predictions = self.model.predict(X)
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y, predictions)
        self.performance_history.append(accuracy)
        print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2%}")
        return accuracy

    def deploy(self):
        """
        Deploy the current model for production.
        """
        print("Deploying the model...")
        # Deployment logic and integration with the autonomous system


# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Simulated data
    X_train = np.random.rand(100, 5)
    y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=100)
    
    X_test = np.random.rand(20, 5)
    y_test = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=20)
    
    ptm_system = PTMAutonomy()
    ptm_system.initial_training(X_train, y_train)
    ptm_system.recursive_strategy(X_test, y_test)
    ptm_system.deploy()
```

### Key Features:

1. **Recursive Strategy**: By backing up the current state and using an alternative model for refinement, the module implements an inherent recursive system capable of comparing and retaining better-performing models.

2. **Self-improvement Threshold**: This threshold ensures that changes are significant enough to warrant keeping the modified model, ensuring stability while allowing for improvement.

3. **Performance Tracking**: The module keeps track of performance over time, which could be extended to trigger autonomous changes based on trends.

4. **Scalability**: Included RandomForest as a potential mechanism for refinement - this can be further enhanced with more sophisticated algorithms, feature selection methods or hyperparameter tuning.

This design serves as a foundational framework for building sophisticated autonomous systems capable of recursive self-improvement and can be expanded with additional machine learning approaches and deep learning capabilities.
