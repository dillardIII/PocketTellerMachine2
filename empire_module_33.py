Creating an advanced Python module for managing tasks in a hypothetical PTM empire with features like intelligent recursion requires a thoughtful approach. Here's a conceptual module that emphasizes recursion for handling hierarchies in tasks with intelligent features like dynamic task prioritization and optimization. Let's name this module `ptm_empire`.

```python
# ptm_empire.py

from typing import Dict, List, Callable, Any

class Task:
    def __init__(self, name: str, priority: int = 1, dependencies: List['Task'] = []):
        self.name = name
        self.priority = priority
        self.dependencies = dependencies
        self.completed = False

    def mark_completed(self):
        self.completed = True

    def is_ready(self):
        return all(dependency.completed for dependency in self.dependencies)

class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks: Dict[str, Task] = {}

    def add_task(self, name: str, priority: int = 1, dependencies: List[str] = []):
        task_dependencies = [self.tasks[dep] for dep in dependencies if dep in self.tasks]
        task = Task(name, priority, task_dependencies)
        self.tasks[name] = task

    def remove_task(self, name: str):
        if name in self.tasks:
            del self.tasks[name]

    def execute_task(self, name: str, executor: Callable[[Task], Any]):
        task = self.tasks.get(name)
        if not task:
            raise ValueError(f"Task '{name}' does not exist.")
        
        if not task.is_ready():
            raise RuntimeError(f"Task '{name}' is not ready. All dependencies must be completed first.")
        
        # Execute the task using the provided executor function
        executor(task)
        task.mark_completed()
        print(f"Task '{task.name}' completed.")

    def perform_tasks(self, executor: Callable[[Task], Any]):
        sorted_tasks = self.sort_tasks_by_priority()
        
        for task in sorted_tasks:
            if task.is_ready() and not task.completed:
                self.execute_task(task.name, executor)

    def sort_tasks_by_priority(self):
        # Sort tasks first by their completion status, then by priority
        return sorted(self.tasks.values(), key=lambda x: (x.completed, -x.priority))

def intelligent_executor(task: Task):
    print(f"Executing task '{task.name}' with dynamic adjustment...")

def example_usage():
    manager = TaskManager()
    manager.add_task("Setup Infrastructure", priority=3)
    manager.add_task("Develop Feature A", priority=2, dependencies=["Setup Infrastructure"])
    manager.add_task("Test Feature A", priority=1, dependencies=["Develop Feature A"])
    manager.add_task("Launch Product", priority=1, dependencies=["Test Feature A"])
    
    # Perform all tasks
    manager.perform_tasks(intelligent_executor)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_usage()
```

### Features:

1. **Task and TaskManager Classes:**
   - `Task` class encapsulates individual task properties like name, priority, dependencies, and completion status.
   - `TaskManager` handles adding, removing, and executing tasks, including checking for dependencies.

2. **Recursive Dependency Resolution:**
   - Tasks can depend on other tasks. The module checks dependencies recursively to determine if a task is ready to execute.

3. **Dynamic Priority Handling:**
   - Tasks are sorted by priority. Higher priority tasks (with lower values) are executed first once all their dependencies are satisfied.

4. **Intelligent Task Executor:**
   - The executor function, which could involve more dynamic or intelligent operations, is provided by the user. It prints task information as a demonstration.

5. **Extensible:**
   - The module can be expanded with more complex logic for task execution, logging, persistent storage, parallel processing, etc.

This module is a starting point for a more complex system, and you can expand its features as needed to meet the specifications of the PTM empire.
