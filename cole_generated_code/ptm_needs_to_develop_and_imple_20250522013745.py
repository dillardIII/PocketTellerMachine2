To develop and implement a variety of trading strategies, we would need to consider various factors such as technical indicators, historical data, and market trends. However, since you didn't provide specific details about the strategies you want to implement, I'll provide a simple example of a Python code implementing a basic moving average crossover strategy using the pandas library. 

This strategy involves two moving averages, one short-term (fast) and one long-term (slow). The basic idea is to buy when the fast moving average crosses above the slow moving average and sell when the fast moving average crosses below the slow moving average.

Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading strategies can be much more complex. Also, it's important to backtest any strategy before live trading.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = "AAPL"
data = yf.download(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2021-12-31")

# Calculate short-term (fast) moving average and long-term (slow) moving average
data['Fast_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()  # 10 days MA
data['Slow_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()  # 50 days MA

# Create a column for the trading signals
data['Signal'] = 0.0
data['Signal'][data['Fast_MA'] > data['Slow_MA']] = 1.0

# Generate trading orders
data['Order'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Print data
print(data)

# Note: A positive order suggests a buy signal and a negative order suggests a sell signal.
```

This code uses the `yfinance` library to download historical data for the desired ticker symbol. It then calculates the short-term and long-term moving averages and generates trading signals based on these averages. The 'Order' column in the resulting DataFrame indicates the trading orders: a positive order suggests a buy signal and a negative order suggests a sell signal.

Remember, this is a very basic strategy and in real-world scenarios, you would need to consider transaction costs, risk management, portfolio optimization, and many other factors.
