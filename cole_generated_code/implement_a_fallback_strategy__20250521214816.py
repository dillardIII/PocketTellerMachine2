Sure, here is a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found.

```python
def backtest_strategy(data):
    try:
        # Assuming backtest() is a function that performs backtesting on the data
        results = backtest(data)
        
        if not results:
            raise ValueError('No backtest results found')
            
        return results
    
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
        # Fallback strategy: return a default value or perform some other action
        return 'Fallback strategy activated'
```

In this function, we first try to perform backtesting on the data. If no results are found (i.e., the results are empty), we raise a ValueError. In the except block, we catch this ValueError and implement our fallback strategy. In this case, the fallback strategy is simply to print an error message and return a string indicating that the fallback strategy has been activated. You can replace this with any strategy you prefer.
