Sure, I can help you with that. However, I need more specific details to write the code. Here's a simple example of how you might track wins and losses in trading using Python. This is a very basic example and might not fit your specific needs.

```python
class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []
        
    def record_trade(self, amount):
        self.trades.append(amount)
        
    def get_wins_losses(self):
        wins = len([trade for trade in self.trades if trade > 0])
        losses = len([trade for trade in self.trades if trade < 0])
        return wins, losses

# Create a PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Record some trades
ptm.record_trade(100)  # Win
ptm.record_trade(-50)  # Loss
ptm.record_trade(200)  # Win
ptm.record_trade(-100)  # Loss

# Get wins and losses
wins, losses = ptm.get_wins_losses()
print(f"Wins: {wins}, Losses: {losses}")
```

In this example, a trade is considered a win if the amount is positive and a loss if it's negative. The `record_trade` method is used to record a trade, and the `get_wins_losses` method is used to get the number of wins and losses.

Please provide more details if you need a more specific solution.
