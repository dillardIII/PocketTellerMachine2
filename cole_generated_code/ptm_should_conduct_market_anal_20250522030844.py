To conduct market analysis, we need to have data first. We can get stock market data from various sources. For this example, I will use Yahoo Finance data which can be accessed using `yfinance` library in Python. 

Here is a simple Python code to get the data and perform basic analysis:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

# Download historical data as dataframe
def download_data(stock, start, end):
    data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(stock, start, end)
    return data

# Calculate moving average
def calculate_moving_average(data, period):
    data['SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=period).mean()
    return data['SMA']

# Identify potential trading opportunities
def identify_opportunities(data):
    buy_signals = []
    sell_signals = []
    for i in range(len(data)-1):
        if data['SMA'].iloc[i] > data['Close'].iloc[i] and data['SMA'].iloc[i+1] < data['Close'].iloc[i+1]:
            buy_signals.append(data.iloc[i+1].name)
        elif data['SMA'].iloc[i] < data['Close'].iloc[i] and data['SMA'].iloc[i+1] > data['Close'].iloc[i+1]:
            sell_signals.append(data.iloc[i+1].name)
    return buy_signals, sell_signals

# Define the stock and period
stock = 'AAPL'
start = '2020-01-01'
end = '2022-12-31'
period = 20

# Download the data
data = download_data(stock, start, end)

# Calculate the moving average
data['SMA'] = calculate_moving_average(data, period)

# Identify potential trading opportunities
buy_signals, sell_signals = identify_opportunities(data)

print('Buy signals: ', buy_signals)
print('Sell signals: ', sell_signals)
```

This script downloads the historical data of a stock (in this case, Apple Inc.), calculates the 20-day moving average, and identifies the potential buy and sell signals based on the moving average.

Please note that this is a very basic form of market analysis and actual trading decisions should not be made based on this analysis alone. More sophisticated methods would consider many other factors and use more complex algorithms.
