To initiate a trade, we need to interact with a trading API. Here's a simple example of how you could initiate a trade using the Alpaca API, a popular trading API that allows you to trade stocks. 

Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading involves more factors like risk management, strategy, etc.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Get account information
account = api.get_account()
print(account)

# Check if our account is restricted from trading.
if account.trading_blocked:
    print('Account is currently restricted from trading.')

# Check how much money we have to work with.
print('${} is available as cash'.format(account.cash))

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

In this example, replace `<APCA-API-KEY-ID>` and `<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>` with your actual API keys. This code will buy 1 share of Apple stock at the current market price.

Please note that this code will not run as is, because it requires a valid Alpaca API key and secret. Also, this code is for educational purposes only and should not be used for real trading without a proper understanding of the risks involved.
