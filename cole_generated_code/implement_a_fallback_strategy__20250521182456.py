Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This is a very basic example, and the fallback strategy simply prints a message and returns an empty dictionary. Depending on the specifics of your trading system, you may want to implement a more complex fallback strategy.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # Run the backtest for the given strategy
    # This is a placeholder implementation
    results = {}  # Replace with actual backtest implementation

    # If no results are found, implement fallback strategy
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Implement your fallback strategy here
        # In this example, we simply return an empty dictionary
        return {}

    # If results are found, return them
    return results

# Test the backtest function with a strategy
strategy = {}  # Replace with actual strategy
print(backtest(strategy))
```

In this code, `backtest` is a function that takes a trading strategy as input and returns the results of the backtest. If no results are found (i.e., if `results` is an empty dictionary), it prints a message and returns an empty dictionary as a fallback. If results are found, it returns them.

Please replace the placeholders with your actual backtest implementation and strategy.
