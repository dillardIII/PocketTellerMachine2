Sure, here's a simple Python code using the alpaca-trade-api module to initiate a trade. This code will buy 1 share of Apple stock. Please replace 'APCA-API-KEY-ID' and 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY' with your actual API keys.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Setup
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code will execute a trade on Alpaca's paper trading platform, which is a simulated trading environment. It's a great way to gain practical market experience without risking real money.

Please note that you need to install the alpaca-trade-api module. If it's not installed, you can do it using pip:

```bash
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Also, remember that trading involves risk, and this code does not implement any kind of risk management or investment strategy. It's important to understand what you're doing before trading with real money.
