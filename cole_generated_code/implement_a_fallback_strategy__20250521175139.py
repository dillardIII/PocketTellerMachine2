In Python, a simple way to implement a fallback strategy is by using control flow with a conditional statement like `if...else`. Here's an example of how you can code a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found:

```python
def backtest(trading_strategy):
    # Assume this function executes a backtest on a specific trading strategy (not implemented here)
    pass

def get_backtest_results(strategy):
    backtest_results = backtest(strategy)
    if backtest_results:
        return backtest_results
    else:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
        fallback_results = fallback_strategy()
        return fallback_results

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your fallback strategy code here, this might be a balanced/default strategy
    pass
```
Replace the `backtest` and `fallback_strategy` functions with their actual implementations. The `get_backtest_results` function will either return the backtest results, if they exist or it will return the results of the fallback strategy.

Note: The above code will not run on its own, it's a sample structure that you can use and customize according to your needs. The `backtest` and `fallback_strategy` functions should be replaced with the corresponding real functions.
