To analyze market trends and adjust trading approach, we need to use machine learning and data analysis techniques. Here is a simple example of how you might use Python to analyze market trends. This example uses the pandas library to analyze data and sklearn to create a simple predictive model.

Please note that this is a very basic example. Real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Load market data
# This data should contain information about market trends
# For example, it could be a CSV file with columns for date, opening price, closing price, etc.
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Preprocess the data
# This step depends on the format of your data
# In this example, we'll just use the opening price as our input and try to predict the closing price
X = data['Opening Price'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = data['Closing Price'].values.reshape(-1,1)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use our model to predict the closing price
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy of our model
print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))
print('Mean Squared Error:', metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
print('Root Mean Squared Error:', np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)))

# If the error is small, we can use this model to adjust our trading approach
# For example, if the predicted closing price is higher than the current price, we might want to buy
```

This is a very basic example and might not work well in practice. In reality, you would need to consider many more factors, such as volume, volatility, and the performance of other stocks. You might also want to use a more sophisticated model, such as a neural network or a time series model.
