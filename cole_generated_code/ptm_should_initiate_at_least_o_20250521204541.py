Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade. This code doesn't connect to any real trading platform, it's just a simulation. 

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000
        self.trades = []

    def initiate_trade(self, trade, quantity):
        cost = trade.price * quantity
        if cost > self.balance:
            print("Not enough balance to initiate the trade.")
            return
        self.balance -= cost
        self.trades.append((trade, quantity))
        print(f"Trade initiated: Bought {quantity} of {trade.name} at {trade.price}")

    def close_trade(self, trade, quantity):
        if (trade, quantity) not in self.trades:
            print("No such trade to close.")
            return
        self.trades.remove((trade, quantity))
        price_now = trade.price * random.uniform(0.5, 1.5)  # simulate price change
        self.balance += price_now * quantity
        print(f"Trade closed: Sold {quantity} of {trade.name} at {price_now}. Balance is now {self.balance}")

ptm = PTM()
trade = Trade("Apple", 100)

ptm.initiate_trade(trade, 10)
ptm.close_trade(trade, 10)
```

In this code, we first create a `Trade` class to represent a trade, which has a name and a price. Then we create a `PTM` class to represent the trading system. It has a balance and a list of trades. We can initiate a trade by buying a certain quantity of a trade, and close a trade by selling it. The price of the trade can change when we close it, simulating the potential wins or losses.
