Here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this example, we will assume that the backtest function returns None when no results are found. We will then implement a fallback strategy that simply logs the event and returns a default value.

```python
import logging

def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your actual backtest function
    # It should return the results of the backtest, or None if no results were found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    logging.warning("No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy.")
    # This is a placeholder for your actual fallback strategy
    # It should return a default value that can be used when no backtest results are found
    return "Default Value"

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        results = fallback_strategy()
    return results
```

This code will first try to execute the backtest function with the given strategy. If the backtest function returns None (indicating that no results were found), it will then execute the fallback strategy and use its return value instead. The execute_strategy function will then return the results of either the backtest or the fallback strategy, depending on which one was used.
