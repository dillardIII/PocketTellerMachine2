Sure, I can help you write a simple Python code that simulates a trade using a fictional stock market. This code will not actually initiate a real trade, but it will give you an idea of how trading algorithms work.

```python
import random

class Stock:
    def __init__(self, price, symbol):
        self.price = price
        self.symbol = symbol

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance
        self.stocks = {}

    def buy(self, stock):
        if self.balance > stock.price:
            self.balance -= stock.price
            if stock.symbol in self.stocks:
                self.stocks[stock.symbol] += 1
            else:
                self.stocks[stock.symbol] = 1
            print(f"Bought stock {stock.symbol} at price {stock.price}. Current balance: {self.balance}")
        else:
            print("Not enough balance to buy the stock")

    def sell(self, stock):
        if stock.symbol in self.stocks and self.stocks[stock.symbol] > 0:
            self.stocks[stock.symbol] -= 1
            self.balance += stock.price
            print(f"Sold stock {stock.symbol} at price {stock.price}. Current balance: {self.balance}")
        else:
            print("You don't own this stock")

# Create a PTM instance with initial balance of 10000
ptm = PTM(10000)

# Create some stocks
stocks = [Stock(random.randint(50, 200), f'Stock{i}') for i in range(1, 6)]

# Buy and sell some stocks
for stock in stocks:
    ptm.buy(stock)

for stock in stocks:
    ptm.sell(stock)
```

This code creates a PTM (Portfolio Trading Model) with an initial balance. It then creates some stocks with random prices. The PTM then buys and sells these stocks, updating its balance and stock holdings accordingly.
