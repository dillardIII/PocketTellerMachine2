Sure, here is a simple Python code that uses the `yfinance` library to download stock data, which can be used to assess the market's behavior. Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading systems are much more complex and involve risk management, portfolio optimization, etc.

```python
import yfinance as yf

def gather_data(ticker):
    # Download stock data
    data = yf.download(ticker, start='2021-01-01', end='2022-12-31')
    return data

def initiate_trade(ticker):
    # Gather data
    data = gather_data(ticker)
    
    # For simplicity, let's say we initiate a trade if the latest close price is higher than the previous close price
    if data['Close'][-1] > data['Close'][-2]:
        print(f"Initiating a BUY trade for {ticker}")
    else:
        print(f"Initiating a SELL trade for {ticker}")

# Test the function
initiate_trade('AAPL')
```

This code will print a message indicating whether a buy or sell trade is being initiated for the specified stock ticker based on a simple rule. Please replace `'AAPL'` with the ticker symbol of the stock you are interested in.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading systems are much more complex and involve risk management, portfolio optimization, etc. Also, this code does not actually execute any trades, it only simulates the decision-making process. To execute trades, you would need to use a trading API such as Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, etc.
