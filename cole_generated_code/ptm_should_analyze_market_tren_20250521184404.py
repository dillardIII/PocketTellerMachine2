Creating a Python script to analyze market trends and patterns is a complex task that involves a lot of data analysis and machine learning. Here is a very basic example of how you could start to approach this using the pandas and yfinance libraries to get stock data, and then calculating simple moving averages to identify potential trading opportunities. 

This code does not make actual trades, it just identifies potential opportunities based on the moving averages.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

# Use yfinance while pandas_datareader is being fixed
yf.pdr_override()

# Input the stock symbol
stock = input("Enter a stock symbol: ")

# Get the data for the stock
data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(stock, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

# Calculate the 20 day moving average
data['20_SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the 50 day moving average
data['50_SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a function to signal when to buy and sell an asset
def identify_opportunities(data):
    buy_list = []
    sell_list = []
    flag = -1

    for i in range(len(data)):
        if data['20_SMA'][i] > data['50_SMA'][i]:
            if flag != 1:
                buy_list.append(data['Close'][i])
                sell_list.append(np.nan)
                flag = 1
            else:
                buy_list.append(np.nan)
                sell_list.append(np.nan)
        elif data['20_SMA'][i] < data['50_SMA'][i]:
            if flag != 0:
                sell_list.append(data['Close'][i])
                buy_list.append(np.nan)
                flag = 0
            else:
                buy_list.append(np.nan)
                sell_list.append(np.nan)
        else:
            buy_list.append(np.nan)
            sell_list.append(np.nan)

    return (buy_list, sell_list)

# Add the buy and sell signals to the data
data['Buy_Signal_Price'] = identify_opportunities(data)[0]
data['Sell_Signal_Price'] = identify_opportunities(data)[1]

# Print the data
print(data)
```

This is a very basic script and should be used as a starting point. It does not take into account many factors that could influence trading decisions, such as volume, other technical indicators, news events, etc. Always do your own research before making trading decisions.
