Sure, here's a simple implementation of an EMA (Exponential Moving Average) Crossover Analyzer in Python using the `pandas` library. This script will calculate the EMA for two different periods (short and long) and then determine when the short period EMA crosses above or below the long period EMA.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def ema_crossover(data, short_window, long_window):
    short_ema = calculate_ema(data['Close'], short_window)
    long_ema = calculate_ema(data['Close'], long_window)

    data['Short EMA'] = short_ema
    data['Long EMA'] = long_ema

    data['Buy Signal'] = (short_ema > long_ema)
    data['Sell Signal'] = (short_ema < long_ema)

    return data

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate EMA crossover
ema_crossover_data = ema_crossover(data, 12, 26)

# Print data
print(ema_crossover_data)
```

This script uses the `yfinance` library to download historical price data for a specific ticker symbol (in this case, 'AAPL' for Apple Inc.). It then calculates the EMA crossover using a short window of 12 periods and a long window of 26 periods, which are common parameters for EMA crossover analysis. The resulting DataFrame includes columns for the short EMA, long EMA, and buy/sell signals.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and may not be suitable for all use cases. For example, it doesn't take into account trading fees or slippage, and it assumes that you can trade at the closing price of each period, which may not be realistic. Also, it doesn't implement any kind of stop loss or take profit strategy. You may need to modify this script to better suit your needs.
