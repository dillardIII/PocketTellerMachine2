Sure, here's how you can implement a fallback strategy in Python for when no backtest results are found:

```python
def fallback_strategy(backtest_results):
    """Fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found."""
    if not backtest_results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy...")
        # Placeholder for fallback strategy
        # You can add code here for your fallback strategy such as notifying the user, re-running the test, etc.
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")
        # Process backtest results here

# For testing
# An empty list for backtest results
backtest_results = []
fallback_strategy(backtest_results)
```

In this example, the `fallback_strategy()` function checks if the `backtest_results` list is empty. If it's empty (indicating no backtest results), it prints a message and implements a fallback strategy. In this case, the fallback strategy is just a placeholder comment. You can replace it with code to perform any required actions when no backtest results are found (e.g., sending a notification, rerunning the backtest, etc.).
