Sure, here is a simple example of how you might initiate a trade using the Alpaca API, a popular trading API for Python. This example will buy 1 share of Apple stock.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Replace these with your API connection info
APCA_API_BASE_URL = 'https://paper-api.alpaca.markets'
APCA_API_KEY_ID = 'your_key_id'
APCA_API_SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'

api = tradeapi.REST(APCA_API_KEY_ID, APCA_API_SECRET_KEY, APCA_API_BASE_URL, api_version='v2')

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

Please note that this is a very simple example and doesn't include any error handling or other important features you would likely want in a real trading system. Also, you would need to replace 'your_key_id' and 'your_secret_key' with your actual Alpaca API key and secret.

Once the trade is made, you can gather data and evaluate performance. Here is a simple example of how you might get the last 100 trades for a specific stock and calculate the average price:

```python
# Get the last 100 trades for AAPL
trades = api.get_trades('AAPL', limit=100)

# Calculate the average price
average_price = sum(trade.price for trade in trades) / len(trades)

print(f'The average price for the last 100 trades is {average_price}')
```

Again, this is a very simple example and doesn't include any error handling or other important features.
