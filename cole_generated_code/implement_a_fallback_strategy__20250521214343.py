Sure, I can help you with that. However, I need more context to provide a more accurate code. For now, let's assume that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that returns backtest results, and if no results are found, it returns `None`. Here's a simple fallback strategy:

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest logic here
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")
    # Your fallback strategy logic here
    pass

def main():
    backtest_results = run_backtest()
    if backtest_results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found. Proceeding with normal strategy...")
        # Your normal strategy logic here
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, if `run_backtest()` returns `None`, the `fallback_strategy()` function is called. Otherwise, the program proceeds with the normal strategy. You would replace the `pass` statements with your actual logic.
