Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a simple example of a Python script that could be used to implement a basic trading strategy. This strategy will use Moving Average Crossover, which is a common algorithmic trading strategy.

Please note that this script assumes that you have historical stock price data available in a pandas DataFrame. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    sma = data.rolling(window=window).mean()
    return sma

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    ema = data.ewm(span=window).mean()
    return ema

def trading_strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    # Calculate the short and long window simple moving averages
    data['short_sma'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], short_window)
    data['long_sma'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], long_window)

    # Create a column 'Signal' such that if the short window SMA is greater than long window SMA then set Signal as 1 else 0
    data['Signal'] = 0.0  
    data['Signal'][short_window:] = np.where(data['short_sma'][short_window:] > data['long_sma'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   

    # Create a column 'Position' which is a day-to-day difference of the 'Signal' column
    data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()
    
    return data

def implement_strategy():
    # Define the ticker list
    tickers = ['AAPL']

    # Fetch the data
    for ticker in tickers:
        data = web.DataReader(ticker, 'yahoo', start='01-01-2015', end='31-12-2020')
        final_data = trading_strategy(data, 50, 200)
        
    # Print the data
    print(final_data)

implement_strategy()
```

In this script, we first calculate the short and long window simple moving averages (SMA). Then, we create a 'Signal' column such that if the short window SMA is greater than the long window SMA then we set Signal as 1 (indicating buying the stock) else 0 (indicating selling the stock). Finally, we create a 'Position' column which is a day-to-day difference of the 'Signal' column.

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and might not be profitable in real trading. It's always recommended to backtest any strategy before live trading. Also, this script doesn't include transaction costs.

You would also need to install `pandas_datareader` library which can be installed via pip:

```sh
pip install pandas_datareader
```

Make sure to replace `'AAPL'` with the symbol of the stock you want to trade, and adjust the start and end dates as per your needs.
