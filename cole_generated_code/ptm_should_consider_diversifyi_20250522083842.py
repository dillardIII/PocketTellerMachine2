To diversify a portfolio, you would need to spread your investments across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, etc. However, writing Python code for this task would require specific data about the current portfolio, the risk tolerance, the investment goals, and the market conditions. 

Here is a simple example of how you might start to diversify a portfolio using Python. This code uses the pandas library to create a DataFrame representing a portfolio, and then calculates the percentage of the portfolio's total value that each asset represents. 

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame representing the current portfolio
portfolio = pd.DataFrame({
    'Asset': ['Stock A', 'Stock B', 'Stock C', 'Bond A', 'Bond B'],
    'Value': [10000, 15000, 20000, 25000, 30000]
})

# Calculate the total value of the portfolio
total_value = portfolio['Value'].sum()

# Calculate the percentage of the total value that each asset represents
portfolio['Percentage'] = portfolio['Value'] / total_value * 100

print(portfolio)
```

This is a very basic example and does not take into account many important factors that would need to be considered in a real-world scenario. For a more comprehensive solution, you would likely want to use a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving machine learning or other advanced techniques, and you would definitely want to consult with a financial advisor or other expert.
