Sure, I can help with that. However, I need to know what the fallback strategy should be. For instance, should it return a default value, raise an exception, or perform some other action? 

Assuming we want to return a default value, here's a simple example of how you might implement this in Python:

```python
def get_backtest_results(backtest_id):
    # This is a placeholder for the code that would normally fetch your backtest results.
    # In a real implementation, this would likely involve a database query or API request.
    # For this example, we'll just return None to simulate a situation where no results are found.
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is where you would define your fallback strategy.
    # For this example, we'll just return a default value.
    return "No backtest results found."

def get_results_with_fallback(backtest_id):
    results = get_backtest_results(backtest_id)
    if results is None:
        return fallback_strategy()
    else:
        return results

# Test the function
print(get_results_with_fallback("123"))
```

In this example, if `get_backtest_results` returns `None` (indicating that no results were found), the `get_results_with_fallback` function will instead return the result of `fallback_strategy`.

Please replace the placeholder code with your actual code to fetch backtest results and implement your fallback strategy.
