To conduct market research for trading opportunities, we can use APIs like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance to fetch real-time and historical market data. Then we can use Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python, to analyze this data.

Here's a simple example of how you can fetch and analyze data from Yahoo Finance. In this example, we will fetch historical data for a specific stock and calculate its moving average.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading strategies can be much more complex.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'
ticker_data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate the short-term/simple moving average
ticker_data['SMA_20'] = ticker_data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-term/simple moving average
ticker_data['SMA_50'] = ticker_data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a column to hold the trade signals
ticker_data['Signal'] = 0.0
ticker_data['Signal'][ticker_data['SMA_20'] > ticker_data['SMA_50']] = 1.0

# Generate trading orders
ticker_data['Position'] = ticker_data['Signal'].diff()

# Print the DataFrame
print(ticker_data)
```

In this example, a buy signal is generated when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, and a sell signal is generated when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.

Please note that this is a very simplistic trading strategy and it's used for illustrative purposes. Real-world trading strategies should consider many other factors and use more sophisticated algorithms. Also, this script does not include any risk management or portfolio optimization techniques, which are crucial for successful trading.

Before running the script, make sure to install the necessary libraries by running `pip install pandas yfinance` in your command line.
