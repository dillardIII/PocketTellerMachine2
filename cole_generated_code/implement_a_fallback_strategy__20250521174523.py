Sure, I'd be happy for a chance to demonstrate Python code addressing your request. Let's suppose you're using a function called `get_backtest_results()` to fetch your backtest results. If the result is `None`, you'll want to execute a fallback strategy.

Here's a simple example of how you might do this:

```Python
def get_fallback_strategy():
    # Implementation of your fallback strategy
    pass

def main():
    backtest_results = get_backtest_results()

    if backtest_results is None:
        print('No backtest results found. Implementing the fallback strategy...')
        get_fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print('Backtest results:', backtest_results)

def get_backtest_results():
    # Your code to fetch backtest results
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This is a very simplified version of what your code might look like. Of course, you would need to replace both `get_backtest_results()` and `get_fallback_strategy()` with your actual functions. I hope this gives you a general idea though. Let me know if you need further help!
