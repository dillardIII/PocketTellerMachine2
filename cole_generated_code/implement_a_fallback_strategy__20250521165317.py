Sure, I can help with that. Here's a sample Python code that handles situations where no backtest results are found.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
  try:
    # Assume that 'run_backtest' is the function that initiates your backtesting
    results = run_backtest(strategy)
  
    if not results:
      raise Exception('No backtest results found')
  
    # Continue with the rest of code here
    # ...
  
  except Exception as e:
    print("Exception Occurred: ", e)

    # Implement the fallback strategy here
    print("Implementing Fallback Strategy...")
  
    fallback_strategy = "fallback_strategy" # define the fallback strategy 
    fallback_results = run_backtest(fallback_strategy)

    if not fallback_results:
      print("Fallback strategy also Failed!")
    else:
      print("Fallback strategy executed successfully!")
      # Continue with fallback results
      # ...

```
In the above Python script, `run_backtest` function initiates your backtesting and returns the results. If the results are not found (results are probably None or an empty list depending on how your system works), an Exception is raised which goes to the corresponding except block where fallback strategy is implemented. 

Please replace the `run_backtest`,  `strategy`, and `fallback_strategy` accordingly to fit into your project structure. Also, replace the print statements with the actual logic that should be there as per your project requirement.
