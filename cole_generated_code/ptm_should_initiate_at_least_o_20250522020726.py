Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trading bot. This bot will initiate at least one trade. Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading bots require complex algorithms and security measures.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance

    def trade(self):
        # Randomly decide whether to buy or sell
        action = random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])

        # Randomly decide the amount to trade
        amount = random.randint(1, 10)

        if action == 'buy':
            # If buying, check if we have enough balance
            if self.balance >= amount:
                self.balance -= amount
                print(f'Bought {amount} units. Remaining balance: {self.balance}')
            else:
                print('Not enough balance to buy')
        else:
            # If selling, just sell (we're not keeping track of owned units in this simple example)
            self.balance += amount
            print(f'Sold {amount} units. New balance: {self.balance}')

# Create a PTM with a balance of 100
ptm = PTM(100)

# Initiate a trade
ptm.trade()
```

This code creates a simple trading bot that randomly decides whether to buy or sell, and randomly decides the amount to trade (between 1 and 10). If the bot decides to buy, it checks if it has enough balance. If it does, it decreases the balance by the amount bought. If it doesn't, it prints a message saying it doesn't have enough balance. If the bot decides to sell, it just increases the balance by the amount sold.
