Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Run backtest
    backtest_results = strategy.run_backtest()

    # Check if backtest results are empty
    if not backtest_results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        fallback_strategy = FallbackStrategy()
        fallback_results = fallback_strategy.run_backtest()

        # If fallback strategy also fails, raise an exception
        if not fallback_results:
            raise Exception("Fallback strategy also failed. Please check your strategies.")
        
        return fallback_results

    return backtest_results
```

In this code, `strategy` and `FallbackStrategy` are assumed to be objects of some classes that have a method `run_backtest()`. This method is supposed to return the backtest results. If the results are empty (which is checked by `if not backtest_results:`), a fallback strategy is implemented. If the fallback strategy also fails, an exception is raised.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of your `Strategy` classes and the specific requirements of your project.
