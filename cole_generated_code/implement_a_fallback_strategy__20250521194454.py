Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This is a very basic example and the fallback strategy just prints a message, but you could replace this with any action you want.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    # This function should return the backtest results
    # For now, it returns None to simulate no results found
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function defines the fallback strategy
    # In this case, it just prints a message
    print("No backtest results found. Applying fallback strategy...")

def main():
    # Get the backtest results
    backtest_results = get_backtest_results()

    # If no results are found, apply the fallback strategy
    if backtest_results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found. Proceeding with normal strategy...")

# Run the main function
main()
```

In this code, the `get_backtest_results()` function is supposed to return the backtest results. For now, it returns `None` to simulate a scenario where no results are found. The `fallback_strategy()` function defines the fallback strategy. In this case, it just prints a message, but you could replace this with any action you want. The `main()` function gets the backtest results and applies the fallback strategy if no results are found.
