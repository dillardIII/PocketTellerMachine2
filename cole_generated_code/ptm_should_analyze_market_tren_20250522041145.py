To analyze market trends and adjust trading approach, we can use machine learning algorithms. Here is a simple example of how you could use Python to analyze market trends using a linear regression model from the sklearn library. This is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Assume we have a CSV file 'market_data.csv' with 'Date' and 'Price' columns
df = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Convert 'Date' to datetime
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Set 'Date' as index
df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Convert index to integer (number of days since 1970-01-01)
df.index = (df.index - pd.Timestamp("1970-01-01")) // pd.Timedelta('1D')

# Prepare data for training
X = df.index.values.reshape(-1,1)
y = df['Price'].values.reshape(-1,1)

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()  
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the model to predict 'Price'
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy of the model
print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))  
print('Mean Squared Error:', metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))  
print('Root Mean Squared Error:', np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)))

# If the error is small, we can use this model to predict future prices and adjust our trading approach
```

This code will give you a basic idea of how to analyze market trends using Python. However, keep in mind that this is a very simplified model. Real-world trading models use much more complex algorithms and take into account many more factors.
