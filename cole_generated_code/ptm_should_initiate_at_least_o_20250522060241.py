Sure, I can provide a simple Python code that simulates a trade. However, please note that this is a very basic example and real trading involves much more complex strategies and risk management. Also, it's important to remember that trading in financial markets involves risk, and this should not be taken as trading advice.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # initial balance
        self.current_strategy = 'random'  # current trading strategy

    def trade(self):
        if self.current_strategy == 'random':
            trade_result = random.choice(['win', 'lose'])
            if trade_result == 'win':
                self.balance += 100
            else:
                self.balance -= 100
        else:
            print("Unknown strategy")
            return

        print(f"After trade, balance is: {self.balance}")
        return trade_result

ptm = PTM()
trade_result = ptm.trade()

print(f"Trade result: {trade_result}")
```

In this code, a PTM (Pretend Trading Machine) object is created with an initial balance of 10000 and a trading strategy of 'random'. The `trade` method simulates a trade based on the current strategy. If the strategy is 'random', it randomly chooses a 'win' or 'lose' outcome for the trade. If the trade is a 'win', it adds 100 to the balance, and if it's a 'lose', it subtracts 100. After the trade, it prints the new balance. The result of the trade is also printed at the end.

In a real-world scenario, the trading strategy would be much more complex and would likely involve analyzing market data, making predictions based on machine learning models, managing risk, etc.
