Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the program will print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume we have a function `run_backtest` that returns backtest results
    # If no results are found, it returns None
    results = run_backtest(strategy)

    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Falling back to default strategy.")
        # Fallback strategy: return an empty dictionary
        return {}

    return results

def run_backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for the actual backtest implementation
    # In the real implementation, you would run the backtest and return the results
    # If no results are found, you would return None
    pass
```

Please note that this is a very basic example. The actual implementation would depend on the specifics of your trading system and what you want the fallback strategy to do.
