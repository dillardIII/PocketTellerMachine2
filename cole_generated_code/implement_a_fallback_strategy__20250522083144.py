Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    try:
        # Run backtest
        results = strategy.run_backtest()
        
        # If no results found, raise an exception
        if not results:
            raise Exception("No backtest results found.")
            
        return results
    except Exception as e:
        print(str(e))
        
        # Fallback strategy
        print("Running fallback strategy...")
        fallback_results = strategy.run_fallback()
        
        return fallback_results

# Assuming you have a Strategy object
strategy = Strategy()
backtest_strategy(strategy)
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` is a method of the `Strategy` class that runs the backtest and returns the results. If the results are empty, an exception is raised.

When an exception is caught, the fallback strategy is run instead by calling `run_fallback()`, another method of the `Strategy` class.

Please note that this is a simple example and the actual implementation may vary based on the details of your `Strategy` class and how you want to handle fallbacks.
