To analyze market trends and adjust strategies, we need historical market data. Python has several libraries like pandas, numpy for data analysis and manipulation, and libraries like yfinance to fetch historical market data. We can use machine learning to predict future trends.

Here is a simple example of how you can fetch market data and analyze it. Note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading systems are much more complex and involve more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 

# Fetch historical market data
data = yf.download('AAPL','2020-01-01','2022-12-31')

# Calculate the moving average
data['SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=14).mean()

# Calculate the standard deviation
data['STD'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=14).std() 

# Create a 'Buy_Signal' column
data['Buy_Signal'] = data['SMA'] - (2 * data['STD']) 

# Create a 'Sell_Signal' column
data['Sell_Signal'] = data['SMA'] + (2 * data['STD'])

# Prepare data for model training
X = data[['SMA', 'STD']].values
y = data['Close'].values

# Split the dataset into 80% training data and 20% testing data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the model to predict 'Close' prices
predicted_prices = model.predict(X_test)

# Print the predicted prices
print(predicted_prices)
```

This script fetches historical market data for the Apple Inc. stock, calculates the moving average and standard deviation, creates buy and sell signals, and uses a linear regression model to predict future 'Close' prices.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world trading strategies are much more complex and involve more factors. Also, this script doesn't actually execute any trades, it just analyzes market data and makes predictions. To execute trades, you would need to use a trading API.
