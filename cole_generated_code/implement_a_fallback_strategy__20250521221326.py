Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the fallback strategy is to simply return a message stating that no results were found.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume this function returns backtest results
    results = get_backtest_results(strategy)
    
    if not results:
        return fallback_strategy()
    else:
        return results

def get_backtest_results(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder function. In real use, this would contain code to get backtest results.
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Please revise your strategy.")
    return None
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results(strategy)` is a placeholder function. In a real-world scenario, this function would contain the code to get the backtest results for a given strategy. If no results are found (i.e., if `get_backtest_results(strategy)` returns `None` or an empty list), the `fallback_strategy()` function is called.

Please replace `get_backtest_results(strategy)` with your actual function to get backtest results. Also, you can modify `fallback_strategy()` according to your needs. For example, you might want to return a default set of results, or you might want to raise an exception.
