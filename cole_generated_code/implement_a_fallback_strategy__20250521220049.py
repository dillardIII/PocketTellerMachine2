Sure, I can provide you with a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. Here's a basic example:

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume this function performs backtesting and returns the results
    # If no results, it returns None
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function implements the fallback strategy
    pass

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest_strategy(strategy)
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found. Executing main strategy...")
        # Execute main strategy with the obtained results
        # ...
```

In this code, `execute_strategy` function is the main function that executes a trading strategy. It first tries to backtest the strategy by calling `backtest_strategy` function. If no results are found (i.e., `backtest_strategy` returns `None`), it executes the fallback strategy by calling `fallback_strategy` function. If backtest results are found, it proceeds with the main strategy. 

Please note that the actual implementation of `backtest_strategy` and `fallback_strategy` functions would depend on the specifics of your trading system and strategies.
