Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This example assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs a backtest and returns the results, or `None` if no results are found.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    # Return results or None if no results found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your fallback strategy here
    print("Running fallback strategy...")
    pass

def main():
    backtest_results = run_backtest()

    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")
        # Process backtest results here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example, `run_backtest()` is called and its results are stored in `backtest_results`. If `backtest_results` is `None`, the fallback strategy is executed. Otherwise, the backtest results are processed as normal. 

Please replace the `pass` statement in `run_backtest` and `fallback_strategy` functions with your actual code.
