Below is a simple Python code that uses a variable `trading_volume` to represent PTM's current trading volume. The value of `trading_volume` is then increased by a certain percentage (in this case, 10%) to boost chances of recording wins and losses.

```python
# Initial trading volume
trading_volume = 100

# Percentage increase
percentage_increase = 0.1

# Increase trading volume
trading_volume += trading_volume * percentage_increase

print(f"New trading volume: {trading_volume}")
```

This code increases the trading volume by 10%. You can modify the percentage increase as required. Remember, increasing trading volumes also increases both the potential for bigger wins and risks of heavier losses.

This piece of code does not directly correlate with recording of wins and losses, as it doesn't include a method to perform or simulate trades, nor a way to record the results of those trades. The wins and losses depend on the success of the trades taken, which in turn depends on many factors like the trading strategy, the state of the market and so on.
