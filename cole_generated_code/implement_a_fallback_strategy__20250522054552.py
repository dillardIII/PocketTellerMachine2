Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found:

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    try:
        # Assume backtest() is a function that performs backtesting
        results = backtest(strategy)
        
        if not results:
            raise ValueError("No backtest results found")
            
        return results
    
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
        # Fallback strategy
        print("Implementing fallback strategy...")
        fallback_results = backtest("fallback_strategy")
        
        return fallback_results
```

In this code, we first try to backtest the given strategy. If no results are found (i.e., the results are None or an empty list), we raise a ValueError. In the except block, we catch this ValueError and implement the fallback strategy. We assume that "fallback_strategy" is a predefined strategy that we can use when the main strategy fails.
