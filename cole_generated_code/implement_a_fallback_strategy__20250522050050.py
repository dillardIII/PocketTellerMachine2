Sure, I can provide you with a basic example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. Here's a simple example:

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume this function performs backtest and returns results
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is your fallback strategy
    print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest_strategy(strategy)
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Assume this function applies the strategy based on backtest results
        apply_strategy(results)

# Call the function with a strategy
execute_strategy(my_strategy)
```

In this example, `backtest_strategy(strategy)` is a function that performs a backtest for a given strategy and returns the results. If no results are found (i.e., the function returns `None`), the `fallback_strategy()` function is called. If backtest results are found, the `apply_strategy(results)` function is called to apply the strategy based on the backtest results.

Please replace `backtest_strategy(strategy)`, `fallback_strategy()`, and `apply_strategy(results)` with your actual functions and logic.
