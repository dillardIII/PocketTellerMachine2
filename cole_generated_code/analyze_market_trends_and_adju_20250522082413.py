To analyze market trends and adjust trading parameters, we can use libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computation, matplotlib for visualization, and sklearn for machine learning. 

Here's a basic example of how you might start to approach this problem:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load market data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Analyze trends
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)
data['Price'].plot()
plt.show()

# Prepare data for machine learning
X = data.drop('Price', axis=1)
y = data['Price']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict future prices
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Adjust trading parameters based on predictions
# For example, if the predicted price is higher than the current price, buy more stocks
data['Predicted_Price'] = model.predict(X)
data['Buy_More'] = np.where(data['Predicted_Price'] > data['Price'], 'Yes', 'No')

print(data.head())
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider many more factors and use more sophisticated models to predict market trends. Also, the 'market_data.csv' file needs to be replaced with the actual data file you have. The data file should contain historical market data including dates and prices.
