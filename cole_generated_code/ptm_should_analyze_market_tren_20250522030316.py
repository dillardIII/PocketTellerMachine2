Building a Profitable Trade Model (PTM) that analyzes market trends and opportunities is a complex task that involves multiple steps and requires a deep understanding of both programming and financial markets. Here's a simplified example of how you might start building such a system using Python. 

This example uses the pandas library to analyze historical stock price data and the yfinance library to download the data from Yahoo Finance. The system calculates the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and uses it as a basic indicator for trading signals.

Please note that this is a very simplified model and should not be used for actual trading without further improvements.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    return data.rolling(window=window).mean()

def analyze_stock(symbol):
    # Download historical data as dataframe
    data = yf.download(symbol, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

    # Calculate 50-day SMA
    data['SMA_50'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], 50)

    # Calculate 200-day SMA
    data['SMA_200'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], 200)

    # Create a column with trading signals
    data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['SMA_50'] > data['SMA_200']).astype(int)
    data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['SMA_50'] < data['SMA_200']).astype(int)

    # Print data
    print(data)

# Analyze a specific stock
analyze_stock('AAPL')
```

This script downloads the historical price data for Apple's stock and calculates the 50-day and 200-day SMA. When the 50-day SMA is higher than the 200-day SMA, it generates a buy signal, and when it's lower, it generates a sell signal.

This is a very basic strategy and does not take into account many factors that could influence the profitability of the trades. For a real-world trading system, you would need to implement more complex strategies, consider transaction costs, and possibly use machine learning algorithms to predict future price movements.
