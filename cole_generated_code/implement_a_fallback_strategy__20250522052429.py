Sure, here's a simple example of how you could implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, I'll assume that the backtest function returns None when no results are found.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest function
    # It should return the backtest results if they exist, and None otherwise
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your fallback strategy
    # It should be implemented to do something useful when no backtest results are found
    print("No backtest results found, executing fallback strategy...")

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Do something with the results
        print("Backtest results found, executing strategy...")
```

In this example, the `execute_strategy` function first attempts to backtest a given strategy. If no results are found (i.e., the `backtest` function returns `None`), it executes the fallback strategy. Otherwise, it proceeds with the original strategy. 

Please replace the placeholder functions `backtest` and `fallback_strategy` with your actual implementation.
