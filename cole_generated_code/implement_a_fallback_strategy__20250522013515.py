Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. The fallback strategy could be anything you want, but in this example, I'm just printing a message and returning an empty dictionary.

```python
def get_backtest_results(backtest_id):
    # Simulating a function that fetches backtest results
    backtest_results = fetch_backtest_results(backtest_id)

    # If no backtest results are found
    if not backtest_results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy...")
        # Fallback strategy: return an empty dictionary
        return {}

    # If backtest results are found
    return backtest_results

def fetch_backtest_results(backtest_id):
    # This function is supposed to fetch backtest results
    # In this example, it's just returning None
    return None
```

In this example, `fetch_backtest_results` is a placeholder for a function that fetches backtest results. It always returns `None`, which simulates a scenario where no backtest results are found. 

You would replace `fetch_backtest_results` with your actual function for fetching backtest results, and replace the fallback strategy with whatever you want to do when no backtest results are found.
