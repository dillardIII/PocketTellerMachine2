To analyze market trends and patterns, we need historical market data. We can use libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis and visualization, and yfinance to download the market data. 

Here is a basic example of how you could implement this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = "AAPL"
data = yf.download(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

# Calculate moving averages
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Generate trading signals (buy=1 , sell=-1, do nothing=0)
data['Signal'] = 0
data.loc[(data['SMA_50'] > data['SMA_200']) & (data['SMA_50'].shift(-1) < data['SMA_200'].shift(-1)), 'Signal'] = 1
data.loc[(data['SMA_50'] < data['SMA_200']) & (data['SMA_50'].shift(-1) > data['SMA_200'].shift(-1)), 'Signal'] = -1

# Plot data
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label=ticker)
plt.plot(data['SMA_50'], label='SMA 50')
plt.plot(data['SMA_200'], label='SMA 200')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()

# Print potential trading opportunities
print(data[data['Signal'] != 0])
```

This script downloads historical data for the Apple stock, calculates 50 and 200-day moving averages, generates trading signals based on crossover strategy (buy when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average, sell when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average), and plots the closing price and moving averages.

Please note that this is a very simple strategy and might not be profitable in real trading. For a more sophisticated analysis, you might want to consider other factors like volume, other technical indicators, fundamental analysis, etc. Also, you might want to backtest your strategy before live trading.
