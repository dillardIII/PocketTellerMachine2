Sure, I'll write a Python function named `fallback_strategy` that will be called when no backtest results are found. This function will simply print a message to the console and return an empty dictionary. 

```python
def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Applying fallback strategy.")
    # Here you can implement your fallback strategy
    # For now, it just returns an empty dictionary
    return {}

# Let's assume we have a function get_backtest_results which returns backtest results
def get_backtest_results():
    # This function should return backtest results
    # For now, it returns None
    return None

# Main function
def main():
    backtest_results = get_backtest_results()
    if backtest_results is None:
        backtest_results = fallback_strategy()
    # Continue with the rest of the program

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This is a very basic implementation. The actual fallback strategy would depend on the specifics of your trading system. For example, you might want to use a default set of parameters, or you might want to stop trading altogether until the issue is resolved.
