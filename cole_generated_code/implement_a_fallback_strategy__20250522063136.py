Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This function assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that returns backtest results and `fallback_strategy()` that you want to run when no backtest results are found.

```python
def execute_strategy():
    backtest_results = run_backtest()

    if not backtest_results:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
        fallback_results = fallback_strategy()
        return fallback_results

    return backtest_results
```

This function first tries to run the backtest and get its results. If no results are found (i.e., `run_backtest()` returns `None` or an empty list), it prints a message and then runs the fallback strategy. The results of the fallback strategy are then returned. If backtest results are found, they are returned immediately.

Please replace `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` with your actual functions to run the backtest and the fallback strategy.
