Analyzing market trends and adjusting trading parameters is a complex task that involves machine learning and data analysis. Here's a simple example of how you might start to approach this problem using Python. This example uses a simple moving average strategy, which is a common strategy in stock trading.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, LSTM

# Load market data
df = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Calculate moving averages
df['MA10'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
df['MA50'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a "Buy Signal" column (When MA10 > MA50, that's a buy signal)
df['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(df['MA10'] > df['MA50'], 1, 0)

# Preprocess data for LSTM model
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0,1))
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(df['Close'].values.reshape(-1,1))

# Split data into 80% training and 20% testing
training_data_len = int(np.ceil( len(df) * .8 ))

train_data = scaled_data[0:int(training_data_len), :]
x_train = []
y_train = []

for i in range(60, len(train_data)):
    x_train.append(train_data[i-60:i, 0])
    y_train.append(train_data[i, 0])
    
x_train, y_train = np.array(x_train), np.array(y_train)

# Reshape the data
x_train = np.reshape(x_train, (x_train.shape[0], x_train.shape[1], 1))

# Build LSTM model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True,input_shape=(x_train.shape[1],1)))
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=False))
model.add(Dense(units=25))
model.add(Dense(units=1))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=1, epochs=1)

# Test the model accuracy
test_data = scaled_data[training_data_len - 60: , : ]
x_test = []
y_test = df['Close'][training_data_len : ]
for i in range(60,len(test_data)):
    x_test.append(test_data[i-60:i,0])
    
x_test = np.array(x_test)

# Reshape the data
x_test = np.reshape(x_test, (x_test.shape[0], x_test.shape[1], 1 ))

# Get the models predicted price values 
predictions = model.predict(x_test)
predictions = scaler.inverse_transform(predictions)

# Compare the predictions with the real data
valid = df[df.index >= training_data_len]
valid['Predictions'] = predictions

# Adjust trading parameters based on predictions
buy_signals = valid[valid['Buy_Signal'] == 1]
if len(buy_signals) > 0:
    print("Buy Signal Detected, Adjusting Trading Parameters")
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors. Additionally, this code assumes that you have a CSV file named 'market_data.csv' containing your market data with a 'Close' column for the closing prices. You would need to replace this with your actual data source.
