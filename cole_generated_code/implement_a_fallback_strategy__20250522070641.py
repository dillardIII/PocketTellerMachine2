Sure, here's a simple way to implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this example, I'll assume that the backtest function returns None when no results are found.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your actual backtest function
    # It should return the backtest results if they exist, and None otherwise
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your fallback strategy
    # It should be implemented to do something useful when no backtest results are found
    pass

# Use the strategy in a backtest
results = backtest('my_strategy')

# If no results are found, use the fallback strategy
if results is None:
    print("No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy.")
    results = fallback_strategy()

# Now you can continue with your code, using the results variable
# which will either contain the backtest results or the results of the fallback strategy
```

Please replace the `backtest` and `fallback_strategy` functions with your actual implementation. The `backtest` function should return the results of the backtest, and the `fallback_strategy` function should return some kind of results even when the backtest fails.
