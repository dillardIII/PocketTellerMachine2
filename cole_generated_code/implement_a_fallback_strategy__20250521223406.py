Sure, I'll provide you with a simple example of how you can implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this example, we'll assume that the `backtest()` function is used to perform a backtest and return the results. If no results are found, we'll use a fallback strategy.

```python
def backtest():
    # This function is supposed to return backtest results
    # For the sake of this example, let's assume it returns None
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function implements a fallback strategy
    # It can be anything you want, for this example, let's just print a message
    print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy...")

# Perform backtest
backtest_results = backtest()

# Check if backtest results were found
if backtest_results is None:
    # If no results were found, use fallback strategy
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    # If results were found, proceed as usual
    print("Backtest results found. Proceeding with the usual strategy...")
```

Please replace the `backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` functions with your actual functions. The `backtest()` function should return `None` or some kind of indicator when no results are found. The `fallback_strategy()` function should implement your actual fallback strategy.
