Sure, I am happy to help you. However, I need a bit more information to write accurate Python code as I need to know what sort of fallback strategy you're interested in, and what sort of data or structures you're already using.

Here is a simple and general example of a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found, but once again, it might not be what you are looking for due to lack of context.

```python
class BackTest:
    def __init__(self, strategy=None):
        self.strategy = strategy

    def perform_backtest(self):
        results = self.strategy.run() if self.strategy is not None else None

        if results is None or len(results) == 0:
            print('No backtest results found.')
            self.fallback_strategy()
        else:
            print('Backtest completed.')
            self.process_results(results)

    def fallback_strategy(self):
        print('Executing fallback strategy...')
        # Whatever your fallback strategy is, execute it here.

    def process_results(self, results):
        print('Processing results...')
        # do something with the results
```

This example assumes that "strategy" is a class with its own "run" method that returns the results of the backtesting. If strategy.run() returns a None or an empty list, it means no backtest results are found and the fallback strategy is executed.
