In order to analyze market trends and adjust trading parameters, we need historical market data. We can use libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computation, matplotlib for visualization, and sklearn for machine learning.

Here is a simple Python code to get started:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load historical market data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Assume the 'Close' column is the target variable
y = data['Close']

# Assume the 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume' columns are the features
X = data[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume']]

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict the 'Close' price
data['Predicted_Close'] = model.predict(X)

# Plot actual vs predicted 'Close' price
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
plt.plot(data['Close'])
plt.plot(data['Predicted_Close'])
plt.title('Market Trends')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend(['Actual', 'Predicted'])
plt.show()
```

This code is a basic example of how to use machine learning to predict market trends. It uses a simple linear regression model to predict the 'Close' price based on the 'Open', 'High', 'Low', and 'Volume' prices. The model is trained on the entire dataset, and the predicted 'Close' price is added as a new column in the dataframe. The actual and predicted 'Close' prices are then plotted over time.

Please note that this is a very simplistic approach and may not yield accurate results. Real-world trading algorithms use much more complex models and take into account many more factors. Also, this code does not include any form of error checking or exception handling, which should be added in a real-world scenario.
