To analyze market trends and patterns, we need historical market data. We can use libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computation, and matplotlib for visualization. We can use yfinance to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance.

Here is a simple Python script that uses Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to identify potential trading opportunities. MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def calculate_macd(data, short_window, long_window):
    short_ema = calculate_ema(data, short_window)
    long_ema = calculate_ema(data, long_window)
    macd = short_ema - long_ema
    signal = calculate_ema(macd, 9)
    return macd, signal

def download_data(stock, start, end):
    data = yf.download(stock, start, end)
    return data

def plot_macd(macd, signal, data):
    plt.figure(figsize=(12.2, 4.5))
    plt.plot(data.index, macd, label='AAPL MACD', color = 'red')
    plt.plot(data.index, signal, label='Signal Line', color='blue')
    plt.legend(loc='upper left')
    plt.show()

def analyze_trends(stock, start_date, end_date):
    # Download historical data as dataframe
    data = download_data(stock, start_date, end_date)

    # Compute MACD and Signal line indicators
    macd, signal = calculate_macd(data['Close'], 12, 26)

    # Create new columns for the data
    data['MACD'] = macd
    data['Signal Line'] = signal

    # Plot MACD
    plot_macd(macd, signal, data)

    # Create a function to signal when to buy and sell an asset
    def buy_sell(signal):
        buy = []
        sell = []
        flag = -1

        for i in range(0, len(signal)):
            if signal['MACD'][i] > signal['Signal Line'][i]:
                sell.append(np.nan)
                if flag != 1:
                    buy.append(signal['Close'][i])
                    flag = 1
                else:
                    buy.append(np.nan)
            elif signal['MACD'][i] < signal['Signal Line'][i]:
                buy.append(np.nan)
                if flag != 0:
                    sell.append(signal['Close'][i])
                    flag = 0
                else:
                    sell.append(np.nan)
            else:
                buy.append(np.nan)
                sell.append(np.nan)

        return (buy, sell)

    # Create buy and sell column
    a = buy_sell(data)
    data['Buy_Signal_Price'] = a[0]
    data['Sell_Signal_Price'] = a[1]

    return data

# Analyze trends for Apple from 2020-01-01 to 2022-12-31
df = analyze_trends('AAPL', '2020-01-01', '2022-12-31')
print(df)
```

This script calculates the MACD and the signal line indicators for the given stock and plots them. It also identifies the points where the MACD line crosses the signal line, which are potential trading opportunities. The script adds two new columns to the dataframe, 'Buy_Signal_Price' and 'Sell_Signal_Price', which indicate the price at which the stock should be bought or sold according to the MACD strategy.

Please note that this is a very basic form of algorithmic trading and doesn't take into account many factors that could
