Sure, I can help you with that. However, I need to clarify that trading in the stock market or any other financial market involves risks and there's no guaranteed way to always win. But we can increase the chances of winning by using some strategies.

Here's a simple Python code to initiate a trade using a hypothetical trading API:

```python
import requests

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, api_key, api_url):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.api_url = api_url

    def initiate_trade(self, symbol, quantity, action):
        payload = {
            'api_key': self.api_key,
            'symbol': symbol,
            'quantity': quantity,
            'action': action
        }

        response = requests.post(f'{self.api_url}/trade', json=payload)

        if response.status_code == 200:
            print(f"Trade initiated successfully: {action} {quantity} {symbol}")
        else:
            print(f"Failed to initiate trade: {response.content}")

# Initialize PTM with your API key and URL
ptm = PTM('your_api_key', 'https://api.yourtradingapi.com')

# Initiate a trade
ptm.initiate_trade('AAPL', 10, 'buy')
```

In this code, we're creating a `PTM` class that can initiate trades. We're using the `requests` library to send a POST request to the trading API. The `initiate_trade` method takes a symbol (the stock to trade), quantity (how many shares to trade), and action (whether to buy or sell).

Please replace `'your_api_key'` and `'https://api.yourtradingapi.com'` with your actual API key and the URL of your trading API. Also, the trading API URL and the parameters might be different based on your actual trading platform.

Remember, this is a very basic example and real-world trading involves more complexities like handling failures, analyzing market data, etc.
