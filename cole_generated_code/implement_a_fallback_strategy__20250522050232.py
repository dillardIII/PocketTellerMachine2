Sure, here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this example, I will assume that the backtest function returns None when no results are found.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for the actual backtest function
    # It should return the results of the backtest or None if no results are found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is the fallback strategy that will be used when no backtest results are found
    print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Process the results
        pass
```

In this code, the `execute_strategy` function attempts to execute a trading strategy by first backtesting it. If the backtest returns None (indicating that no results were found), it executes the fallback strategy.

Please replace the placeholder functions `backtest` and `fallback_strategy` with your actual implementation.
