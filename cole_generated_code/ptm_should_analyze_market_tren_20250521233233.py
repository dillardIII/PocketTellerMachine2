To analyze market trends and opportunities for potential profitable trades, you would need to use a combination of data analysis and machine learning. Here's a simple example of how you could do this using Python, pandas for data manipulation, and sklearn for machine learning.

Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading algorithms can be much more complex. Also, this example assumes that you have historical market data in a CSV file.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Load the historical market data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Assume that the CSV file has columns for 'Date' and 'Price'
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Calculate the moving average
data['Moving_Avg'] = data['Price'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the price change
data['Price_Change'] = data['Price'].pct_change()

# Drop the missing values
data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Use the moving average and price change as features
X = data[['Moving_Avg', 'Price_Change']]

# Use the price as the target
y = data['Price']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the mean absolute error of the predictions
mae = metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Mean Absolute Error: {mae}')

# If the error is small, the model's predictions are accurate
# You can use the model to predict future prices and make trades
```

This script trains a linear regression model to predict future prices based on the moving average and price change. If the mean absolute error of the model's predictions is small, you can use the model to predict future prices and make trades based on these predictions.
