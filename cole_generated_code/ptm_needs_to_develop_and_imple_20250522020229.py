Sure, I can help you write a simple Python code for a basic trading strategy. However, please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading strategies are much more complex and involve a lot more factors.

Here's a simple Python code for a moving average crossover strategy using pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas_datareader import data as web

# Define the instruments to download. We would like to see Apple in our portfolio.
tickers = ['AAPL']

# We would like all available data from 01/01/2000 until 12/31/2016.
start_date = '2000-01-01'
end_date = '2016-12-31'

# User pandas_reader.data.DataReader to load the desired data.
panel_data = web.DataReader('AAPL', 'yahoo', start_date, end_date)

# Calculate the short-term simple moving average (SMA)
short_rolling = panel_data.rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-term SMA
long_rolling = panel_data.rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create a 'signal' (invested or not invested) when the short moving average crosses the long moving average
signal = pd.DataFrame(index=panel_data.index)
signal['signal'] = 0.0
signal['short_mavg'] = short_rolling['Close']
signal['long_mavg'] = long_rolling['Close']

# Create signals
signal['signal'][short_rolling['Close'] > long_rolling['Close']] = 1.0

# Generate trading orders
signal['positions'] = signal['signal'].diff()

# Print `signal`
print(signal)
```

This code will print a dataframe where a 1 indicates a "buy" signal and a -1 indicates a "sell" signal. The buy signal comes when the short-term moving average crosses from below to above the long-term moving average, and the sell signal comes when the short-term moving average crosses from above to below the long-term moving average.

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and in real-world scenarios, you would need to consider transaction costs, risk management, portfolio optimization, and many other factors.
