Sure, here's a simple example of how you could implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume `run_backtest` is a function that runs a backtest for the given strategy
    # and returns a dictionary with the results, or None if no results were found.
    results = run_backtest(strategy)
    
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results were found. Fallback strategy will be used.")
        # Fallback strategy: return an empty dictionary
        return {}
    
    return results
```

This is a very basic fallback strategy. Depending on your needs, you might want to implement a more complex fallback strategy. For example, you could try running a different strategy, use default values, or raise an exception.
