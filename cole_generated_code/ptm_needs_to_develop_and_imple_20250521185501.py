To develop and implement trading strategies, we need to consider several factors such as historical data, technical indicators, and market trends. Here is a simple Python code using pandas and yfinance libraries to fetch historical data and calculate moving averages, which is a common technical indicator used in trading strategies.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_moving_average(data, window):
    return data['Close'].rolling(window=window).mean()

def trading_strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    # Calculate short and long moving averages
    data['Short_MA'] = calculate_moving_average(data, short_window)
    data['Long_MA'] = calculate_moving_average(data, long_window)
    
    # Create signals based on moving averages
    data['Signal'] = 0.0
    data['Signal'][short_window:] = np.where(data['Short_MA'][short_window:] > data['Long_MA'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)
    
    # Generate trading orders
    data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()
    
    return data

# Fetch historical data
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Implement trading strategy
short_window = 20
long_window = 50
data = trading_strategy(data, short_window, long_window)

# Print data
print(data)
```

This script fetches historical data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from 2020 to 2022, calculates 20-day and 50-day moving averages, generates trading signals based on these moving averages, and generates trading orders based on these signals. A buy order is generated when the short moving average crosses above the long moving average, and a sell order is generated when the short moving average crosses below the long moving average.

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and may not be profitable in real-world trading. You should consider other factors such as transaction costs, market volatility, and your risk tolerance before implementing any trading strategy. Always test your strategy with historical data and paper trading before using it with real money.
