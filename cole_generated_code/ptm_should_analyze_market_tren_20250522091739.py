In order to analyze market trends and patterns, we would need access to historical market data. This data can be obtained from various sources. For this example, I'll use the `yfinance` library to download historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.

Please note that this is a simple example and real-world trading algorithms can be very complex and involve many more factors.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = "AAPL"
tickerData = yf.Ticker(ticker)
df = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# Calculate simple moving average
df['SMA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=14).mean()

# Calculate the standard deviation
df['STD'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=14).std()

# Create a column to hold the buy/sell signals
df['Buy_Signal'] = (df['Close'] < (df['SMA'] - 2 * df['STD']))
df['Sell_Signal'] = (df['Close'] > (df['SMA'] + 2 * df['STD']))

# Print the dataframe
print(df)

# Split the data into training and testing data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['Close'].values.reshape(-1,1), df['SMA'].values.reshape(-1,1), test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Create a linear regression model and fit it using the training data
model = LinearRegression()  
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the model to predict the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Compare the actual output values for X_test with the predicted values
df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test.flatten(), 'Predicted': y_pred.flatten()})
print(df)
```

This code calculates the simple moving average and standard deviation for a given stock (in this case, Apple Inc.). It then generates buy signals when the closing price is two standard deviations below the moving average and sell signals when it's two standard deviations above. 

It also uses a simple linear regression model to predict future values based on the closing price. The actual and predicted values are then printed out for comparison. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and should not be used for actual trading decisions. A real trading algorithm would take into account many more factors and would likely use much more sophisticated statistical techniques.
