Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that the backtest results are stored in a list and the fallback strategy is to return a message notifying the user that no backtest results were found.

```python
def get_backtest_results(backtest_results):
    if len(backtest_results) == 0:
        return "No backtest results found. Please run the backtest again."
    else:
        return backtest_results

# Example usage:
backtest_results = [] # This should be replaced with the actual backtest results
print(get_backtest_results(backtest_results))
```

In this code, the `get_backtest_results` function checks if the `backtest_results` list is empty. If it is, it returns a message saying "No backtest results found. Please run the backtest again." If the list is not empty, it simply returns the list of backtest results.

Please replace `backtest_results` with your actual data. If your data structure is different, you may need to modify the code to fit your needs.
