You've asked for a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found in Python. Here is a basic example assuming that we run a function for backtest and it returns either results or None if there are no results.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Insert your backtesting logic here
    # If there are results, return them. Otherwise, return None.
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # Define your fallback strategy here
    print("Running fallback strategy...")
    pass

def execute_backtest():
    print("Running backtest...")
    results = run_backtest()
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")
        # proceed with your next steps
        pass
execute_backtest()
```

Please modify the `run_backtest` and `fallback_strategy` functions based on your own business logic. The `run_backtest` function should include your backtesting process and return results or None if not found. When `execute_backtest` is run, if no results are found from the backtest, the fallback strategy is initiated. If results are found, you can proceed with your next steps. 

This is a simplistic approach. Actual implementation may need to include additional error checking and handling based on your specific requirements.
