To analyze market trends and patterns, we can use various libraries in Python like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn. Here is a simple example of how you can analyze market trends using moving averages:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# Fetching data
def fetch_data(stock_name):
    df = pdr.get_data_yahoo(stock_name, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")
    return df

# Calculating moving averages
def calculate_moving_averages(df, short_window, long_window):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Short moving average
    signals['short_mavg'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Long moving average
    signals['long_mavg'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                                > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Plotting data
def plot_data(df, signals):
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111, ylabel='Price in $')
    df['Close'].plot(ax=ax1, color='r', lw=2.)
    signals[['short_mavg', 'long_mavg']].plot(ax=ax1, lw=2.)

    # Plot the buy signals
    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == 1.0].index, 
             signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == 1.0],
             '^', markersize=10, color='m')
    
    # Plot the sell signals
    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == -1.0].index, 
             signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == -1.0],
             'v', markersize=10, color='k')
    
    plt.show()

# Main function
def main():
    stock_name = 'AAPL'
    df = fetch_data(stock_name)
    short_window = 40
    long_window = 100
    signals = calculate_moving_averages(df, short_window, long_window)
    plot_data(df, signals)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script fetches the historical data of a stock (in this case, Apple), calculates the short-term and long-term moving averages, and generates trading signals based on these moving averages. It then plots the stock price, moving averages, and trading signals. 

Please note that this is a very basic form of trend analysis and in real-world scenarios, you would need to consider many other factors and use more sophisticated algorithms for accurate predictions.
