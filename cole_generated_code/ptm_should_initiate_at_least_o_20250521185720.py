Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. Please note that this is a mock-up code and does not actually perform any real trading. For real trading, you would need to use a trading API and follow all legal and ethical guidelines.

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, stock, price, quantity):
        self.stock = stock
        self.price = price
        self.quantity = quantity

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []

    def initiate_trade(self, stock, price, quantity):
        new_trade = Trade(stock, price, quantity)
        self.trades.append(new_trade)
        print(f"Trade initiated: Bought {quantity} of {stock} at {price}")
        return new_trade

# Create PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
ptm.initiate_trade('AAPL', 150.0, 10)
```

In this code, we have two classes: `Trade` and `PTM`. The `Trade` class represents a trade with attributes like stock, price, and quantity. The `PTM` class represents the trading system with a list of trades and a method to initiate a trade.

The `initiate_trade` method creates a new `Trade` instance and adds it to the list of trades. It also prints a message to indicate that a trade has been initiated.

Finally, we create an instance of `PTM` and initiate a trade. This is just a simulation and does not represent actual trading.
