Here is a simple Python code that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    backtest_results = {}  # Assume this is where you fetch your backtest results

    if not backtest_results:  # If no backtest results are found
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        return {}

    return backtest_results

# Test the function
print(get_backtest_results())
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results` is a function that is supposed to fetch backtest results. If no results are found (i.e., if `backtest_results` is empty), it prints a message and returns an empty dictionary as a fallback.

Please replace the backtest_results with the actual method you use to fetch the backtest results. The fallback strategy can be customized based on your requirements. For example, you might want to fetch results from a different source, use some default results, or perform some other action.
