Sure, I can help you write a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. Please note that this is a very basic example and does not include real trading strategies or risk management.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # initial balance
        self.trades = 0  # number of trades

    def trade(self):
        # Randomly decide whether the trade is a win or loss
        win = random.choice([True, False])

        if win:
            # If win, increase balance by 10%
            self.balance *= 1.1
            print("Trade won! New balance is: ", self.balance)
        else:
            # If loss, decrease balance by 10%
            self.balance *= 0.9
            print("Trade lost. New balance is: ", self.balance)

        # Increase the number of trades
        self.trades += 1

# Create a PTM
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
ptm.trade()
```

This code creates a PTM (pseudo trading machine) with an initial balance of 10000. The `trade` method simulates a trade by randomly deciding whether the trade is a win or a loss. If the trade is a win, the balance increases by 10%. If the trade is a loss, the balance decreases by 10%. After each trade, the number of trades increases by 1.

Please note that trading in the real world is much more complex and involves a lot more factors. This is a very simplified example and should not be used for real trading.
