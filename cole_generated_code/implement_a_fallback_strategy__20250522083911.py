Sure, I can help with that. However, I need more details about what the fallback strategy should do when no backtest results are found. For example, should it return a default value, raise an exception, or perform a different action? 

For now, I'll assume that we want to return a default value. Here's a simple example:

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # Assume this function returns backtest results
    # If no results are found, it returns None
    # This is just a placeholder. In a real scenario, you would have your backtesting logic here.
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is the fallback strategy
    # It could be anything: returning a default value, raising an exception, etc.
    return "No backtest results found. Applying fallback strategy."

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        return fallback_strategy()
    else:
        return results
```

In this example, `execute_strategy` first tries to get the backtest results. If no results are found (i.e., `backtest` returns `None`), it applies the fallback strategy.

Please provide more details if you want a different behavior.
