Sure, here's a simple example of how you might use Python to analyze market trends and opportunities. In this example, we'll use the pandas library to analyze historical stock data, and the yfinance library to fetch the data from Yahoo Finance.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-1-25')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Calculate moving averages
tickerDf['MA10'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(10).mean()
tickerDf['MA50'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(50).mean()

# Create a function to signal when to buy or sell the stock
def buy_sell(signal):
    Buy = []
    Sell = []
    flag = -1

    for i in range(0, len(signal)):
        if signal['MA10'][i] > signal['MA50'][i]:
            Sell.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 1:
                Buy.append(signal['Close'][i])
                flag = 1
            else:
                Buy.append(np.nan)
        elif signal['MA10'][i] < signal['MA50'][i]:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 0:
                Sell.append(signal['Close'][i])
                flag = 0
            else:
                Sell.append(np.nan)
        else:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            Sell.append(np.nan)

    return (Buy, Sell)

# Create buy and sell column
tickerDf['Buy_Signal_Price'] = buy_sell(tickerDf)[0]
tickerDf['Sell_Signal_Price'] = buy_sell(tickerDf)[1]

# Print the dataframe
print(tickerDf)
```

This script fetches historical data for Apple's stock, calculates 10-day and 50-day moving averages, and generates buy/sell signals based on these averages. When the 10-day moving average crosses above the 50-day moving average, it's a potential buy signal, and when it crosses below, it's a potential sell signal. Please note that this is a very simple strategy and should not be used for real trading without further enhancements.
