To initiate a trade, we would need to use an API provided by the trading platform. Here, I'll assume we're using Alpaca API, a popular trading API for Python. 

First, you need to install the Alpaca API by running the following command in your terminal:

```python
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Then, you can use the following Python code to initiate a trade:

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set your API keys
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

Remember to replace `<APCA-API-KEY-ID>` and `<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>` with your actual API keys. 

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock at the current market price. The trade is a 'good till cancelled' order, which means it will stay active until it is filled or cancelled.

Please note that this is a paper trading API endpoint, which means it's for simulated trading and won't actually buy any real stocks. If you want to do actual trading, you need to use the live trading endpoint provided by Alpaca and ensure you have sufficient permissions and funds.

Also, keep in mind that trading involves risk, and you should only trade with money that you can afford to lose.
