Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trading action. Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading involves complex algorithms and strategies.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # initial balance
        self.stocks = 0  # initial stocks

    def trade(self):
        # Randomly decide to buy or sell
        action = random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])

        if action == 'buy':
            # Randomly decide the amount to buy (1 to 10)
            amount = random.randint(1, 10)
            self.buy(amount)
        else:
            # Randomly decide the amount to sell (1 to 10)
            amount = random.randint(1, 10)
            self.sell(amount)

    def buy(self, amount):
        # Assume each stock costs $100
        cost = amount * 100

        # Only buy if we have enough balance
        if cost <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= cost
            self.stocks += amount
            print(f'Bought {amount} stocks for ${cost}. Balance: ${self.balance}')

    def sell(self, amount):
        # Only sell if we have enough stocks
        if amount <= self.stocks:
            self.stocks -= amount
            # Assume each stock sells for $100
            revenue = amount * 100
            self.balance += revenue
            print(f'Sold {amount} stocks for ${revenue}. Balance: ${self.balance}')

# Create a PTM and initiate a trade
ptm = PTM()
ptm.trade()
```

This script creates a PTM (Portfolio Trading Model) with an initial balance of $10,000 and no stocks. The `trade` method randomly decides to buy or sell stocks. The `buy` and `sell` methods handle the buying and selling of stocks, respectively. Each stock is assumed to cost $100. The PTM only buys stocks if it has enough balance, and only sells stocks if it has enough stocks. After each trade, the balance is updated and printed.
