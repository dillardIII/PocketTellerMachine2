Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found.

```python
class TradingAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.backtest_results = None

    def perform_backtest(self):
        # Code to perform backtest goes here
        # This is a placeholder for the actual backtest code
        # The backtest results should be stored in self.backtest_results

        pass

    def fallback_strategy(self):
        # Code for fallback strategy goes here
        # This is a placeholder for the actual fallback strategy code

        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy...")

    def execute_strategy(self):
        if self.backtest_results is None:
            self.fallback_strategy()
        else:
            # Code to execute main strategy goes here
            # This is a placeholder for the actual strategy code

            print("Executing main strategy...")

# Usage
assistant = TradingAssistant()
assistant.perform_backtest()
assistant.execute_strategy()
```

In this code, `TradingAssistant` is a class that represents your trading assistant. It has a method `perform_backtest` to perform the backtest and store the results in `self.backtest_results`. If `self.backtest_results` is `None` (which means no backtest results were found), the `execute_strategy` method will call the `fallback_strategy` method. Otherwise, it will execute the main strategy.
