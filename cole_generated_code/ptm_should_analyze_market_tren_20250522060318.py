To analyze market trends and adjust trading strategies, we would need to use some form of machine learning or data analysis. Here's a basic example of how you might approach this using Python and a library called pandas for data analysis. This is a very simplified version and in a real-world scenario, you would need a much more complex algorithm, possibly involving machine learning.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load market data into a pandas DataFrame
# This data might be downloaded from a financial API, for example
market_data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# We'll use 'Volume' and 'Close' as features to predict the 'Adj Close' price
features = market_data[['Volume', 'Close']]
target = market_data['Adj Close']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
features_train, features_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2)

# Create and train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(features_train, target_train)

# Now we can use this model to predict the 'Adj Close' price from 'Volume' and 'Close'
predictions = model.predict(features_test)

# We might adjust our trading strategy based on these predictions
# For example, if the predicted 'Adj Close' price is higher than the current 'Close' price, we might decide to buy
for i in range(len(predictions)):
    if predictions[i] > features_test.iloc[i]['Close']:
        print("Buy")
    else:
        print("Sell")
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example and doesn't take into account many factors that would be important in a real-world trading scenario. For example, it doesn't consider transaction costs, it assumes that you can buy and sell at the closing price, and it doesn't have any way to handle errors in the predictions. It's also using a very simple linear regression model, which is unlikely to be the best choice for this kind of task. A more sophisticated model might use a different kind of machine learning algorithm, and might take into account more features and more complex relationships between them.
