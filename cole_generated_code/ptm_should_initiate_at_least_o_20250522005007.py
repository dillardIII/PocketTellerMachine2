Here is a simple example of how you could implement a trading bot in Python. This bot will use a very basic trading strategy of buying when the price is low and selling when the price is high. 

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real trading bots use complex algorithms and have many more features. Also, this bot will not actually execute any trades as it is just a simulation.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # initial balance
        self.shares = 0  # initial shares
        self.price = 100  # initial price

    def trade(self):
        # simulate price fluctuation
        self.price += random.randint(-10, 10)

        if self.price < 90 and self.balance > self.price:
            # price is low, buy shares
            shares_to_buy = self.balance // self.price
            self.balance -= shares_to_buy * self.price
            self.shares += shares_to_buy
            print(f"Bought {shares_to_buy} shares at {self.price}")

        elif self.price > 110 and self.shares > 0:
            # price is high, sell shares
            self.balance += self.shares * self.price
            print(f"Sold {self.shares} shares at {self.price}")
            self.shares = 0

        print(f"Balance: {self.balance}, Shares: {self.shares}, Price: {self.price}")

# create a PTM and initiate a trade
ptm = PTM()
for _ in range(100):  # simulate 100 days of trading
    ptm.trade()
```

This bot will simulate 100 days of trading, buying shares when the price drops below 90 and selling when the price rises above 110. The price fluctuates randomly between -10 and 10 each day. The bot's balance and the number of shares it owns are printed after each trade.
