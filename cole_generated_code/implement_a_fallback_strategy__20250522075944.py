Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this example, I'm assuming that the backtest function returns None when no results are found and that the fallback strategy is to simply print a message and return an empty dictionary. 

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assuming backtest is a function that takes a strategy and returns the backtest results
    results = backtest(strategy)

    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Fallback strategy: return an empty dictionary
        return {}
    else:
        return results
```

This is a very basic fallback strategy. Depending on your specific needs, you might want to implement a more complex fallback strategy. For example, you could try backtesting a default strategy, or you could try backtesting the original strategy with different parameters.
