Sure, here is a simple Python code that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found.

```python
class Backtest:
    def __init__(self):
        self.results = None

    def run_backtest(self):
        # Run the backtest here
        # If the backtest is successful, assign the results to self.results
        pass

    def get_results(self):
        if self.results is None:
            return self.fallback_strategy()
        else:
            return self.results

    def fallback_strategy(self):
        # Implement your fallback strategy here
        # For example, return a default result
        return "No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy."


# Example usage:
backtest = Backtest()
backtest.run_backtest()
print(backtest.get_results())
```

In this example, the `Backtest` class has a `run_backtest` method that is supposed to run a backtest and assign the results to `self.results`. If `self.results` is `None` when `get_results` is called, it means that no backtest results were found, and the `fallback_strategy` method is called. The `fallback_strategy` method should implement the actual fallback strategy. In this example, it simply returns a string saying that no backtest results were found and the fallback strategy is being run.
