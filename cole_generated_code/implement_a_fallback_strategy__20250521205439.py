Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs your backtest and returns the results, or `None` if no results are found.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    print("Running fallback strategy...")
    # Your fallback strategy code here
    pass

# Run the backtest
backtest_results = run_backtest()

# If no backtest results are found, run the fallback strategy
if backtest_results is None:
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    print("Backtest results found.")
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` is a placeholder for your actual backtest function, and `fallback_strategy()` is a placeholder for your fallback strategy. If `run_backtest()` returns `None`, indicating that no backtest results were found, the fallback strategy is executed. Otherwise, the program prints a message indicating that backtest results were found. 

You would need to replace `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` with your actual backtest and fallback strategy functions.
