Here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that you have a function named `run_backtest()` that runs the backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, the fallback strategy is to return a message notifying the user.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    results = run_backtest()
    
    if not results:
        return "No backtest results found. Please try again later or check your parameters."
    
    return results
```

This is a very basic fallback strategy. Depending on your specific needs, you might want to implement more complex strategies, such as retrying the backtest after a certain period of time, running a different backtest, or notifying the user via email or other means.
