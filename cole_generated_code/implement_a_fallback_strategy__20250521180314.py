To give a good solution, I'll make some assumptions:
- Coles uses a function `run_backtest()` which returns backtest results or `None` in case no backtest results are found. 
- As a fallback strategy, there will be an attempt to run a basic, default backtest which won't be complex as your normal backtest.

Here's a basic example of how you can code a fallback strategy in Python:

```python
def run_backtest():
    # your complex backtest logic here
    # if backtest is successful:
    # return backtest results
    # else return None
    
    return None

def run_basic_backtest():
    # your basic backtest logic here
    # return backtest results
    
    return "basic backtest results"

def execute_backtest():
    # attempt to run the normal backtest
    results = run_backtest()
    
    # check if results are not None
    if results is not None:
        print("Backtest successful. Results: ", results)
        return results
    else:
        # fallback to basic backtest
        print("Normal backtest failed. Running basic backtest.")
        default_results = run_basic_backtest()
        print("Basic backtest successful. Results: ", default_results)
        return default_results

execute_backtest()
```

So, if the `run_backtest()` function returns `None`, indicating that the backtest were not successful, we then fallback to running a basic backtest `run_basic_backtest()`. Of course, this is just a basic example. You'd need to adapt this to your specific use case to fit in your trading environment.
