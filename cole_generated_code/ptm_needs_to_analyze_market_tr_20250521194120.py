To analyze market trends and identify potential profitable trades, we could use the pandas library to manipulate data and matplotlib to visualize it. We could also use yfinance to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance. Here's a simple example of how you might do this for a single stock. This example calculates the simple moving average (SMA) of the closing prices and identifies potential buy/sell opportunities when the price crosses the SMA.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate the SMA
window = 20
data['SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window).mean()

# Identify potential buy/sell opportunities
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['Close'] > data['SMA'])
data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['Close'] < data['SMA'])

# Plot the closing prices and SMA
plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close')
plt.plot(data['SMA'], label='SMA', color='orange')
plt.scatter(data.index, data['Close'][data['Buy_Signal']], color='green', marker='^', alpha=1)
plt.scatter(data.index, data['Close'][data['Sell_Signal']], color='red', marker='v', alpha=1)
plt.title('Apple Close Prices & Simple Moving Average')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```

This is a very simple strategy and should not be used for actual trading without further refinement. For example, it does not take into account transaction costs or the fact that the price may fluctuate within a single day. It also does not consider other potentially relevant factors, such as the company's fundamentals or broader market trends. 

For a more sophisticated analysis, you might want to use machine learning techniques to predict future prices based on historical data. However, this is a complex task that requires a good understanding of both finance and machine learning.
