Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic trading strategy. This strategy will be based on the Moving Average Crossover, which is a popular strategy in algorithmic trading.

Please note that this is a very simple strategy and may not necessarily lead to profits. It's just an example to show how one might code a trading strategy in Python. Also, this code assumes that you have historical trading data in a pandas DataFrame called 'df'.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assuming df is your DataFrame and it has a 'Close' column that represents the closing prices

# Calculate the short-term simple moving average
short_sma = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-term simple moving average
long_sma = df['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create a column in the DataFrame to hold the trading signals
df['signal'] = 0.0

# Generate trading signals based on the crossover of the short-term and long-term moving averages
df['signal'][short_sma > long_sma] = 1.0
df['signal'][short_sma < long_sma] = -1.0

# Calculate the daily returns of the trading strategy
df['strategy_returns'] = df['signal'].shift() * df['Close'].pct_change()

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```

This code will generate trading signals based on the crossover of the short-term and long-term moving averages. When the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, it generates a buy signal (1.0). When the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, it generates a sell signal (-1.0).

The daily returns of the trading strategy are then calculated by multiplying the trading signals by the daily percentage change in the closing prices.

Please note that this code doesn't include transaction costs and it assumes that you can trade at the closing price of each day, which may not be possible in reality. Also, this is a very simple strategy and may not necessarily lead to profits. It's just an example to show how one might code a trading strategy in Python.
