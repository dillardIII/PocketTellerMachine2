To complete this task, we would need to use a Python library like pandas for data analysis, and another library like yfinance to fetch the market data. We would also need to implement some form of algorithm to analyze the trends and make trading decisions. Here is a basic example of how this could be done:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Fetch market data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Define a signal
data['Signal'] = 0.0  
data['Signal'][50:] = np.where(data['SMA_50'][50:] > data['SMA_200'][50:], 1.0, 0.0)   

# Generate trading orders
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Print data
print(data)

# Implement trading strategy
for i in range(len(data)):
    if data['Position'][i] == 1.0:
        print("Buy")
    elif data['Position'][i] == -1.0:
        print("Sell")
```

This is a very basic example of a trading bot that uses a simple moving average crossover strategy. It fetches historical market data for Apple's stock (AAPL), calculates 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and generates a "buy" signal whenever the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average, and a "sell" signal when it crosses below.

Please note that this is a very simplistic strategy and should not be used for real trading without further improvements and risk management. Also, this code does not actually execute any trades, it just prints out the trading signals. To execute trades, you would need to integrate with a trading platform's API.
