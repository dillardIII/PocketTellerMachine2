Here is a simple Python code to implement risk management measures. This code calculates the risk of a trade and only allows the trade to proceed if the risk is within a certain limit.

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, buy_price, sell_price, units):
        self.buy_price = buy_price
        self.sell_price = sell_price
        self.units = units

    def calculate_risk(self):
        return (self.buy_price - self.sell_price) * self.units

class RiskManagement:
    def __init__(self, max_risk):
        self.max_risk = max_risk

    def is_trade_allowed(self, trade):
        return trade.calculate_risk() <= self.max_risk

# Example usage:
trade = Trade(100, 90, 10)
risk_management = RiskManagement(200)

if risk_management.is_trade_allowed(trade):
    print("Trade is allowed")
else:
    print("Trade is not allowed due to high risk")
```

In this code, we define a `Trade` class with a `calculate_risk` method. The risk of a trade is calculated as the difference between the buy price and the sell price, multiplied by the number of units.

We also define a `RiskManagement` class with a `is_trade_allowed` method. This method checks if the risk of a trade is within the maximum allowed risk.

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In a real-world application, risk management would be much more complex and would consider many other factors.
