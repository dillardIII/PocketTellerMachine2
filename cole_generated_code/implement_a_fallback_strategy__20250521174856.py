Sure, I can provide an example of how you can implement a fallback strategy in Python.

```python
class BackTest:
    def __init__(self, strategy):
        self.strategy = strategy
        self.results = self.run_backtest()

    def run_backtest(self):
        # implement your backtest logic here
        ...
        return results

    def get_results(self):
        if self.results is not None:
            return self.results
        else:
            return self.fallback_strategy()

    def fallback_strategy(self):
        # implement your fallback strategy here
        print("No backtest results found. Running the fallback strategy...")
        fallback_results = ...
        return fallback_results
```

In this example, we have a class "BackTest" that uses a trading strategy to run a backtest when it's initialized. The results of the backtest are saved in self.results. 

The method get_results returns the results of the backtest, if they are not None. Otherwise, it calls the method fallback_strategy which represents the implementation of the fallback strategy (a function that defines what to do when no backtest results are found).

This code is just an example and should be adapted according to the context and your needs (like actual backtest logic and fallback strategy implementation). Please replace `...` with your own code.
