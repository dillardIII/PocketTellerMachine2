Sure, I can provide you with a basic example of how a trade could be initiated using Python. However, please note that this is a simplified example and actual trading systems are much more complex and require proper handling of data, error checking, and security measures.

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, ticker, volume):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.volume = volume

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, strategy):
        self.strategy = strategy

    def initiate_trade(self):
        # Here we're just randomly deciding whether to buy or sell for simplicity
        action = random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])

        # Let's say our strategy is to trade in 100 volume increments
        volume = self.strategy * 100

        # For this example, let's say we're trading AAPL
        trade = Trade('AAPL', volume)

        print(f"Initiated a {action} trade for {trade.volume} shares of {trade.ticker}")

# Initialize PTM with a strategy of 1
ptm = PTM(1)

# PTM initiates a trade
ptm.initiate_trade()
```

This script will print out a message indicating a trade has been initiated. In a real-world scenario, you would likely want to connect to a trading API to actually execute the trade.
