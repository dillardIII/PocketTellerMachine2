Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, the fallback is simply to print a message and return an empty dictionary, but you could replace this with any action you want.

```python
def run_backtest(strategy):
    # Run the backtest for the given strategy
    # This is just a placeholder. Replace with your actual backtest code.
    results = {}  # Assume we get results as a dictionary

    # Check if results are empty
    if not results:
        # Fallback strategy
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
        return fallback_strategy()
    else:
        return results

def fallback_strategy():
    # Implement your fallback strategy here
    # For now, we'll just return an empty dictionary
    print("Fallback strategy executed.")
    return {}
```

In this code, `run_backtest` is a function that runs a backtest for a given strategy. If the backtest results are empty (i.e., no results are found), it calls the `fallback_strategy` function. The `fallback_strategy` function is where you would implement your fallback strategy. In this case, it simply prints a message and returns an empty dictionary.
