Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement this in Python. I'll assume that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs the backtest and returns the results if they exist, and `None` otherwise. 

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your fallback strategy code here
    pass

# Run the backtest
backtest_results = run_backtest()

# If no backtest results are found, run the fallback strategy
if backtest_results is None:
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
    fallback_results = fallback_strategy()
    print("Fallback strategy results:", fallback_results)
else:
    print("Backtest results:", backtest_results)
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` are placeholders for your actual backtest and fallback strategy implementations. If `run_backtest()` returns `None`, indicating that no backtest results were found, the code prints a message and then runs and prints the results of the fallback strategy. Otherwise, it prints the backtest results.
