Sure, here is a simple Python code that uses the Alpaca API to initiate a trade. This code will buy 1 share of Apple stock. Please replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your actual API keys.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Setup
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Check if the market is open
clock = api.get_clock()
if clock.is_open:
    # Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (ticker symbol "AAPL")
    api.submit_order(
        symbol='AAPL',
        qty=1,
        side='buy',
        type='market',
        time_in_force='gtc'
    )
else:
    print("The market is currently closed.")
```

This code first checks if the market is open. If it is, it submits a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock. If the market is closed, it prints a message saying so.

Please note that this code uses the Alpaca API's paper trading URL, which means it's using simulated money for testing and learning purposes. To use real money, you would need to change the `base_url` to `'https://api.alpaca.markets'`.

Also, remember that trading involves risk, and this code does not contain any logic for deciding when to buy or sell stocks. It's important to understand the risks and have a strategy before trading with real money.
