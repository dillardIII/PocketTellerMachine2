As an AI, I can provide a basic Python code to analyze stock market data. However, it's important to note that real-world trading analysis involves complex algorithms and risk management strategies. Here's a simple example using pandas library and Yahoo Finance data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as web
import datetime

# Define the instruments to download. We would like to see Apple, Microsoft and the S&P500 index.
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', '^GSPC']

# Define which online source to use
data_source = 'yahoo'

# Define the start and end dates that we want to see
start_date = '2010-01-01'
end_date = '2020-12-31'

# Use pandas_reader.data.DataReader to load the desired data. As simple as that.
panel_data = web.DataReader(tickers, data_source, start_date, end_date)

# Getting just the adjusted closing prices. This will return a Pandas DataFrame
# The index in this DataFrame is the major index of the panel_data.
close = panel_data['Adj Close']

# Getting all weekdays between start_date and end_date
all_weekdays = pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date, freq='B')

# How do we align the existing prices in adj_close with our new set of dates?
# All we need to do is reindex close using all_weekdays as the new index
close = close.reindex(all_weekdays)

# Reindexing will insert missing values (NaN) for the dates that were not present
# in the original set. We can fill the missing values by replacing them with the latest 
# available price for each instrument.
close = close.fillna(method='ffill')

print(close.head(10))
```

This code will print the adjusted closing prices of Apple, Microsoft and the S&P500 index for the first 10 business days of 2010.

This is a very basic form of analysis. For more sophisticated analysis, you might want to consider using machine learning models or other advanced techniques.
