Sure, here is a simple example of a Python code that uses the Alpaca API to initiate a trade. Alpaca is a platform that allows users to build and trade with real-time market data for free. Please replace `'APCA-API-KEY-ID'` and `'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY'` with your actual Alpaca API key ID and secret key.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Initiate a trade
def initiate_trade():
    symbol = 'AAPL'  # The stock to trade
    qty = 1  # The number of shares to buy
    side = 'buy'  # The type of trade: 'buy' or 'sell'
    type = 'market'  # The type of order: 'market', 'limit', 'stop', 'stop_limit' or 'trailing_stop'
    time_in_force = 'gtc'  # The duration the order should be active: 'day', 'gtc', 'opg' or 'cls'

    try:
        api.submit_order(
            symbol=symbol,
            qty=qty,
            side=side,
            type=type,
            time_in_force=time_in_force
        )
        print(f"Successfully initiated {side} order for {qty} shares of {symbol}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while trying to initiate a trade: {e}")

# Call the function to initiate a trade
initiate_trade()
```

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple Inc. (AAPL) at the market price. The order will remain active until it is filled (good-til-cancelled).

Please note that this is a very basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would likely want to incorporate more complex trading strategies, risk management, and error handling.
