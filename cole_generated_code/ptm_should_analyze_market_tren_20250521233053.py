To analyze market trends and patterns, we can use Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for data visualization, and sklearn for machine learning. Here's a simple example of how you might start to approach this problem:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data (replace with your actual data source)
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# We'll use 'Open' and 'Close' prices to calculate the 'Change' in price
data['Change'] = data['Close'] - data['Open']

# Next, we'll shift the 'Change' column up to get the previous day's change
data['PrevChange'] = data['Change'].shift(-1)

# Drop missing values
data = data.dropna()

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data['Change'].values.reshape(-1,1), data['PrevChange'].values, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing set
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Plot the results
plt.scatter(y_test, predictions)
plt.xlabel('True Values')
plt.ylabel('Predictions')
plt.show()
```

This is a very simple example and might not give you the best results. For a more sophisticated analysis, you could use more advanced machine learning models, use more features (like volume, high, low, etc.), or use technical indicators (like moving averages, RSI, etc.). 

Also, please note that predicting stock prices is a very complex task and even the most advanced models might not give you accurate predictions. Always use such models with caution.
