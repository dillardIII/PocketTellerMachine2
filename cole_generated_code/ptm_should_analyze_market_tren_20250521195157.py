To analyze market trends and adjust trading approach accordingly, we would need to use Machine Learning and Data Analysis. Here is a basic example of how you might use Python to analyze market trends. However, this is a complex task that would usually require a much more sophisticated approach.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load market data into a pandas DataFrame
# This data should include features that may indicate market trends
# For example, it might include the closing prices of different stocks over time
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Define target variable (what we want to predict)
# In this case, let's say we want to predict the closing price of a specific stock
target = 'closing_price'

# Split data into features (X) and target (y)
X = data.drop(target, axis=1)
y = data[target]

# Split data into training set and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Now the model can predict the closing price of the stock based on the provided features
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# We can adjust our trading approach based on these predictions
# For example, if the predicted closing price is higher than the current price, we might want to buy the stock
```

Please note that this is a very basic example. In reality, predicting market trends is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of the market and sophisticated machine learning models. Also, the model needs to be tested and validated to ensure its predictions are reliable.
