To analyze market trends and adjust trading parameters, you will need to use some sort of machine learning or data analysis library. Here is a simple example of how you might do this using the pandas library for data analysis and the sklearn library for machine learning.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load market data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Analyze trends
X = data[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume']]
y = data['Close']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the model to predict the closing prices
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Adjust trading parameters based on the model's predictions
# For example, if the predicted closing price is higher than the current price, buy more stocks
for i in range(len(predictions)):
    if predictions[i] > X_test.iloc[i]['Close']:
        print(f"Buy more stocks at {X_test.iloc[i]['Close']}")
    else:
        print(f"Sell stocks at {X_test.iloc[i]['Close']}")
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex. They take into account many more factors and use more advanced machine learning models. Also, this code assumes that you have a CSV file named 'market_data.csv' which contains your market data. The columns 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume' and 'Close' represent the opening price, highest price, lowest price, volume of trades and closing price of the stocks respectively.

This code also doesn't actually execute any trades, it just prints out what action you should take based on the model's predictions. To actually execute trades, you would need to integrate with a trading API.
