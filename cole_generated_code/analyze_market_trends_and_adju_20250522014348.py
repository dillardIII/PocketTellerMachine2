Analyzing market trends and adjusting trading strategies is a complex task that involves a lot of data analysis and machine learning. Here is a simple example of how you might start to approach this problem using Python. This code uses the pandas library to analyze stock data and the sklearn library to create a simple predictive model.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Load the stock data
df = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv')

# Calculate moving averages to identify trends
df['SMA_5'] = df['price'].rolling(window=5).mean()
df['SMA_10'] = df['price'].rolling(window=10).mean()

# Create a column to hold the predicted future price
df['future_price'] = df['price'].shift(-1)

# Drop rows with missing values
df = df.dropna()

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X = df[['SMA_5', 'SMA_10']]
y = df['future_price']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the model to predict future prices
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy of the model
print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))
print('Mean Squared Error:', metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
print('Root Mean Squared Error:', np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)))

# If the predicted future price is higher than the current price, buy the stock
df['buy'] = df['future_price'] > df['price']

print(df)
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world stock market prediction is a much more complex problem that involves analyzing a lot more factors. Also, this code assumes that you have a CSV file named 'stock_data.csv' that contains your stock data.
