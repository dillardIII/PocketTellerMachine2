Sure, please first check your system to see if backtest results are available. When no backtest results are found, you will see a fallback message or action. The code you need depends on how your system is set up, but a very simple case might look like this:

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    # This function should return the results of a backtest
    # For simplicity, let's assume it returns None if no results were found
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # Execute your fallback strategy here
    print("No backtest results were found. Executing fallback strategy...")

backtest_results = get_backtest_results()

if backtest_results is None:
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    print("Backtest results found:", backtest_results)
```

In the above code:

1. We have a function `get_backtest_results()` that attempts to get backtest results. I've assumed that it returns `None` when no results were found just for simplicity, but in practice, of course, the implementation of this function would be much more complex.

2. We have a function `fallback_strategy()` that is called when no backtest results are found. Right now it just prints a message, but you would replace this with whatever you want to do just in case: re-run the backtest with different parameters, log an error message, or send a notification, among others.

3. Finally, we call `get_backtest_results()` and check if the result is `None`. If it is, we call the `fallback_strategy()` function; otherwise, we print the results.
