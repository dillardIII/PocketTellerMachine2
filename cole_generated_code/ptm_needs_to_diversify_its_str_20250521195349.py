To diversify strategies and test them in the market, we need to create a backtesting environment. Here is a simple example of how you can do it using Python and the pandas library.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime

# Let's assume we have some market data in a CSV file
market_data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Convert the 'Date' column to datetime
market_data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(market_data['Date'])

# Set 'Date' as the index
market_data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Define some strategies
def strategy1(data):
    # Buy when the price is low and sell when the price is high
    return (data['Low'] + data['High']) / 2

def strategy2(data):
    # Buy when the price is high and sell when the price is low
    return (data['High'] + data['Low']) / 2

# Test the strategies
def backtest(data, strategy):
    # Calculate the strategy
    data['Strategy'] = strategy(data)
    
    # Calculate the returns
    data['Return'] = data['Strategy'].pct_change()
    
    # Calculate the cumulative returns
    data['Cumulative Return'] = (1 + data['Return']).cumprod()
    
    return data

# Test the strategies
backtest_data1 = backtest(market_data, strategy1)
backtest_data2 = backtest(market_data, strategy2)

# Print the results
print(backtest_data1)
print(backtest_data2)
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider transaction costs, slippage, and other factors. You would also need to use more sophisticated strategies and possibly machine learning algorithms.
