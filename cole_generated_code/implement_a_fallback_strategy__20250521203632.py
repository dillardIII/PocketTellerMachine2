Sure, here's a simple way to implement a fallback strategy in Python:

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    try:
        # Try to run the backtest
        results = strategy.run_backtest()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Backtest failed: {str(e)}")
        results = None

    # If no results are found, implement fallback strategy
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        fallback_strategy = FallbackStrategy()
        try:
            results = fallback_strategy.run_backtest()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Fallback strategy failed: {str(e)}")
            results = None

    return results
```

In this code, we first try to run the backtest with the given strategy. If it fails or returns no results, we then try to run the backtest with a fallback strategy. If the fallback strategy also fails, we return None.

Please note that this code assumes the existence of a `run_backtest` method in your strategy classes and a `FallbackStrategy` class. You may need to adjust this code to fit the actual structure and methods of your trading strategies.
