Sure, here is a simple Python code that uses the yfinance library to download stock price data and initiate a trade. This example will "buy" one share of Apple stock. Please note that this is a simulated trade and doesn't involve real money.

```python
import yfinance as yf

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2020-1-1', end='2020-1-2')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Simulate buying one share
num_shares = 1
price_per_share = tickerDf['Close'][0]
total_cost = num_shares * price_per_share

print(f"Simulated buying {num_shares} share(s) of {tickerSymbol} for ${total_cost}")
```

Please note that this code is for educational purposes only and should not be used for real trading without proper risk management.

Also, to run this code, you need to have the yfinance library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance
```

This code will not initiate a real trade. To do real trading, you would need to use a trading platform that provides an API, such as Interactive Brokers, Alpaca, or others. You would also need to handle authentication with the API, which often involves setting up API keys and sometimes other steps. This can involve significant complexity and risk, and should only be done if you are comfortable with these aspects.
