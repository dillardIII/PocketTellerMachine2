Here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found:

```python
class TradingAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.backtest_results = None

    def run_backtest(self):
        # Code to run backtest goes here
        # This should update self.backtest_results

    def fallback_strategy(self):
        # Code for fallback strategy goes here
        print("Running fallback strategy...")

    def execute_strategy(self):
        if self.backtest_results is None:
            self.fallback_strategy()
        else:
            # Code to execute main strategy based on backtest results goes here
            print("Executing main strategy...")

# Usage
assistant = TradingAssistant()
assistant.run_backtest()
assistant.execute_strategy()
```

In this code, `run_backtest` method is supposed to run the backtest and update `self.backtest_results`. If `self.backtest_results` is `None` (which means no backtest results were found), `execute_strategy` method runs the fallback strategy by calling `fallback_strategy` method. If backtest results are found, it executes the main strategy.

Please replace the `print` statements and comments with actual code as per your requirements.
