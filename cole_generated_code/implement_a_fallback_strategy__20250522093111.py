Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This function, `backtest_strategy`, takes a `backtest_results` object as an argument. If this object is `None` (i.e., no backtest results are found), the function falls back to a default strategy.

```python
def backtest_strategy(backtest_results):
    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Falling back to default strategy.")
        # Implement your default strategy here
    else:
        # Process your backtest results here
        print("Backtest results found and processed.")
```

This is a very basic implementation. The actual implementation of your default strategy and the processing of your backtest results will depend on the specifics of your trading system.
