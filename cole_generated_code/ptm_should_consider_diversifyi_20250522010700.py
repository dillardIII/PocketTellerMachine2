In order to diversify the portfolio, we need to have some data about the current portfolio and the potential assets to invest in. However, I can provide a simple example of how you might diversify a portfolio using Python. 

In this example, let's assume that PTM currently has all its investments in a single stock. We'll use the `yfinance` library to download historical market data from Yahoo finance.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assume PTM's current portfolio is 100% invested in Apple
current_portfolio = ['AAPL']

# Potential assets to diversify into
potential_assets = ['GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'FB']

# Download historical market data for the current portfolio and potential assets
data = yf.download(current_portfolio + potential_assets, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate daily returns
returns = data['Adj Close'].pct_change()

# Calculate the mean daily return and covariance of daily returns
mean_daily_returns = returns.mean()
cov_matrix = returns.cov()

# Set number of runs of random portfolio weights
num_portfolios = 25000

# Set up array to hold results
results = np.zeros((3,num_portfolios))

for i in range(num_portfolios):
    # Select random weights for portfolio holdings
    weights = np.random.random(5)
    # Rebalance weights to sum to 1
    weights /= np.sum(weights)
    
    # Calculate portfolio return and volatility
    portfolio_return = np.sum(mean_daily_returns * weights) * 252
    portfolio_std_dev = np.sqrt(np.dot(weights.T,np.dot(cov_matrix, weights))) * np.sqrt(252)
    
    # Store results in results array
    results[0,i] = portfolio_return
    results[1,i] = portfolio_std_dev
    # Store Sharpe Ratio (assuming risk-free rate of 0)
    results[2,i] = results[0,i] / results[1,i]

# Convert results array to Pandas DataFrame
results_frame = pd.DataFrame(results.T,columns=['ret','stdev','sharpe'])

# Locate position of portfolio with highest Sharpe Ratio
max_sharpe_port = results_frame.iloc[results_frame['sharpe'].idxmax()]

# Print the weights for the max Sharpe Ratio portfolio
print(max_sharpe_port)
```

This script will output the weights for the portfolio with the highest Sharpe Ratio, which is a measure of risk-adjusted return. This portfolio is the most diversified portfolio with the highest potential return for a given level of risk.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real portfolio diversification involves considering many other factors such as the correlation between assets, the investor's risk tolerance and investment horizon, etc.
