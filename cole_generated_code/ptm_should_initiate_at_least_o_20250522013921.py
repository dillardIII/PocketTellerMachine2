Sure, I can help you with that. However, please note that in order to initiate a trade, we need to connect to a trading API. Here's a simple example using the Alpaca API, which is a commission-free trading platform. 

Firstly, you need to install the Alpaca API. You can do this using pip:

```python
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Here's a simple Python script that initiates a trade:

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Specify the stock we want to trade and the number of shares
symbol = 'AAPL'
qty = 1

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock
order = api.submit_order(
    symbol=symbol,
    qty=qty,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)

print(f"Submitted order to buy {qty} share(s) of {symbol}")
```

Please replace '<APCA-API-KEY-ID>' and '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>' with your actual Alpaca API key ID and secret key. 

This script will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock. The order is a market order, which means it will be executed at the best available price in the market.

Please note that this is a very basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would likely want to implement more complex trading strategies and risk management techniques. Also, this script uses Alpaca's paper trading API, which simulates trades but does not actually execute them in the real market. To execute real trades, you would need to use Alpaca's live trading API and ensure you are in compliance with all relevant regulations.
