Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. The fallback strategy could be anything, but in this case, I am assuming that we will just print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume backtest() is a function that takes a strategy and returns backtest results
    results = backtest(strategy)
    
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Implement your fallback strategy here
        # In this case, the fallback strategy is to return an empty dictionary
        return {}
    
    return results
```

Please replace the `backtest()` function and the fallback strategy with the actual implementation according to your application.
