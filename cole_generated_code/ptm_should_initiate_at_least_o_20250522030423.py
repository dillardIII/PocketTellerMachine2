Sure, here is a simple example of a Python code that initiates a trade. This code uses a hypothetical trading API.

```python
import requests
import json

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, base_url, api_key):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.api_key = api_key

    def initiate_trade(self, symbol, qty, side, type, time_in_force):
        url = f"{self.base_url}/v2/orders"
        headers = {
            "APCA-API-KEY-ID": self.api_key,
            "APCA-API-SECRET-KEY": "your_secret_key"
        }
        data = {
            "symbol": symbol,
            "qty": qty,
            "side": side,
            "type": type,
            "time_in_force": time_in_force
        }
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
        return response.json()

ptm = PTM("https://paper-api.alpaca.markets", "your_api_key")
trade = ptm.initiate_trade("AAPL", 1, "buy", "market", "gtc")

print(trade)
```

This script creates a `PTM` class that has a method `initiate_trade`. This method sends a POST request to the Alpaca's paper trading API to initiate a trade. The trade is initiated with the provided symbol, quantity, side (buy or sell), type (market or limit), and time in force (gtc or day).

Please replace `"your_api_key"` and `"your_secret_key"` with your actual API key and secret key.

Please note that this is a hypothetical example and might not work in a real-world scenario without modifications. The actual implementation would depend on the specific trading platform and its API that you are using.
