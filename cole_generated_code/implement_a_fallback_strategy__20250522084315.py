Sure, here is a simple example of how you could implement a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this case, I'm assuming that you have a function `run_backtest()` that returns the backtest results and `fallback_strategy()` that will be used when no backtest results are found.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your code to run backtest here
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
    # Your code for fallback strategy here
    pass

def main():
    backtest_results = run_backtest()

    if not backtest_results:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")
        # Your code to handle backtest results here
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` is expected to return `None` or an empty list, dict, etc. when no backtest results are found. If `run_backtest()` returns a non-empty result, it is handled in the `else` clause. If it returns an empty result, `fallback_strategy()` is called.
