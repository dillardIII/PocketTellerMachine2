To initiate at least one trade to gauge market performance, we can create a simple Python script that uses a mock trading API. For this example, let's assume we have a mock API called `MockTradeAPI` that has methods to get the current price of a stock, buy a stock, and sell a stock.

```python
class MockTradeAPI:
    def get_price(self, symbol):
        # This method should return the current price of the stock
        pass

    def buy_stock(self, symbol, quantity):
        # This method should buy a certain quantity of a stock
        pass

    def sell_stock(self, symbol, quantity):
        # This method should sell a certain quantity of a stock
        pass

# Initialize the trading API
api = MockTradeAPI()

# Define the stock symbol and quantity to trade
symbol = 'PTM'
quantity = 1

# Get the current price of the stock
price = api.get_price(symbol)

# Buy the stock
api.buy_stock(symbol, quantity)

# Assume we hold the stock for some time and then sell it
# Get the new price of the stock
new_price = api.get_price(symbol)

# Sell the stock
api.sell_stock(symbol, quantity)

# Calculate the profit or loss
profit_or_loss = new_price - price

# Print the profit or loss
print(f'The profit or loss from trading {symbol} is {profit_or_loss}')
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle various complexities such as handling API errors, dealing with authentication, and more. Also, this example assumes that the buy and sell operations are successful, which may not always be the case in a real trading scenario.
