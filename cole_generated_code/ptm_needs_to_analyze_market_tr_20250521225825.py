To analyze market trends and identify potential trading opportunities, you would need access to historical market data. This data can be obtained from various sources like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, etc. Here is a simple example of how you can use Python to analyze market trends using pandas, yfinance, and matplotlib libraries.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA20'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['MA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a new column 'Signal' such that if MA20>MA50 then buy else sell
data['Signal'] = 0.0  
data['Signal'][data['MA20'] > data['MA50']] = 1.0

# Create a new column 'Position' which is a discrete difference of 'Signal' column
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
# plot close price, short-term and long-term moving averages 
data['Close'].plot(color = 'blue', label= 'Close Price') 
data['MA20'].plot(color = 'red',label = 'Moving Average 20 Days') 
data['MA50'].plot(color = 'green', label = 'Moving Average 50 Days')

# plot 'Buy' signals
plt.plot(data[data['Position'] == 1].index, 
         data['MA20'][data['Position'] == 1], 
         '^' , markersize=10, color='m', label = 'Buy Signal')

# plot 'Sell' signals
plt.plot(data[data['Position'] == -1].index, 
         data['MA20'][data['Position'] == -1], 
         'v' , markersize=10, color='k', label = 'Sell Signal')

plt.ylabel('Price in $', fontsize = 15 )
plt.xlabel('Date', fontsize = 15 )
plt.title('Trading signals - Moving Average Crossover Strategy', fontsize = 20)
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

This code downloads the historical data for the Apple Inc. stock, calculates the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, and generates trading signals based on the crossover strategy. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it generates a buy signal, and when it crosses below, it generates a sell signal. The signals are plotted on the stock price chart.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and real-world trading involves many more factors. You should also be aware that past performance is not indicative of future results.
