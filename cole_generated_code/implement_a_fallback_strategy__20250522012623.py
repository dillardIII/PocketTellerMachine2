Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that you have a function named `run_backtest()` that returns the backtest results and `None` if no results are found. The fallback strategy here is to return a message saying that no backtest results were found.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None:
        # Fallback strategy: return a message
        return "No backtest results found."
    else:
        return results

# Usage
print(get_backtest_results())
```

In this code, the `get_backtest_results()` function runs the backtest and checks the results. If the results are `None`, it returns a message saying that no results were found. Otherwise, it returns the results.

Please note that this is a very basic fallback strategy. Depending on your specific needs, you might want to implement a more complex strategy, such as retrying the backtest, running a different backtest, or alerting the user.
