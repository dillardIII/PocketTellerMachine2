To initiate a trade, we would need to use an API provided by a trading platform. For this example, I'll use the Alpaca API, which is a platform for stock trading. 

First, you need to install the Alpaca API. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Here is a simple Python code to initiate a trade:

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Replace these with your API connection info from the dashboard
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

Please replace `<APCA-API-KEY-ID>` and `<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>` with your actual API keys. 

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock at the current market price. The order type is 'market', which means you want to buy the stock at its current price, and 'gtc' (Good Till Cancelled) means the order will be active until it is manually cancelled.

Please note that this is a simple example and real trading involves a lot more considerations such as checking the current price, the trading volume, your current balance, etc.
