Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trading activity. This code will randomly decide whether to buy or sell a stock, and then calculate the potential profit or loss based on the random price of the stock.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance

    def trade(self):
        action = random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])
        stock_price = random.uniform(10.0, 100.0)  # random stock price between 10 and 100
        quantity = random.randint(1, 10)  # random quantity between 1 and 10

        if action == 'buy':
            cost = stock_price * quantity
            if cost > self.balance:
                print("Not enough balance to buy")
            else:
                self.balance -= cost
                print(f"Bought {quantity} stocks at {stock_price}, total cost: {cost}, remaining balance: {self.balance}")
        else:  # sell
            revenue = stock_price * quantity
            self.balance += revenue
            print(f"Sold {quantity} stocks at {stock_price}, total revenue: {revenue}, remaining balance: {self.balance}")

        return self.balance


# Initialize PTM with a balance of 1000
ptm = PTM(1000)

# Initiate a trade
ptm.trade()
```

Please note that this is a very simplified version of a trading system. In a real-world application, you would need to consider many other factors such as transaction fees, market conditions, and more sophisticated trading strategies.
