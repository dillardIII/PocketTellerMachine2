To complete this task, we would need to use a machine learning model or a complex algorithm to analyze the market conditions. However, here is a simple Python code that simulates how PTM (Program Trading Model) could adjust its trading approach based on market conditions. 

```python
import random

class MarketCondition:
    def __init__(self):
        self.condition = random.choice(['bull', 'bear', 'neutral'])

    def get_condition(self):
        return self.condition

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.market_condition = MarketCondition().get_condition()
        self.trading_approach = self.adjust_trading_approach()

    def adjust_trading_approach(self):
        if self.market_condition == 'bull':
            return 'buy'
        elif self.market_condition == 'bear':
            return 'sell'
        else:
            return 'hold'

    def get_trading_approach(self):
        return self.trading_approach

# Usage
ptm = PTM()
print(f"Market condition: {ptm.market_condition}")
print(f"Trading approach: {ptm.get_trading_approach()}")
```

In this code, we have two classes: `MarketCondition` and `PTM`. `MarketCondition` randomly selects a market condition from 'bull', 'bear', and 'neutral'. `PTM` uses this market condition to adjust its trading approach. If the market is bullish, it decides to buy. If the market is bearish, it decides to sell. If the market is neutral, it decides to hold.

Please note that this is a very simplified version of how a program trading model might work. In reality, the decision to buy, sell, or hold would be based on a much more complex analysis of market conditions.
