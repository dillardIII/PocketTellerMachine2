Analyzing market trends and patterns to identify potential trading opportunities is a complex task that involves machine learning and data analysis. Here is a simple example of how you might approach this task using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn. 

This code is a very basic example and should be expanded upon for real-world use. It uses a simple moving average strategy to identify potential trading opportunities.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# Define the ticker list
tickers_list = ['AAPL', 'WMT', 'IBM', 'MU', 'BA', 'AXP']

# Fetch the data
def get_data(tickers):
    data = pd.DataFrame()
    for ticker in tickers:
        temp = pdr.get_data_yahoo(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")
        temp['Ticker'] = ticker
        data = pd.concat([data, temp])
    return data

data = get_data(tickers_list)

# Calculate the 20 days moving average
data['20_SMA'] = data.groupby('Ticker')['Close'].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(window=20).mean())

# Calculate the 50 days moving average
data['50_SMA'] = data.groupby('Ticker')['Close'].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(window=50).mean())

# Create a function to signal when to buy and sell an asset
def buy_sell(data):
    buy_signal = []
    sell_signal = []
    
    for i in range(len(data)):
        if data['20_SMA'].iloc[i] > data['50_SMA'].iloc[i]:
            buy_signal.append(np.nan)
            sell_signal.append(data['Close'].iloc[i])
        elif data['20_SMA'].iloc[i] < data['50_SMA'].iloc[i]:
            buy_signal.append(data['Close'].iloc[i])
            sell_signal.append(np.nan)
        else:
            buy_signal.append(np.nan)
            sell_signal.append(np.nan)
            
    return (buy_signal, sell_signal)

# Create new columns for 'Buy_Signal_Price' and 'Sell_Signal_Price'
data['Buy_Signal_Price'], data['Sell_Signal_Price'] = buy_sell(data)

print(data)
```

This code fetches historical data for several stocks using the Yahoo Finance API, calculates the 20-day and 50-day moving averages for each stock, and then generates buy and sell signals based on these moving averages. 

When the 20-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average, it's a sell signal, and when it's below, it's a buy signal. These signals are then added to the DataFrame for further analysis.

Please note that this is a very simplistic strategy and should not be used for real trading decisions without further enhancements and testing.
