Creating a Python code to analyze market trends and data is a complex task that involves multiple steps. Here is a simplified version of how you might start to approach this task using the pandas library for data analysis and matplotlib for data visualization. 

This code does not actually predict winning trades, but it can help you analyze market trends by visualizing the moving average of a stock.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as web
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the stock to be analyzed and the range of dates
stock = 'AAPL'
start_date = '01-01-2020'
end_date = '12-31-2020'

# Get stock data from Yahoo Finance
df = web.DataReader(stock, 'yahoo', start_date, end_date)

# Calculate the moving average
df['MA50'] = df['Close'].rolling(50).mean()
df['MA200'] = df['Close'].rolling(200).mean()

# Plot the stock closing price and the moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(df['Close'], label='Stock Price')
plt.plot(df['MA50'], label='50 Day MA')
plt.plot(df['MA200'], label='200 Day MA')
plt.title('Stock Price with Moving Averages')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```

This code will plot the closing price of the stock along with its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. When the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average, it is often seen as a bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it's seen as a bearish signal.

Please note that this is a very simplified approach and real trading algorithms use much more complex analysis and machine learning models to predict market trends.
