In order to initiate a trade, we first need to have a trading platform or a broker. Here, I'll use a python library called `alpaca-trade-api` which is a REST API provided by the Alpaca platform for trading. Please make sure to replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your actual API keys.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# setup alpaca api
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# initiate a trade
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple Inc. (AAPL) at the current market price. The order type is 'gtc' which stands for 'Good Till Cancelled', meaning the order will stay open until it is filled or cancelled.

Please note that this is a paper trading API, which means it simulates trades and doesn't actually buy any real stocks. You should replace the base_url with the actual Alpaca URL if you want to do real trading.

Also, you need to handle the exceptions for the situations when the trade cannot be executed due to various reasons like insufficient funds, market closed, etc.
