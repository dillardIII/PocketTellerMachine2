Sure, I can provide you with a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. However, please note that in a real-world scenario, you would need to use APIs provided by your trading platform and the code would be much more complex. Here is a simple simulation:

```python
import random
import datetime

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, ticker, volume, price, trade_type):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.volume = volume
        self.price = price
        self.trade_type = trade_type
        self.timestamp = datetime.datetime.now()

    def execute_trade(self):
        print(f"Executed {self.trade_type} trade for {self.volume} of {self.ticker} at {self.price} per share at {self.timestamp}")

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trade_history = []

    def initiate_trade(self, ticker, volume, trade_type):
        price = random.uniform(10.0, 200.0)  # Simulating price, in real case it should be fetched from market data
        trade = Trade(ticker, volume, price, trade_type)
        trade.execute_trade()
        self.trade_history.append(trade)

ptm = PTM()
ptm.initiate_trade("AAPL", 100, "BUY")
```

In this code, we have a `Trade` class that represents a trade and a `PTM` class that represents a trading system. The `PTM` class has a method `initiate_trade` that initiates a trade and stores it in the `trade_history`. The `Trade` class has a method `execute_trade` that simulates the execution of a trade.

Please replace the `random.uniform(10.0, 200.0)` with actual price fetching from market data in real-world scenario.
