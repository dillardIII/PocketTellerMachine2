Sure, here is a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic trading strategy. This strategy is based on the Moving Average Crossover, which is a popular strategy in financial markets. It uses pandas for data manipulation and yfinance to download the stock data.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and should not be used for actual trading without proper backtesting and strategy optimization.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# Calculate the short-window simple moving average
short_rolling = tickerDf.rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-window simple moving average
long_rolling = tickerDf.rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create signals
signals = pd.DataFrame(index=tickerDf.index)
signals['signal'] = 0.0
signals['short_mavg'] = short_rolling['Close']
signals['long_mavg'] = long_rolling['Close']

# Generate trading orders
signals['signal'][short_rolling['Close'] > long_rolling['Close']] = 1.0

# Print the DataFrame
print(signals)
```

This code downloads the historical price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from 2010 to 2020. It then calculates the 20-day (short-window) and 100-day (long-window) moving averages of the closing prices. A trading signal is generated when the short-window moving average crosses the long-window moving average. A buy signal (1.0) is generated when the short-window moving average is above the long-window moving average.

Please replace 'AAPL' with the ticker symbol of the stock you are interested in. Also, adjust the start and end dates, and the short and long window periods as per your requirements.
