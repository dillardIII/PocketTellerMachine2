To initiate a trade, we would need to use an API provided by the trading platform. However, as I don't have access to a real trading API, I will write a simple Python function to simulate a trade initiation. 

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # initial balance
        self.trades = []  # list of trades

    def initiate_trade(self, trade_type, amount):
        if trade_type not in ['buy', 'sell']:
            return 'Invalid trade type. Please choose "buy" or "sell".'

        if amount > self.balance:
            return 'Insufficient balance.'

        # simulate price
        price = random.uniform(1.0, 100.0)

        if trade_type == 'buy':
            self.balance -= amount
            self.trades.append(('buy', amount / price, price))
            return 'Buy order executed at price {}'.format(price)

        if trade_type == 'sell':
            # check if we have enough assets to sell
            assets = sum([amount for trade_type, amount, price in self.trades if trade_type == 'buy'])
            if amount > assets:
                return 'Insufficient assets to sell.'
            self.balance += amount * price
            self.trades.append(('sell', amount, price))
            return 'Sell order executed at price {}'.format(price)

# create PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# initiate a trade
print(ptm.initiate_trade('buy', 1000))
```

This code creates a PTM (Portfolio Trading Model) class with methods to initiate buy and sell trades. The `initiate_trade` method checks if the trade type is valid and if there is enough balance or assets to execute the trade. It then simulates a trade by generating a random price and updating the balance and trades list.

Please note that this is a very simplified model and doesn't take into account many factors that would be important in a real trading scenario, such as fees, market conditions, or price fluctuations. Also, the way to increase the chances of wins in trading is not simply to initiate at least one trade, but to make informed decisions based on market analysis and possibly using trading algorithms.
