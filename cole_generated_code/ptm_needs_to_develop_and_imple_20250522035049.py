Sure, here's a simple Python code that implements a basic trading strategy. This strategy is based on a simple moving average (SMA). When the price crosses the SMA from below, it's a signal to buy. When the price crosses the SMA from above, it's a signal to sell.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and may not be profitable in real trading. It's just an example of how a trading strategy could be implemented in Python.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    sma = data.rolling(window=window).mean()
    return sma

def trading_strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    # Calculate the short and long moving averages
    short_sma = calculate_sma(data, short_window)
    long_sma = calculate_sma(data, long_window)

    # Create a 'signal' (invested or not invested) when short moving average crosses the long moving average
    data['signal'] = 0.0
    data['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(short_sma[short_window:] > long_sma[short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

    # Generate trading orders
    data['positions'] = data['signal'].diff()

    return data

# Get the data
data = web.DataReader('AAPL', data_source='yahoo', start='01-01-2020', end='31-12-2020')
data = data['Close']

# Apply the trading strategy
trading_data = trading_strategy(data, 50, 200)

# Print the data
print(trading_data)
```

This code will print a DataFrame that includes the closing price of AAPL, the trading signals (1.0 for buy, 0.0 for hold, and -1.0 for sell), and the positions (1.0 for entering a position, -1.0 for exiting a position, and 0.0 for no action).

Please replace 'AAPL' with the ticker symbol of the stock you want to trade, and adjust the start and end dates as needed. Also, you may want to adjust the short and long window parameters depending on your trading strategy.
