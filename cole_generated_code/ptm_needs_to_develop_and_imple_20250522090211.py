Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code for a trading strategy. This strategy is based on a simple Moving Average Crossover, which is a common trading strategy. Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading strategies can be much more complex.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader.data as web
import datetime

# Define the instruments to download. We would like to see Apple, Microsoft and others.
companies_list = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'GOOG', 'FB']

# Define which online source to use
data_source = 'yahoo'

# Define the start and end dates that we want to see
start_date = '2010-01-01'
end_date = '2020-12-31'

# Use pandas_datareader.data.DataReader to load the desired data
panel_data = web.DataReader(companies_list, data_source, start_date, end_date)

# Calculate the short-window simple moving average
short_rolling = panel_data.rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-window simple moving average
long_rolling = panel_data.rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create signals
signals = pd.DataFrame(index=panel_data.index)
signals['signal'] = 0.0

# Create a 'signal' (invested or not invested) when the short moving average crosses the long moving average, but only for the period greater than the shortest moving average window
signals['signal'][short_rolling['Close'] > long_rolling['Close']] = 1.0

# The difference of the signals gives the actual trading orders
signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

# Print the DataFrame
print(signals)
```

This script will output a DataFrame where a 1 indicates a "buy" order and a -1 indicates a "sell" order. The strategy is to buy when the short-term moving average crosses from below to above the long-term moving average, and to sell when the short term moving average crosses from above to below the long-term moving average.

Please note that this is a simplified example and does not take into account trading fees or other factors that could influence the profitability of this strategy. Also, using historical data does not guarantee future performance. It's always recommended to thoroughly backtest any trading strategy before live trading.
