Sure, here's a basic example of how you might initiate a trade using the Alpaca API, a popular platform for algorithmic trading. Please note that you need to replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your actual keys.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API connection
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Get account info
account = api.get_account()
print(account)

# Check if our account is restricted from trading.
if account.trading_blocked:
    print('Account is currently restricted from trading.')

# Check how much money we have to work with.
print('${} is available as cash'.format(account.cash))

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This script will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock at market price. The `time_in_force='gtc'` parameter means that the order will remain in effect until it is either executed or cancelled, which is known as a "good till cancelled" order.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms can get much more complex. Always be sure to understand the code and the trading strategy before running any trading algorithms.
