Below is a Python function representing an example of a fallback strategy. In this example, not finding backtest results will simply print a statement and return an empty dictionary. Your fallback strategy may be more complex depending on your specific needs.

```python
def run_backtest(strategy):
    # assuming backtest is a function that runs backtest and 
    # returns a dictionary containing backtest results
    try:
        results = backtest(strategy)
    except BacktestNotFound:
        print("No backtest results found for the strategy.")
        results = {} #fallback to an empty dictionary
    
    return results
```

Here, `backtest` is a function that performs backtest and throws `BacktestNotFound` exception when no backtest results are found. `strategy` is the strategy on which backtest is performed.

Please replace `backtest` function and the `strategy` with your own implementations.
