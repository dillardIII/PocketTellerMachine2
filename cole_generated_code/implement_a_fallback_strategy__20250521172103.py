Sure, here is a simple function to run a backtest. It includes a fallback strategy for when no results are found:

```python
def run_backtest(strategy):
    # Backtest the strategy
    try:
        backtest_results = strategy.backtest()
    except NoBacktestResults:
        print("No backtest results found. Running the fallback strategy.")

        # Define a fallback strategy
        fallback_strategy = Strategy()

        # Backtest the fallback strategy
        backtest_results = fallback_strategy.backtest()

    return backtest_results

# Create a strategy
strategy = Strategy()

# Run the backtest
results = run_backtest(strategy)
```

This code assumes that you have a `Strategy` class with a `backtest` method. This method should raise a `NoBacktestResults` exception (you might have to define that your own) when no results are found. The fallback strategy in this case is just another instance of the `Strategy` class. You'll need to update this code to suit your actual needs and architecture.

Please note that `NoBacktestResults` is a custom exception and also you need to define and implement `Strategy` as per your requirements.
