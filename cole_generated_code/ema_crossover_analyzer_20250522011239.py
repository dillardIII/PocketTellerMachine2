Sure, here is a simple Python code that uses the `pandas` library to calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and analyze the crossover points. This code assumes that you have a pandas DataFrame `df` with a 'Close' column for closing prices.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Define the periods for short-term and long-term EMAs
short_period = 12
long_period = 26

# Calculate short-term EMA
df['Short_EMA'] = df['Close'].ewm(span=short_period, adjust=False).mean()

# Calculate long-term EMA
df['Long_EMA'] = df['Close'].ewm(span=long_period, adjust=False).mean()

# Create a column for the signal
df['Signal'] = 0.0  
df['Signal'][short_period:] = np.where(df['Short_EMA'][short_period:] > df['Long_EMA'][short_period:], 1.0, 0.0)

# Generate trading orders
df['Position'] = df['Signal'].diff()

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```

In this code, the 'Signal' column contains 1.0 when the short-term EMA is above the long-term EMA (which could be interpreted as a buy signal) and 0.0 when it's below (a sell signal). The 'Position' column indicates the points where the EMA crossover occurs: a 1.0 means a crossover from below (buy order) and a -1.0 means a crossover from above (sell order).

Please note that this is a simple example and real trading systems would require much more complex logic and risk management. Also, you need to handle the data preprocessing part according to your data source.
