Sure, I will write a simple python code for a hypothetical trading strategy using a basic moving average. This code will not really perform trading since this would require integration with an actual live data feed and access to a trading account which is beyond the scope of this domain. Assume we have historical closing prices which would be used to decide trading.

Let's use arrays to represent the closing price of stocks and we will calculate moving average over the last 'n' days. We'll buy when the price crosses above the moving average and sell when it crosses below. The strategy will enter a trade or exit based on these crossing conditions.

For example, let's use a 10-day moving average strategy:

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_moving_average(data, window):
    weights = np.ones(window) / window
    return np.convolve(data, weights, mode='valid')

def execute_strategy(prices):
    # Calculate 10-day moving average
    moving_avg = calculate_moving_average(prices, 10)

    # Assuming we are not in the market at the start
    in_market = False
    wins = 0
    losses = 0

    for i in range(10, len(prices)):
        # Buy if price crosses above MA
        if prices[i] > moving_avg[i-10] and not in_market:
            in_market = True
            entry_price = prices[i]

        # Sell if price crosses below MA or we reach the end of available data
        elif (prices[i] < moving_avg[i-10] or i == len(prices) - 1) and in_market:
            in_market = False
            exit_price = prices[i]

            # If exit price > entry price => win, else loss
            if exit_price > entry_price:
                wins += 1
            else:
                losses += 1

    return wins, losses

# Assuming we have historical closing prices
closing_prices = np.random.rand(100) # Random data, replace with actual closing prices
wins, losses = execute_strategy(closing_prices)

print("Wins: ", wins)
print("Losses: ", losses)
```

Remember to replace the random closing_prices data with actual data from your trading system. Also, bear in mind this is a very naive strategy for illustrative purposes without any considerations for transaction costs, slippage, and many other factors you should account for in a real trading system.
