Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, the fallback strategy is to simply print a message saying that no backtest results were found.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # Assume this function returns the backtest results for a given strategy
    # For the sake of this example, let's say it returns None if no results are found
    results = get_backtest_results(strategy)

    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Process the results
        print(results)

def get_backtest_results(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for the actual function that gets the backtest results
    # It should return None if no results are found
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Please revise your strategy.")

# Test the backtest function with a strategy
backtest("my_strategy")
```

In this code, the `backtest` function first tries to get the backtest results for a given strategy. If no results are found (i.e., `get_backtest_results` returns `None`), it calls the `fallback_strategy` function. The `fallback_strategy` function then simply prints a message saying that no backtest results were found. If results are found, they are processed as usual.

Please replace the `get_backtest_results` and `fallback_strategy` functions with your own implementation.
