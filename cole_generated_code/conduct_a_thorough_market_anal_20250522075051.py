To conduct a thorough market analysis, we would need a lot of data and sophisticated algorithms which are beyond the scope of this platform. However, I can provide a simple example of how you could use Python to analyze stock prices using pandas, yfinance (Yahoo Finance), and matplotlib libraries.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading requires much more sophisticated analysis and risk management.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-1-25')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Plot the close prices
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.plot(tickerDf['Close'])
plt.title('Historical Stock Value')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Stock Price')
plt.show()

# Calculate the 20 days Moving Average
tickerDf['MA20'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Plot the close prices and Moving Average
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.plot(tickerDf['Close'])
plt.plot(tickerDf['MA20'], color='r', linestyle='--')
plt.title('Historical Stock Value with 20 days MA')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Stock Price')
plt.show()
```

This code will download the historical prices for Apple's stock, calculate the 20-day moving average, and plot the prices and the moving average. The moving average can be used to identify potential trading opportunities: when the price crosses the moving average from below, it might be a good time to buy, and when it crosses from above, it might be a good time to sell.

Please note that this is a very simplistic strategy and should not be used for real trading without further enhancements.
