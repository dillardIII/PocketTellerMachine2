Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume `run_backtest` is a function that runs the backtest and returns results
    results = run_backtest(strategy)
    
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy.")
        # Fallback strategy: return an empty dictionary
        return {}
    
    return results

# Test the function with a strategy
strategy = "Strategy 1"
backtest_strategy(strategy)
```

In this code, `run_backtest` is a hypothetical function that runs the backtest and returns the results. If the results are empty (i.e., the backtest didn't return any results), it prints a message and returns an empty dictionary as a fallback.

Please replace `run_backtest` with your actual function to run the backtest and adjust the fallback strategy as needed.
