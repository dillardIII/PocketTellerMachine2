Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, the fallback strategy is to simply print a message and return an empty dictionary. 

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume we have a function `run_backtest` that runs backtest and returns results
    try:
        results = run_backtest(strategy)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Backtest failed with error: {str(e)}")
        results = None

    # Fallback strategy: if no results, print a message and return an empty dictionary
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Fallback strategy activated.")
        results = {}

    return results
```

In this code, we first try to run the backtest with the given strategy. If an exception occurs (which might happen if there's a problem with the strategy or the backtest function), we catch it and set `results` to `None`. 

Then, we check if `results` is `None` or empty. If it is, we print a message and set `results` to an empty dictionary as a fallback. 

This is a very basic fallback strategy. Depending on your needs, you might want to implement a more complex fallback, such as trying a different backtest strategy, logging the error for later analysis, or alerting the user.
