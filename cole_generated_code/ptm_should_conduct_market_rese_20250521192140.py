To conduct market research for potential trading opportunities, we can use Python libraries like pandas, yfinance, and matplotlib. Here's a simple example of how you might use these libraries to analyze stock data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-1-25')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Plot the close price of the stock
tickerDf['Close'].plot(title="Close price of " + tickerSymbol)
plt.show()
```

This script gets historical price data for Apple's stock (ticker symbol 'AAPL') from 2010 to 2020, and then plots the closing price over time. You can replace 'AAPL' with the ticker symbol of any company you're interested in.

Please note that this is a very basic example of market research. Real-world market research would involve much more complex analysis and would take into account many other factors. 

Also, please note that this script uses the yfinance library, which is not an official Yahoo! product. Yahoo! does not provide any guarantee about the availability or accuracy of its data. Always verify your data from multiple sources before making any trading decisions.
