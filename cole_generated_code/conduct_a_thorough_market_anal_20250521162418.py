Performing a thorough market analysis requires access to various data sources and might involve complex algorithms. Below is a simple example using Python for a basic stock market analysis:

First off, you need the `yfinance` library, which needs to be installed via pip.

```
pip install yfinance
pip install pandas
```

Then you can use the following Python code:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

def calculate_market_opportunity(symbol):
    data = yf.Ticker(symbol)

    hist = data.history(period="5d")

    close = hist["Close"]
    volume = hist["Volume"]

    # Calculating the change in closing prices day by day
    close_diff = close.diff()

    # Identify the potential opportunities. 
    # For instance, if stock closes higher than previous day with higher volume
    opportunities = (close_diff > 0) & (volume > volume.shift())

    return opportunities

# Analyze Apple Inc.'s stock for potential opportunities
symbol = "AAPL"
print(calculate_market_opportunity(symbol))
```

Note that this is a very basic analysis using price and volume only, and can be improved. Use this script as a starting point and include more factors like company's fundamentals, technical analysis, sentimental analysis, and macroeconomic indicators depending upon your trading strategy. All these factors require additional data sources and computational tools which can't be covered in this short example. 

Additionally, this code simply identifies days where the closing price was higher than the previous day and the volume increased, considering them as potential trading opportunities. In a real trading strategy, you would usually include more context and additional conditions. Please use this code for educational purposes and not actual trading.
