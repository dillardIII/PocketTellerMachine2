To diversify a portfolio, you would typically want to invest in a variety of different assets such as stocks, bonds, commodities, etc. Here is a simple Python code that simulates diversifying a portfolio by randomly selecting assets to invest in:

```python
import random

class Portfolio:
    def __init__(self):
        self.assets = []

    def add_asset(self, asset):
        self.assets.append(asset)

    def diversify(self):
        diversified_portfolio = random.sample(self.assets, len(self.assets))
        return diversified_portfolio

# Define assets
assets = ['Stocks', 'Bonds', 'Commodities', 'Real Estate', 'Cryptocurrency']

# Initialize portfolio
ptm_portfolio = Portfolio()

# Add assets to portfolio
for asset in assets:
    ptm_portfolio.add_asset(asset)

# Diversify portfolio
diversified_portfolio = ptm_portfolio.diversify()

print("Diversified Portfolio: ", diversified_portfolio)
```

This code creates a `Portfolio` class with methods to add assets and diversify the portfolio. The diversify method uses the `random.sample` function to randomly select assets from the list, simulating the diversification process.

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, diversification would involve complex strategies and risk assessments.
