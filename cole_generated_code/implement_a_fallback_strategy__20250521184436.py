Sure, here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that runs a backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, it runs a fallback strategy.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function runs a backtest and returns the results
    # For now it returns None to simulate no results found
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function implements the fallback strategy
    print("Running fallback strategy...")

def main():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")

main()
```

In this code, the `run_backtest()` function is supposed to run a backtest and return the results. For now, it just returns `None` to simulate a situation where no backtest results are found.

The `fallback_strategy()` function is where you would implement your fallback strategy. For now, it just prints a message saying that the fallback strategy is running.

The `main()` function runs the backtest and checks if any results were found. If no results were found, it runs the fallback strategy.

Please replace the `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` functions with your actual backtest and fallback strategy implementations.
