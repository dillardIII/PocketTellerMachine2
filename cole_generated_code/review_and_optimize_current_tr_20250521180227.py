Reviewing and optimizing trading algorithms is an involved process based on the detailed analysis of the existing algorithms. This process may involve tweaking parameters, using different methods for prediction, or employing different data processing techniques.

However, without the specific trading algorithm, it's impossible to come up with a concrete Python code that caters to this request. A generic Python code for a simple trading bot using pandas, numpy, and sklearn could look like this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

def calculate_input_data(df):
    # calculate technical indicators
    df['SMA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=14).mean()
    df['Corr'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=10).corr(df['Volume'])
    df['RSI'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=10).apply(rsi)
    df['Open-Close'] = df['Open'] - df['Close'].shift(1)
    df['Open-Open'] = df['Open'] - df['Open'].shift(1)
    df = df.dropna()
    return df

def rsi(values):
    # calculate RSI, a common technical stock indicator
    up = values[values>0].mean()
    down = -1*values[values<0].mean()
    return 100 * up / (up + down)

# optimize model parameters based on cross-validation
def optimize_model(X, y):
    # use Random Forest Regressor for prediction
    clf = RandomForestRegressor()
    param_grid = {
        'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
        'max_depth': [None, 10, 30, 50],
        'min_samples_split': [2, 4, 6]
    }
    CV_clf = GridSearchCV(clf, param_grid, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error', cv=5)
    CV_clf.fit(X, y)
    print('Best parameters:', CV_clf.best_params_)
    return CV_clf

def main():
    # load historical prices
    prices = pd.read_csv('historical_prices.csv')

    # pre-process data
    prices = calculate_input_data(prices)

    # train
    input_feature = ['Open-Close', 'Open-Open', 'Volume']
    X = prices[input_feature]
    y = prices['Close']
    model = optimize_model(X, y)

    # predict
    prediction = model.predict(X)
    print('Prediction:', prediction)

main()
```

Remember, this is a simple, generic example and real-world trading algorithms could be much more complex including ML models, real-time data streams, etc. Please replace `'historical_prices.csv'`  with your own data.

Additionally, performance enhancement could also be achieved via other ways like parallel processing (if the algorithm supports it), efficient data handling (using efficient data structures), using faster libraries/methods, hardware improvement, etc.
