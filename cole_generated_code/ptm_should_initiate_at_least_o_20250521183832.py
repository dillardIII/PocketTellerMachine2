Here's a simple example of how you might initiate a trade using the Alpaca API, a popular choice for algorithmic trading. This code will buy 1 share of Apple stock.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up API connection
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

Please replace `<APCA-API-KEY-ID>` and `<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>` with your own Alpaca API key and secret. This code uses Alpaca's paper trading API, which simulates trades but does not actually execute them, making it safe for testing.

Remember, you should have a well-tested strategy before initiating trades in a live environment, and you should always be aware of the risks involved in trading.
