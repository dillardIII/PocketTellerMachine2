To analyze market trends and make informed decisions, we would need to use some form of machine learning or data analysis. Here's a simple example of how you might use Python to analyze stock market data using the pandas library. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Assuming you have market data in a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Let's say we're interested in predicting the 'Close' price, and we think 'Open', 'High', 'Low' prices can be our features
features = ['Open', 'High', 'Low']
X = df[features]
y = df['Close']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()  
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use our model to predict
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# See the difference between actual and predicted value
df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test, 'Predicted': y_pred})
print(df)
```

This is a very basic example and might not give very accurate predictions. For real-world trading, you would need a much more sophisticated model that takes into account more factors and uses more advanced techniques. 

Also, it's important to note that stock market prediction is very risky and should be done with caution. Even the most advanced models can't predict the market with 100% accuracy.
