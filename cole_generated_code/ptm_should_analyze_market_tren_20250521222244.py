To analyze market trends and patterns, we need historical market data. We can use libraries like pandas for data handling, numpy for numerical computations, matplotlib for plotting, and sklearn for machine learning (to identify patterns).

Here is a simple example of how you might start to analyze market trends and patterns using Python. In this example, we'll use the pandas_datareader library to get historical market data from Yahoo Finance.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world financial analysis would require a much more complex approach.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as pdr
from datetime import datetime
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Define the instruments to download. We would like to see Apple, Microsoft and the S&P500 index.
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'SPY']

# Define which online source one should use
data_source = 'yahoo'

# We would like all available data from 01/01/2000 until 12/31/2016.
start_date = datetime(2000, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime(2016, 12, 31)

# User pandas_reader.data.DataReader to load the desired data. As simple as that.
panel_data = pdr.DataReader(tickers, data_source, start_date, end_date)

# Getting just the adjusted closing prices. This will return a Pandas DataFrame
# The index in this DataFrame is the major index of the panel_data.
close = panel_data['Adj Close']

# Getting all weekdays between start_date and end_date
all_weekdays = pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date, freq='B')

# How do we align the existing prices in adj_close with our new set of dates?
# All we need to do is reindex close using all_weekdays as the new index
close = close.reindex(all_weekdays)

# Reindexing will insert missing values (NaN) for the dates that were not present
# in the original set. We can fill the missing values by replacing them with the latest available price for each instrument.
close = close.fillna(method='ffill')

# Compute the returns of the stocks
returns = close.pct_change()

# Drop the missing values
returns = returns.dropna()

# Identify potential trading opportunities using K-Means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0).fit(returns)
labels = kmeans.labels_

# Plot the results
plt.scatter(returns['AAPL'], returns['MSFT'], c=labels)
plt.show()
```

This script downloads the historical data for Apple, Microsoft, and the S&P500 index. It then calculates the daily returns of these stocks and applies K-Means clustering to these returns. The script finally plots the results, with different colors representing different clusters. The idea is that similar trading opportunities (in terms of returns) will be grouped together.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world financial analysis would require a much more complex approach.
