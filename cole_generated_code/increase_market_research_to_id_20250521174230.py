In order to accomplish this task, you would likely need to interface with a financial API, perform some data processing and analysis to predict the future profitability of certain stocks.

Here is a simple example of how you might do this using `pandas`, `yfinance` and `fbprophet`. The example is not likely to predict profitable trades with high accuracy, but it will give you a basic idea of how you might approach this problem.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from fbprophet import Prophet

# download historical market data
hist_data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# prepare the data for Prophet
prophet_df = hist_data.reset_index()
prophet_df = prophet_df[["Date","Close"]] 
prophet_df.rename(columns = {"Date":"ds","Close":"y"},inplace = True)

# build and train the model
model = Prophet(daily_seasonality = True) 
model.fit(prophet_df)

# forecast the future
future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=1) 
forecast = model.predict(future)

# analyze the forecast
last_row = forecast.iloc[-1]
if last_row['yhat'] > last_row['yhat_lower'] and last_row['yhat'] > last_row['yhat_upper']:
    print("Based on our analysis, AAPL could be a potentially profitable trade tomorrow.")
else:
    print("Based on our analysis, AAPL does not appear to be a potentially profitable trade tomorrow.")
```

In this example, we're just downloading historical data for Apple (AAPL), training a Prophet model on this data, and predicting tomorrow's closing price. Note that this is a greatly oversimplified example. A real trading system would likely incorporate many more factors and use a more sophisticated prediction model.
