To implement a fallback strategy while using the Python programming language, you could set up a simple if-else statement. This code checks if backtest results exist. If they do, it continues with the program. If not, it follows a fallback procedure. 

We don't know the details of your program, but in a generic sense, it could be implemented as follows:

```python
def backtest_results_exist(backtest_results):
    # check if backtest_results is empty or None
    if backtest_results:
        return True
    return False

def perform_backtest():
    backtest_results = fetch_backtest_results()  # function to fetch backtest results

    if backtest_results_exist(backtest_results):
        # process the fetched results
        process_backtest_results(backtest_results)
    else:
        # fallback strategy
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy.")
        execute_fallback_strategy()  # function to execute fallback strategy
```
Of course, you should replace the `fetch_backtest_results()`, `process_backtest_results()`, and `execute_fallback_strategy()` functions with whatever procedures you have in mind. Without knowing what those might be, it's impossible to give a more detailed answer.

Remember that it's a good practice to handle such situations - when the needed data might not be available - to avoid unexpected behaviors and errors.
