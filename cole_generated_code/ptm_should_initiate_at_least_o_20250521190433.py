Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code that simulates a trading bot. However, please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading involves complex algorithms and risk management strategies. 

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance
        self.stock = 0

    def trade(self, price):
        # Randomly decide to buy or sell
        action = random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])

        if action == 'buy':
            # Buy as much as possible
            quantity = self.balance // price
            self.balance -= quantity * price
            self.stock += quantity
            print(f"Bought {quantity} stocks at price {price}")

        elif action == 'sell' and self.stock > 0:
            # Sell all
            self.balance += self.stock * price
            self.stock = 0
            print(f"Sold all stocks at price {price}")

        else:
            print("No action")

        print(f"Current balance: {self.balance}, current stock: {self.stock}")

# Initialize PTM with a balance of 10000
ptm = PTM(10000)

# Simulate trading with random prices between 90 and 110
for _ in range(10):
    price = random.uniform(90, 110)
    ptm.trade(price)
```

In this code, a PTM (Python Trading Machine) class is defined with methods to buy and sell stocks. The `trade` method randomly decides to buy or sell. If the action is to buy, it buys as many stocks as possible with the current balance. If the action is to sell and there are stocks in possession, it sells all stocks. If the action is to sell but there are no stocks, no action is taken. The trading is simulated with random prices between 90 and 110.
