To analyze market trends and patterns, we can use libraries like pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for data visualization, and yfinance to download the stock data. Here is a simple Python script that uses moving averages to identify potential trading opportunities:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    return data.rolling(window=window).mean()

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def plot_data(data, sma, ema):
    plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.plot(data['Close'],label='Close Price')
    plt.plot(sma,label='SMA')
    plt.plot(ema,label='EMA')
    plt.legend(loc=2)
    plt.show()

def analyze_stock(symbol, sma_period, ema_period):
    data = yf.download(symbol, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")
    data['SMA'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], sma_period)
    data['EMA'] = calculate_ema(data['Close'], ema_period)
    plot_data(data, data['SMA'], data['EMA'])

analyze_stock('AAPL', 50, 200)
```

In this script, we first define functions to calculate the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). We then define a function to plot the close price, SMA, and EMA. Finally, we define a function to download the stock data, calculate the SMA and EMA, and plot the data.

This script analyzes the stock data for Apple (AAPL) from 2020 to 2022, using a 50-day period for the SMA and a 200-day period for the EMA. The SMA and EMA are common technical indicators used by traders to identify potential trading opportunities. When the SMA crosses above the EMA, it could be a bullish signal, and when it crosses below the EMA, it could be a bearish signal.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors.
