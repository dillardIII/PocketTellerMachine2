Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, I'm assuming that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that runs your backtest and returns the results. If no results are found (i.e., `run_backtest()` returns `None`), the fallback strategy is executed.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    # Return the results of the backtest, or None if no results are found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your fallback strategy here
    # This might involve running a different backtest, alerting the user, etc.
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")

def execute_strategy():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Process your backtest results here
        print("Backtest results found and processed.")

# Run the strategy
execute_strategy()
```

This is a very basic example and you would need to adapt it to fit your specific needs. For example, you might want to include more detailed error handling, or you might want to return the results of the fallback strategy instead of just printing a message.
