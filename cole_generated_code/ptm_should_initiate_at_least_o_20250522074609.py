To initiate a trade and gain insights on market behavior, we need to connect to a trading API, execute a trade, and then analyze the market data. Here's a simple example using the Alpaca API, a commission-free trading platform. 

Please note that you need to replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your own API keys.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi
import pandas as pd

# Set up the API connection
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)

# Get daily price data for AAPL over the last 5 trading days
barset = api.get_barset('AAPL', 'day', limit=5)
aapl_bars = barset['AAPL']

# Create a pandas DataFrame and print it
df = pd.DataFrame([(bar.t, bar.o, bar.h, bar.l, bar.c, bar.v) for bar in aapl_bars], columns=['time', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'])
print(df)
```

This script will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock and then retrieve and print the daily price data for the last 5 trading days. This data can be used to gain insights into the market behavior for Apple stock.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms should consider many more factors, like handling failures, managing risk, and optimizing execution.
