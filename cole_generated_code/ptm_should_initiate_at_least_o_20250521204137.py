Sure, here's a simple Python code that uses the Alpaca API to initiate a trade. This code will buy 1 share of Apple stock.

Please replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your actual Alpaca API key and secret.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Authentication
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Initiate a trade
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code will initiate a trade in a paper trading environment, which means it's simulated and no real money is involved. It's a good way to gather data and insights for future strategies without risking real money.

Please note that you need to install the `alpaca-trade-api` Python package to use this code. You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Also, remember that trading involves risk, and this code is a very basic example. In a real scenario, you would need to implement more complex strategies, risk management, and error handling.
