Sure, here is a simple implementation of an EMA Crossover Analyzer in Python using the pandas library. Please note that this is a basic implementation and may need to be adjusted based on your specific requirements.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def ema_crossover_analyzer(stock_symbol, short_window, long_window):
    # Download historical data as dataframe
    data = yf.download(stock_symbol, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

    # Calculate short and long EMA
    data['short_EMA'] = calculate_ema(data['Close'], short_window)
    data['long_EMA'] = calculate_ema(data['Close'], long_window)

    # Create signals
    data['signal'] = 0.0
    data['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(data['short_EMA'][short_window:] > data['long_EMA'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

    # Generate trading orders
    data['positions'] = data['signal'].diff()

    # Print data
    print(data)

# Test the function
ema_crossover_analyzer('AAPL', 12, 26)
```

This script downloads historical data for a given stock symbol, calculates the short and long EMA (Exponential Moving Average), generates signals when these two cross, and finally generates trading orders based on these signals. The trading orders are simply the difference between the current and previous signal. 

Please note that you need to install yfinance library to download the data from Yahoo finance. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance
```

Also, this script uses closing prices to calculate EMA. If you want to use other prices (like open, high, low), you need to adjust the script accordingly.
