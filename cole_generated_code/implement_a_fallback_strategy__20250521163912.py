Sure. Here's a simple Python code using a function to simulate backtest results. Here we are assuming that the variable `backtest_results` is a dictionary which would contain results if backtest was successful:

```python
def backtest_strategy():
    backtest_results = {}  # Assumed to be loaded with the backtesting results

    if not backtest_results:
        print('No backtest results found! Applying fallback strategy...')

        # Fallback strategy implemented here:
        # This is a placeholder implementation and should be replaced
        # with the actual fallback strategy as per your requirements
        fallback_strategy = {
            'buy': 'hold',
            'sell': 'hold',
            'hold': 'buy'
        }

        return fallback_strategy

    else:
        print('Backtest results found.')
        # Continue with the usual process using backtest results

# Initialize the backtest strategy
backtest_strategy()
```

In this example, if the `backtest_results` dictionary is empty (indicating that no backtest results were found), the fallback strategy is applied. The fallback strategy here is a simple example where 'buy' action is turned into 'hold', 'sell' into 'hold', and 'hold' into 'buy'. This is just a dummy implementation, you should replace it with the real fallback logic according to your use-case.
