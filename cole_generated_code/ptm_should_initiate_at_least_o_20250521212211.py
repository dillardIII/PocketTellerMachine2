Sure, here is a simple Python code that represents a trading bot. This bot will initiate at least one trade. Please note that this is a very basic example and doesn't include any real trading strategies.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 1000  # initial balance
        self.trades = 0  # number of trades

    def trade(self):
        # This function represents a trade. In a real-world scenario, you would use an API to trade.
        self.trades += 1
        outcome = random.choice(['win', 'lose'])  # random outcome
        if outcome == 'win':
            self.balance += 100  # win $100
        else:
            self.balance -= 100  # lose $100
        print(f'Trade {self.trades}: {outcome}! Balance: {self.balance}')

    def run(self):
        # This function runs the bot. It will always make at least one trade.
        self.trade()
        while self.balance > 0:
            decision = random.choice(['trade', 'stop'])  # random decision
            if decision == 'trade':
                self.trade()
            else:
                print(f'Stopping after {self.trades} trades. Final balance: {self.balance}')
                break

# create a PTM and run it
ptm = PTM()
ptm.run()
```

In this example, the PTM (Python Trading Machine) will always make at least one trade when it runs. After that, it will randomly decide whether to trade or stop, until it runs out of money. If it decides to trade, it will either win or lose $100, chosen at random.
