Sure! To diversify trading strategies, we could look into different strategies such as Mean Reversion, Momentum, and Pair Trading. I'm going to provide simple examples for each of these strategies. All of these examples are based on historical data and should not be treated as an investment advice.

1. Mean Reversion:

Mean reversion believes that the price of the stock will return to its mean or average price after moving too far in one direction.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker
data = yf.download('AAPL','2016-01-01','2019-08-01')
 
# calculate Simple Moving Average with 20 days window
sma = data.rolling(window=20).mean()

# calculate the standar deviation
rstd = data.rolling(window=20).std()

data['lower_band'] = sma - 2 * rstd
data['upper_band'] = sma + 2 * rstd
data['mid_band'] = sma

# create signals
data['long_entry'] = data['low'] < data['lower_band']   
data['long_exit'] = data['high'] > data['mid_band']

data['positions_long'] = data['long_entry'].astype(int)
data['positions_long'][data['long_exit']] = 0
```

2. Momentum Trading:

Momentum investing involves a strategy to capitalize on the continuance of an existing market trend.

```python
# calculate momentum
data['momentum'] = data['close'] - data['close'].shift(4)

# create signals
data['long_entry'] = data['momentum'] > 0   
data['long_exit'] = data['momentum'] < 0

data['positions_long'] = data['long_entry'].astype(int)
data['positions_long'][data['long_exit']] = 0
```

3. Pair Trading:

Pairs trading is a market neutral trading strategy enabling traders to profit from virtually any market conditions: uptrend, downtrend, or sideways movement.

```python
# Download historical data for desired pair
data1 = yf.download('AAPL','2016-01-01','2019-08-01')
data2 = yf.download('MSFT','2016-01-01','2019-08-01')

# calculate the spread
spread = data1['Close'] - data2['Close']

# calculate Simple Moving Average with 60 days window
sma60 = spread.rolling(window=60).mean()

# calculate the standar deviation
std60 = spread.rolling(window=60).std()

# create signals
long_entry = spread < sma60 - 1.0 * std60   
long_exit = spread > sma60

positions_long = long_entry.astype(int)
positions_long[long_exit] = 0
```

Again, these are just sample codes, in real scenario you would need to take into account transaction costs, slippage, risk level, etc. Furthermore, you should consider walking-forward optimization and validation on unseen data, not just backtesting on historical data. Always seek advice from your financial advisor before making any investment.
