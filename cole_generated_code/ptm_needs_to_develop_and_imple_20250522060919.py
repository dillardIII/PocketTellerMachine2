Sure, here's a simple example of a Python code that could be used to implement a basic trading strategy. This strategy is based on moving average crossovers, which is a common method used in technical analysis. 

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and real-world trading strategies can be much more complex and would require a lot more considerations such as transaction costs, risk management, etc.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2021-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA10'] = data['Close'].rolling(10).mean()
data['MA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(50).mean()

# Create a 'signals' column
data['Signal'] = 0.0
data['Signal'][data['MA10'] > data['MA50']] = 1.0

# Generate trading orders
data['Order'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Print data
print(data)

# The 'Order' column tells us when to place orders. A value of 1.0 means we should enter a long position, 
# and a value of -1.0 means we should exit our position.
```

In this code, we first download historical data for a specific stock (in this case, Apple Inc.) using the `yfinance` library. We then calculate 10-day and 50-day moving averages of the closing prices. We generate a 'signal' whenever the 10-day moving average crosses above the 50-day moving average, indicating upward momentum. This signal is used to generate trading orders, where a value of 1.0 means we should enter a long position, and a value of -1.0 means we should exit our position.
