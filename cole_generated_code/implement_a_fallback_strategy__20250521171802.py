Here's a simple example of how you could implement a fallback strategy in python:

```python
def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy...")

def run_backtest():
    # Initialize backtest results to None
    backtest_results = None

    # Assuming this function run_backtest() should attempt to find backtest results
    try:
        # your backtest code goes here
        # e.g backtest_results = backtest(my_strategy)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'Error: {e}')

    # If no results found, implement fallback strategy
    if not backtest_results:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found...")
        # your code to handle backtest results goes here

run_backtest()
```

Please replace `# your backtest code goes here` and `# your code to handle backtest results goes here` with your actual code. 

This code tries to execute backtesting, and if it fails (or the results are None), it then implements a fallback strategy. 

Please note it's just a template - you might need to adjust this according to your needs and codebase.
