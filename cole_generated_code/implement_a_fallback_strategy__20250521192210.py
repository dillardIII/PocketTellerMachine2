Sure, here is a simple Python code to implement a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # Assume this function runs a backtest and returns results
    # If no results are found, it returns None
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is your fallback strategy
    # It could be anything: buying a certain stock, holding, etc.
    pass

# Run backtest
results = backtest('my_strategy')

# If no results are found, use fallback strategy
if results is None:
    print("No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy.")
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    print("Backtest results found.")
    # Continue with your normal strategy
```

In this code, we first run a backtest with a certain strategy. If the backtest function returns None (indicating no results were found), we print a message and run the fallback strategy. If results were found, we print a different message and continue with our normal strategy. 

Please replace the `backtest` and `fallback_strategy` functions with your actual implementation.
