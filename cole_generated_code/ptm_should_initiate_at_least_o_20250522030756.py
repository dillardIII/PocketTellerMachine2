Sure, here is a simple example of a Python code that uses the Alpaca API to initiate a trade. This code will buy 1 share of Apple stock. Please replace "YOUR_API_KEY" and "YOUR_SECRET_KEY" with your actual API key and secret key.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

api = tradeapi.REST('YOUR_API_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

def initiate_trade():
    symbol = 'AAPL'  # Symbol for Apple Inc.
    qty = 1  # Number of shares to buy
    order = api.submit_order(
        symbol=symbol,
        qty=qty,
        side='buy',
        type='market',
        time_in_force='gtc'
    )
    print(f"Submitted order to buy {qty} share(s) of {symbol}")

initiate_trade()
```

This code will initiate a trade in the paper trading environment (simulated environment for practice), not the live trading environment. Please be aware that trading involves risk, and this code is provided as an example and not as financial advice.

Also, note that you need to install the `alpaca-trade-api` Python package to use this code. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```
