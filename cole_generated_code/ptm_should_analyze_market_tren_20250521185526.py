Creating a Python program that can analyze market trends and patterns is a complex task that involves a lot of data analysis and potentially machine learning. Here is a very basic example of how you might start to approach this problem using Python and pandas, a popular data analysis library.

This example assumes that you have historical market data in a CSV file with columns for 'Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', and 'Volume'.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Calculate the moving average
data['MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Define a simple trading strategy: buy when the price is above the moving average, sell when it's below
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['Close'] > data['MA'])
data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['Close'] < data['MA'])

# Print potential trading opportunities
print(data[data['Buy_Signal']])
print(data[data['Sell_Signal']])

# Predicting future prices using linear regression
data['Price_After_Month'] = data['Close'].shift(-30)

# Removing NA rows
data = data.dropna()

# Creating train-test dataset
X = data[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume']]
y = data['Price_After_Month']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Training the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Testing the model
predicted_price = model.predict(X_test)
print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, predicted_price))
```

This code will print out the days where the closing price was above or below the moving average, which could be potential buy or sell signals. It also predicts future prices using linear regression.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take many more factors into account. Always consult with a financial advisor before making trading decisions.
