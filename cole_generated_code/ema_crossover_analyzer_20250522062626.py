Sure, here is a simple implementation of an EMA Crossover Analyzer using Python and the pandas library. This code calculates the EMA (Exponential Moving Average) for two different periods and then checks for crossovers.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as pdr
from datetime import datetime

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Gather data from Yahoo Finance
data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickerSymbol, start=datetime(2020, 1, 1), end=datetime.now())

# Calculate the short-window simple moving average
short_ema = data.Close.ewm(span=12, adjust=False).mean()

# Calculate the long-window simple moving average
long_ema = data.Close.ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()

# Create signals
data['signal'] = 0.0
data['signal'][short_ema > long_ema] = 1.0
data['signal'][short_ema < long_ema] = -1.0

# Generate trading orders
data['positions'] = data['signal'].diff()

# Print the DataFrame
print(data)
```

In this code, we first download the historical data for a specific ticker symbol (in this case, 'AAPL' for Apple Inc.) from Yahoo Finance. We then calculate the short-window (12-day) and long-window (26-day) EMA for the closing prices.

We create a new column 'signal' in the DataFrame, which is set to 1.0 when the short-window EMA is greater than the long-window EMA (indicating a bullish market) and -1.0 when the short-window EMA is less than the long-window EMA (indicating a bearish market).

Finally, we generate trading orders by taking the difference of the 'signal' column (a positive difference indicates a buy order and a negative difference indicates a sell order).

Please replace 'AAPL' with the ticker symbol of the stock you are interested in. Also, make sure to adjust the span parameters in the ewm() function calls to match the periods you want to analyze.
