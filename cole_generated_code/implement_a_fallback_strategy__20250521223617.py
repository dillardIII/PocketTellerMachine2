Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python when no backtest results are found. This example assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that returns the backtest results or `None` if no results are found.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    results = run_backtest()

    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Implement your fallback strategy here
        fallback_results = run_fallback_strategy()
        return fallback_results

    return results

def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    pass

def run_fallback_strategy():
    # Your fallback strategy code here
    pass
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results()` first tries to get the backtest results by calling `run_backtest()`. If no results are found (i.e., `run_backtest()` returns `None`), it prints a message and then runs the fallback strategy by calling `run_fallback_strategy()`. The results of the fallback strategy are then returned.

You would need to replace `run_backtest()` and `run_fallback_strategy()` with your actual backtest and fallback strategy code.
