Sure, here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this example, we assume that the backtest function returns None when no results are found. 

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for the actual backtest function
    # It should return the results if they exist, and None if they don't
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for the fallback strategy
    # It should be implemented according to your needs
    pass

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found. Executing main strategy.")
        # Here you would normally do something with the results
        pass
```

You can replace the `backtest`, `fallback_strategy`, and `execute_strategy` functions with your own implementations. The `execute_strategy` function checks if the backtest results exist, and if not, it executes the fallback strategy.
