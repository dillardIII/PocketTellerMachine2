Sure, here is a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic moving average crossover trading strategy using pandas library. This strategy generates a buy signal when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, and a sell signal when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as pdr

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
df = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickerSymbol, start='2020-01-01', end='2021-12-31')

# Calculate the short-term simple moving average (SMA)
short_rolling = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-term SMA
long_rolling = df['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create signals
df['short_mavg'] = short_rolling
df['long_mavg'] = long_rolling
df['signal'] = 0.0
df['signal'][short_rolling > long_rolling] = 1.0
df['positions'] = df['signal'].diff()

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)

```

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and it's not guaranteed to generate wins. It's highly recommended to use more sophisticated strategies and consider more factors like trading volume, market volatility, etc. Also, it's important to backtest any strategy before using it in live trading.
