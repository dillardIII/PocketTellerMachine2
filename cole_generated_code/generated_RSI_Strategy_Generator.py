Sure, here is a basic implementation of a Relative Strength Index (RSI) strategy using Python and the pandas library. This example assumes you have a pandas DataFrame `df` with 'Close' prices.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def calculate_rsi(data, window):
    delta = data.diff()
    up, down = delta.copy(), delta.copy()
    up[up < 0] = 0
    down[down > 0] = 0

    average_gain = up.rolling(window).mean()
    average_loss = abs(down.rolling(window).mean())

    rs = average_gain / average_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi

def apply_rsi_strategy(data, rsi_period, rsi_upper, rsi_lower):
    data['RSI'] = calculate_rsi(data['Close'], rsi_period)
    data['Buy_Signal'] = np.where((data['RSI'] < rsi_lower), 1, 0)
    data['Sell_Signal'] = np.where((data['RSI'] > rsi_upper), 1, 0)
    return data

# Assuming df is your DataFrame and it has 'Close' prices
rsi_period = 14  # Use 14 periods to calculate RSI
rsi_upper = 70   # Sell when RSI goes above this
rsi_lower = 30   # Buy when RSI goes below this

df_with_signals = apply_rsi_strategy(df, rsi_period, rsi_upper, rsi_lower)
```

This code first calculates the RSI for the given period and then generates buy signals when the RSI goes below a certain level (indicating the asset is oversold) and sell signals when the RSI goes above a certain level (indicating the asset is overbought).
