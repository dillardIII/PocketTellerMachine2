Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that you are using a function called `get_backtest_results()` to get the backtest results and a function called `fallback_strategy()` as your fallback strategy.

```python
def execute_strategy():
    try:
        # Try to get backtest results
        backtest_results = get_backtest_results()
        
        # Check if backtest results are empty
        if not backtest_results:
            print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
            fallback_strategy()
        else:
            print("Backtest results found. Executing main strategy...")
            # Here you can add code to execute your main strategy
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        print("Executing fallback strategy due to error...")
        fallback_strategy()

def get_backtest_results():
    # This function should return your backtest results
    # For now, it returns None to simulate no backtest results found
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement your fallback strategy
    print("Fallback strategy executed.")

# Execute the strategy
execute_strategy()
```

In this code, the `execute_strategy()` function tries to get the backtest results. If no results are found or an error occurs, it executes the fallback strategy. Otherwise, it executes the main strategy. The `get_backtest_results()` function is a placeholder for your actual function to get backtest results, and the `fallback_strategy()` function is a placeholder for your actual fallback strategy.
