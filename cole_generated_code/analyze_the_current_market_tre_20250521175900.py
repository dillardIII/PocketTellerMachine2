To complete your request, we need to have or access database or APIs containing current market trends, which would provide data to analyze. However, I'm going to write a basic Python code to perform analysis of stock data using the Yahoo Finance API. This can then be used to write more detailed analyses.

Please install the yfinance and pandas library using pip if you haven't done so:
```
pip install yfinance pandas
``` 

```
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'PTM'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2020-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# calculate the moving average
tickerDf['MA_10'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(10).mean()

# calculate the percentage change
tickerDf['change'] = tickerDf['Close'].pct_change()

print(tickerDf)
```

In this code, you need to replace 'PTM' with the actual symbol of the stock you are interested in. The code calculates two potential indicators of market opportunities: moving averages and percentage change. You would need to employ more sophisticated business logic to identify "opportunities," such as crossover strategies or other technical indicators.
  
Please note data can't be extracted without access to the databases or APIs containing the market data, this can be unavailable without those. Replace 'PTM' with the ticker of the company you are interested in.  To get the data you have to call respective API/database endpoints to get information. Please make sure that you have relevant access/databse/API information.
