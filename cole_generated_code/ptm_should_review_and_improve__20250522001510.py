As an AI, I can't directly influence PTM's risk management strategies, but I can provide you with a Python code that simulates risk management strategies. This code will simulate different scenarios and calculate potential losses. This could be a starting point for PTM to review and improve its strategies.

This code uses the Monte Carlo simulation method, a widely used technique in risk management.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the variables
initial_investment = 1000000 # initial investment amount
num_simulations = 1000 # number of simulations
num_days = 252 # number of trading days in a year

# Assume a stock portfolio (you can replace it with your actual portfolio)
stock_daily_returns = np.random.normal(0.001, 0.02, num_days) 

# Run the Monte Carlo simulation
simulation_df = pd.DataFrame()

for x in range(num_simulations):
    count = 0
    daily_cumulative_returns = [0]
    
    for j in range(num_days):
        temp = initial_investment + initial_investment * stock_daily_returns[j]
        daily_cumulative_returns.append(temp)
        count += 1
    
    simulation_df[x] = daily_cumulative_returns

# Calculate potential losses for each simulated scenario
final_cumulative_returns = simulation_df.iloc[-1, :]
cumulative_returns_sorted = final_cumulative_returns.sort_values()
VaR_95 = np.percentile(cumulative_returns_sorted, 5)

print("Value at Risk (VaR) for 95% confidence level: ", VaR_95)
```

This code calculates the Value at Risk (VaR) at the 95% confidence level. VaR is a measure of the risk of loss for investments. It estimates how much a set of investments might lose, given normal market conditions, in a set time period such as a day. 

Please note that this is a very simplified version of risk management, and actual risk management strategies involve much more complex models and factors.
