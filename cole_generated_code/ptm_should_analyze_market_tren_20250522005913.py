In order to analyze market trends to identify potential trading opportunities, we can use the pandas library to analyze data, and yfinance library to fetch the stock market data. Here is a simple example of how you can do it:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

# Download historical data as dataframe
yf.pdr_override()
df = pdr.get_data_yahoo("AAPL", start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

# Calculate moving averages
df['MA10'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
df['MA50'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a function to signal when to buy and sell an asset
def buy_sell(signal):
    Buy = []
    Sell = []
    flag = -1

    for i in range(0, len(signal)):
        if signal['MA10'][i] > signal['MA50'][i]:
            Sell.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 1:
                Buy.append(signal['Close'][i])
                flag = 1
            else:
                Buy.append(np.nan)
        elif signal['MA10'][i] < signal['MA50'][i]:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 0:
                Sell.append(signal['Close'][i])
                flag = 0
            else:
                Sell.append(np.nan)
        else:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            Sell.append(np.nan)

    return (Buy, Sell)

# Create buy and sell column
df['Buy_Signal_Price'] = buy_sell(df)[0]
df['Sell_Signal_Price'] = buy_sell(df)[1]

# Print the dataframe
print(df)
```

This script will fetch the historical data of Apple's stock price, calculate the moving averages for the past 10 and 50 days, and generate buy/sell signals based on these moving averages. When the 10-day moving average crosses above the 50-day moving average, it generates a buy signal, and when it crosses below, it generates a sell signal.

Please note that this is a very basic form of market trend analysis, and real trading algorithms use much more complex methods and data. Also, this script requires the yfinance and pandas_datareader libraries, which you can install using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas_datareader
```

Remember, investing in the stock market always comes with risks, and this script should not be used for real trading without proper knowledge and understanding of the stock market.
