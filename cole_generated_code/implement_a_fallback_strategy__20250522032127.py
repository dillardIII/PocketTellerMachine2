Sure, here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that runs a backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, it will run a fallback strategy.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function should run the backtest and return the results
    # For the sake of this example, it will return None
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement the fallback strategy
    print("Running fallback strategy...")

def main():
    backtest_results = run_backtest()

    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")
        # Process the backtest results

main()
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` are placeholders for your actual backtesting and fallback strategy functions. You would need to replace them with your actual functions.
