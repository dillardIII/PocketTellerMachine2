Sure, here is a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the fallback strategy is to return a message saying "No backtest results found. Please try again."

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    # This is a placeholder for your actual backtest results retrieval code
    # It should return a list of backtest results, or an empty list if no results are found
    return []

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Please try again.")

def main():
    backtest_results = get_backtest_results()
    if not backtest_results:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Continue with your normal processing of backtest results
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results()` is a placeholder for your actual function to retrieve backtest results. If this function returns an empty list (indicating no results were found), the `fallback_strategy()` function is called. Otherwise, you would continue with your normal processing of the backtest results.

Please replace the placeholder function with your actual backtest results retrieval code.
