To complete this task, we would need to use a combination of data analysis and machine learning libraries in Python. Here's a simplified example of how you might start to approach this problem using pandas for data manipulation and analysis, yfinance to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance, and sklearn to create a simple predictive model.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and actual trading algorithms can be extremely complex and require a deep understanding of both programming and financial markets.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Download historical data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate technical indicators (e.g., moving averages)
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Drop missing values
data = data.dropna()

# Define features and target
features = data[['SMA_50', 'SMA_200']]
target = data['Close']

# Split data into training and test sets
features_train, features_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(features_train, target_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(features_test)

# Print predictions
print(predictions)
```

This code downloads historical data for Apple's stock (AAPL), calculates two simple moving averages (SMA) as technical indicators, and uses them to predict the closing price. The RandomForestRegressor is a simple machine learning model that can capture non-linear relationships between the features and the target.

Please note that this is a simplified example and actual trading algorithms can be extremely complex and require a deep understanding of both programming and financial markets. Additionally, this code does not take into account transaction costs, slippage, market impact, or other factors that could affect trading performance.
