To develop and implement trading strategies, we need to have a clear understanding of the market data. Here is a simple Python code using pandas library to analyze the market data and implement a simple moving average crossover strategy.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for required stocks
yf.pdr_override()
ticker = "AAPL"
df = pdr.get_data_yahoo(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2021-12-31")

# Calculate moving averages
shortEMA = df.Close.ewm(span=12, adjust=False).mean() # Short term Exponential Moving Average
longEMA = df.Close.ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean() # Long term Exponential Moving Average

# Create trading signals
df['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(shortEMA > longEMA, 1, 0)
df['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(shortEMA < longEMA, -1, 0)

# Calculate daily returns
df['Return'] = df.Close.pct_change()

# Calculate strategy returns
df['Strategy_Return'] = df.Return * df.Buy_Signal.shift()

# Plot strategy returns
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot((df.Strategy_Return+1).cumprod(), label='Strategy Returns')
plt.plot((df.Return+1).cumprod(), label='Buy and Hold Returns')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This code implements a simple moving average crossover strategy. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it generates a buy signal. When the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, it generates a sell signal.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and does not take into account transaction costs, slippage, risk management, etc. It is recommended to use this as a starting point and build more complex strategies based on it.
