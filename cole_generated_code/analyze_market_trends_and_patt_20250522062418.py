Analyzing market trends and patterns to identify potential trading opportunities involves complex data analysis and machine learning techniques. Here is a simple example of how you could use Python to analyze stock data using Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. 

This script will download historical data for a specific stock, calculate its moving average, and plot the data. A moving average is a common indicator used in technical analysis to identify trends.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as web
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = "AAPL"
df = web.DataReader(ticker, 'yahoo', start='01-01-2020', end='12-31-2020')

# Calculate the short-term/simple moving average over a 20 day window
df['SMA_20'] = df['Adj Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-term/simple moving average over a 100 day window
df['SMA_100'] = df['Adj Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Plot closing price, short-term and long-term moving averages 
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(df['Adj Close'], label=ticker)
plt.plot(df['SMA_20'], label='SMA 20 days')
plt.plot(df['SMA_100'], label='SMA 100 days')
plt.title('Adjusted Close Price and Moving Averages of ' + ticker)
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This is a very basic form of analysis. For more advanced analysis, you could use machine learning models to predict future price movements, or use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze news articles or social media posts for sentiment analysis.

Please note that financial trading involves significant risk, and this script should not be used for real trading without further improvements.
