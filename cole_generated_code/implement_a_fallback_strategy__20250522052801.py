Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This is a very basic example, and the fallback strategy simply prints a message and returns an empty dictionary. In a real-world scenario, the fallback strategy could be more complex, such as trying a different backtest method, logging an error for further investigation, or notifying the user.

```python
def run_backtest(strategy):
    # Run backtest with the given strategy
    # This is a placeholder for the actual backtest code
    # In this example, it returns None to simulate no backtest results found
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # Fallback strategy when no backtest results are found
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
    # This is a placeholder for the actual fallback strategy
    # In this example, it returns an empty dictionary
    return {}

def main():
    strategy = "Strategy 1"  # Replace with actual strategy
    backtest_results = run_backtest(strategy)
    if backtest_results is None:
        backtest_results = fallback_strategy()
    return backtest_results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code:

- `run_backtest(strategy)` is a function that runs a backtest with the given strategy. This is a placeholder for the actual backtest code. In this example, it returns `None` to simulate no backtest results found.
- `fallback_strategy()` is a function that implements the fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This is a placeholder for the actual fallback strategy. In this example, it returns an empty dictionary.
- `main()` is the main function that runs the backtest and implements the fallback strategy if no backtest results are found.
- The `if __name__ == "__main__":` line allows or prevents parts of code from being run when the modules are imported.
