Sure, here is a Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def get_backtest_results(backtest_id):
    # Assuming get_results is a function that returns backtest results
    try:
        results = get_results(backtest_id)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error occurred: {str(e)}")
        results = None

    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Applying fallback strategy...")
        # Fallback strategy: return an empty dictionary
        return {}

    return results
```

In this code, we first try to get the backtest results. If an error occurs or the results are None (indicating that no results were found), we apply the fallback strategy. The fallback strategy in this case is to return an empty dictionary, but you could replace this with any strategy you prefer.
