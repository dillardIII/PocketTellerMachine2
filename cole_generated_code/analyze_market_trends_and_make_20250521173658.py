To complete this task, we need to implement a predictive model using machine learning techniques based on historical data. Specifically, this type of task can be classified as a time-series prediction. A commonly used method is the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model.

Here is a simplified example of how this could be done using Python with the pandas and statsmodels libraries. Please note that for real market prediction tasks, the analysis process is much more complex and sometimes even involves financial engineering and machine learning techniques.

Please remember to replace the "market_data.csv" to your own data source. Ensure your data is in the correct format and respects past market trends. This is just a basic script and might not fully saturate the need for complex market trend analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Load and preprocess the data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data.index = data['Date']
data = data['Price']

# Step 2: Fit the ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(data, order=(5,1,0)) # This order is just for example
model_fit = model.fit()

# Step 3: Make prediction
prediction = model_fit.predict(start=len(data), end=len(data) + 1)

# Printing the prediction for tomorrow
print('Prediction for tomorrow:', prediction[-1])

# Step 4: Visualize the original time series and prediction
plt.plot(data)
plt.plot(prediction, color='red')
plt.show()
```
In real-world applications, you'd probably want to experiment with different settings or use more advanced models, and use additional data such as market trends or economic indicators. You'd also need to split the data into a training set and a test set to evaluate the performance of your model.
