Here is a simple Python code to analyze market trends and patterns using pandas and yfinance libraries. This code will download the historical data for a specific stock symbol and calculate its moving averages to identify potential trading opportunities. 

Please note that this is a very basic form of analysis and real-world trading systems use much more complex algorithms and data sets for analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_moving_average(data, window_size):
    return data['Close'].rolling(window=window_size).mean()

def analyze_trends(symbol):
    # Download historical data as dataframe
    data = yf.download(symbol, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

    # Calculate short-term and long-term moving averages
    data['Short_Term_MA'] = calculate_moving_average(data, 20) # 20 days
    data['Long_Term_MA'] = calculate_moving_average(data, 50) # 50 days

    # Identify potential buy signals (when short-term MA crosses above long-term MA)
    buy_signals = (data['Short_Term_MA'] > data['Long_Term_MA']) & (data['Short_Term_MA'].shift(1) < data['Long_Term_MA'].shift(1))

    # Identify potential sell signals (when short-term MA crosses below long-term MA)
    sell_signals = (data['Short_Term_MA'] < data['Long_Term_MA']) & (data['Short_Term_MA'].shift(1) > data['Long_Term_MA'].shift(1))

    # Print potential buy and sell dates
    print('Potential Buy Dates:')
    print(data[buy_signals].index)
    print('\nPotential Sell Dates:')
    print(data[sell_signals].index)

# Test the function
analyze_trends('AAPL')
```

This code will print out the dates where the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average (potential buy signals) and where it crosses below (potential sell signals). This is a common technical analysis strategy known as a moving average crossover.
