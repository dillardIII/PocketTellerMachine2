Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This function, `run_backtest`, takes a trading strategy as input and returns the backtest results. If no results are found, it falls back to a default strategy.

```python
def run_backtest(strategy):
    # Run the backtest with the given strategy
    backtest_results = strategy.run_backtest()

    # If no results are found, fall back to the default strategy
    if not backtest_results:
        print("No backtest results found. Falling back to default strategy.")
        default_strategy = DefaultStrategy()
        backtest_results = default_strategy.run_backtest()

    return backtest_results
```

In this example, `DefaultStrategy` is a placeholder for whatever your default strategy should be. You would replace this with the actual implementation of your default strategy.

Please note that the actual implementation of the backtest and the strategies would depend heavily on the specifics of your trading system. The provided function is a high-level example and might need to be adjusted to fit your specific needs.
