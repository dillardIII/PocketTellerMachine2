Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This is a very basic example, and the fallback strategy simply prints a message and returns an empty dictionary. Depending on your specific requirements, you may want to implement a more complex fallback strategy.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    # This is a placeholder for the function that fetches the backtest results.
    # In a real-world scenario, this function would likely fetch the results from a database or an API.
    return {}

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
    # This is a placeholder for the fallback strategy.
    # Depending on your specific requirements, you may want to implement a more complex fallback strategy.
    return {}

def main():
    backtest_results = get_backtest_results()
    if not backtest_results:
        backtest_results = fallback_strategy()
    return backtest_results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, the `main` function first tries to fetch the backtest results by calling the `get_backtest_results` function. If no results are found (i.e., if `get_backtest_results` returns an empty dictionary), the `main` function calls the `fallback_strategy` function and uses its return value as the backtest results.
