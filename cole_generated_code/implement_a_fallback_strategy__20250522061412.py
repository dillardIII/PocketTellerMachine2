Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that returns the backtest results or `None` if no results are found. The fallback strategy here is to run a different backtest, represented by the function `run_fallback_backtest()`.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    results = run_backtest()

    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback backtest...")
        results = run_fallback_backtest()

        if results is None:
            print("No fallback backtest results found. Please check your trading strategy.")
            return None

    return results

# Run the function
backtest_results = get_backtest_results()
if backtest_results is not None:
    print("Backtest results:")
    print(backtest_results)
```

Please replace `run_backtest()` and `run_fallback_backtest()` with your actual backtest functions. This code will first try to get the backtest results. If no results are found, it will try to run a fallback backtest. If still no results are found, it will print an error message and return `None`.
