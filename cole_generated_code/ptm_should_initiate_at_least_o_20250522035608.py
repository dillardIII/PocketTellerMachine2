To initiate a trade and gather data to assess market conditions, we would need to interact with a trading API. Here is a simple example of how you might do this using the Alpaca API, which allows for commission-free trading and has a Python SDK.

Please note that you need to install the alpaca-trade-api package and replace 'APCA-API-KEY-ID' and 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY' with your own API keys.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API connection
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Initiate a trade
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)

# Gather data to assess market conditions
barset = api.get_barset('AAPL', 'day', limit=5)
aapl_bars = barset['AAPL']

# See how much AAPL moved in the past 5 days.
week_open = aapl_bars[0].o
week_close = aapl_bars[-1].c
percent_change = (week_close - week_open) / week_open * 100
print('AAPL moved {}% over the last 5 days'.format(percent_change))
```

This script will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of AAPL, then gather the last 5 days of price data for AAPL and calculate the percent change over that period. Please note that this is a very basic example and a real trading system would need to be much more complex.
