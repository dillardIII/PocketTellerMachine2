Sure, here is a simple Python code that uses an imaginary trading API to initiate a trade. Please note that this is a hypothetical example and won't work in real-life trading as it requires a real trading API and valid credentials.

```python
import requests

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, api_key, api_secret):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.api_secret = api_secret

    def initiate_trade(self, symbol, qty, side, type, time_in_force):
        url = "https://api.tradingplatform.com/v1/orders"
        headers = {
            "APCA-API-KEY-ID": self.api_key,
            "APCA-API-SECRET-KEY": self.api_secret
        }
        data = {
            "symbol": symbol,
            "qty": qty,
            "side": side,
            "type": type,
            "time_in_force": time_in_force
        }
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
        return response.json()

# Replace with your real API key and secret
ptm = PTM("your_api_key", "your_api_secret")

# Initiate a trade
# This will try to buy 1 share of AAPL with a market order that's good for the day
trade_response = ptm.initiate_trade("AAPL", 1, "buy", "market", "gtc")

print(trade_response)
```

This code initiates a trade to buy 1 share of AAPL with a market order that's good till cancelled (gtc). Please replace `"your_api_key"` and `"your_api_secret"` with your actual API key and secret.

Please note that trading involves risk and it's possible to lose money. Always make sure you understand what you're doing and consider seeking advice from a financial advisor if you're not sure.
