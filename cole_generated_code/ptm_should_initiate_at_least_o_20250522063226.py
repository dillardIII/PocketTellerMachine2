Here is a simple Python code snippet that simulates trading for PTM (Portfolio Trading Model). This code assumes that we have a function `get_potential_trades()` that returns a list of potential trades, and a function `initiate_trade()` that takes a trade as an argument and initiates it.

```python
class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []

    def get_potential_trades(self):
        # This function should return a list of potential trades.
        # For simplicity, let's assume it returns a list of 10 trades.
        return ["Trade1", "Trade2", "Trade3", "Trade4", "Trade5", 
                "Trade6", "Trade7", "Trade8", "Trade9", "Trade10"]

    def initiate_trade(self, trade):
        # This function should initiate the given trade.
        # For now, let's just print a message.
        print(f"Initiated {trade}")
        self.trades.append(trade)

    def increase_chances_of_winning(self):
        potential_trades = self.get_potential_trades()
        if potential_trades:
            # Initiate at least one trade
            self.initiate_trade(potential_trades[0])

# Create a PTM object
ptm = PTM()

# Call the method to increase chances of winning
ptm.increase_chances_of_winning()
```

This code creates a PTM object and calls the `increase_chances_of_winning()` method. This method gets a list of potential trades and initiates at least one of them to increase the chances of winning.
