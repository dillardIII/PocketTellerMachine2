Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this example, I will assume that the backtest function returns None when no results are found.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your actual backtest function
    # It should return the backtest results if they exist, and None otherwise
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is your fallback strategy
    # It could be anything, like buying a safe asset or doing nothing
    print("No backtest results found, executing fallback strategy...")

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Here you would normally do something with the results, like executing the strategy
        print("Backtest results found, executing strategy...")
```

You can replace the `backtest` and `fallback_strategy` functions with your actual implementation. The `execute_strategy` function is what you would use to execute a strategy, it automatically falls back to the fallback strategy when no backtest results are found.
