Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that returns backtest results and a function `fallback_strategy()` that is called when no backtest results are found.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    results = run_backtest()

    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy...")
        results = fallback_strategy()

    return results

def run_backtest():
    # Your code to run backtest goes here
    # This is just a placeholder
    return {}

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your code for the fallback strategy goes here
    # This is just a placeholder
    return {"fallback": True}

# Test the function
print(get_backtest_results())
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results()` function calls `run_backtest()` to get the backtest results. If no results are found (i.e., the results are empty), it prints a message and then calls `fallback_strategy()` to get the fallback results. The fallback results are then returned.

Please replace the `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` functions with your actual code.
