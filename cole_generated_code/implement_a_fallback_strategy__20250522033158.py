Here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This is a very basic example and the fallback strategy simply prints a message. Depending on the specific requirements of your trading system, you might want to implement a more complex fallback strategy.

```python
def backtest(trading_strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for the backtest function
    # In reality, this function would run a backtest of the trading strategy
    # and return the results
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")

def run_backtest(trading_strategy):
    results = backtest(trading_strategy)
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        return results

# Run backtest
run_backtest(my_trading_strategy)
```

In this code, `run_backtest` function is called with a trading strategy as an argument. It runs the backtest and checks if the results are `None`. If the results are `None`, it means that no backtest results were found, and it calls the `fallback_strategy` function. 

Please replace `my_trading_strategy` with your actual trading strategy.
