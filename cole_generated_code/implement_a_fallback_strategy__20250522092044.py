Sure, here is a simple example of how you can implement a fallback strategy in Python when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume we have a function `run_backtest` that runs the backtest and returns a dictionary with the results
    results = run_backtest(strategy)

    # Check if the results dictionary is empty
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Falling back to default strategy.")
        # Implement your fallback strategy here. In this case, we just return an empty dictionary
        return {}
    else:
        return results

def run_backtest(strategy):
    # This is just a placeholder for the actual backtest implementation
    # In the real implementation, this function would run the backtest and return the results
    # For this example, let's assume that no backtest results are found, so we return an empty dictionary
    return {}
```

You would need to replace `run_backtest` with your actual backtest implementation. If the backtest fails or no results are found, it should return an empty dictionary. The `backtest_strategy` function checks if the results are empty, and if they are, it falls back to a default strategy. In this case, the fallback is just to return an empty dictionary, but you could replace this with whatever fallback behavior is appropriate for your application.
