To conduct a thorough market analysis, we need to use a combination of data analysis and machine learning. Here is a simple example using Python, pandas and yfinance to get the stock data, and then calculate the moving average to identify potential trading opportunities.

This code does not include machine learning part, but it's a start for basic market analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define the ticker list
tickers_list = ['AAPL', 'WMT', 'IBM', 'MU', 'BA', 'AXP']

# Fetch the data
def get_data(tickers):
    stock_data = {}
    for ticker in tickers:
        ticker_data = yf.download(ticker, start=(datetime.now() - timedelta(days=365)), end=datetime.now())
        stock_data[ticker] = ticker_data
    return stock_data

# Calculate and add moving average to data
def add_moving_average(stock_data, window):
    for ticker in stock_data:
        stock_data[ticker]['Moving Average'] = stock_data[ticker]['Close'].rolling(window=window).mean()
    return stock_data

# Identify potential trading opportunities
def identify_opportunities(stock_data):
    opportunities = []
    for ticker in stock_data:
        # A simple strategy: if the close price of the last day is greater than the moving average, it might be a good opportunity
        if stock_data[ticker].iloc[-1]['Close'] > stock_data[ticker].iloc[-1]['Moving Average']:
            opportunities.append(ticker)
    return opportunities

stock_data = get_data(tickers_list)
stock_data = add_moving_average(stock_data, window=50)
opportunities = identify_opportunities(stock_data)

print("Potential trading opportunities: ", opportunities)
```

This is a very simple example and the strategy used here is very basic. In real-world scenarios, more complex strategies and machine learning models would be used to analyze the market and identify potential trading opportunities.
