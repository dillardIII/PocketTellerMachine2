Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This function assumes that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that runs the backtest and returns the results. If `run_backtest()` returns `None`, indicating that no backtest results were found, the function will execute the fallback strategy.

```python
def run_backtest_with_fallback():
    # Run the backtest
    results = run_backtest()

    # Check if the backtest returned results
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")

        # Implement your fallback strategy here
        # For example, you might want to rerun the backtest with different parameters
        # Or you might want to alert the user or log the issue
        # This is a simple example where we just rerun the backtest
        results = run_backtest()

        # If still no results, raise an exception
        if results is None:
            raise Exception("No backtest results found even after implementing fallback strategy.")

    return results
```

This is a simple example and your actual fallback strategy might be more complex. For example, you might want to try running the backtest with different parameters, or you might want to alert the user or log the issue if no backtest results are found.
