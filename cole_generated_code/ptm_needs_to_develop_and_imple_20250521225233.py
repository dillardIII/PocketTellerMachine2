To develop and implement trading strategies, we need to consider several factors such as historical data, technical indicators, and market trends. Here is a simple Python code using pandas and yfinance libraries to fetch historical data and calculate the moving average, which is a common technical indicator used in trading strategies.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading strategies can be very complex and involve many other factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_moving_average(symbol, start_date, end_date, window_size):
    # Fetch historical market data
    df = yf.download(symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)

    # Calculate moving average
    df['Moving_Avg'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=window_size).mean()

    return df

# Test the function
df = calculate_moving_average('AAPL', '2020-01-01', '2021-12-31', 20)
print(df)
```

This code fetches the historical market data for a specific stock symbol (in this case, 'AAPL' for Apple Inc.) between the specified start and end dates. It then calculates the moving average of the closing prices over a specified window size (in this case, 20 days). The moving average is a common technical indicator used in trading strategies.

Please note that this is a simple example and does not constitute a trading strategy by itself. A real trading strategy would consider many other factors and would likely involve complex algorithms and machine learning techniques.
