It seems like you're asking for a Python code that simulates trading activities for PTM (which I assume is a trading bot or a trading entity). Here's a simple Python code that simulates buying and selling stocks using random values. 

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # initial balance
        self.stocks = 0  # initial stocks

    def buy(self, price):
        if self.balance > price:
            self.stocks += 1
            self.balance -= price
            print(f"PTM bought a stock for {price}. Current balance: {self.balance}")

    def sell(self, price):
        if self.stocks > 0:
            self.stocks -= 1
            self.balance += price
            print(f"PTM sold a stock for {price}. Current balance: {self.balance}")

    def trade(self):
        for _ in range(100):  # simulate 100 trading actions
            price = random.uniform(50, 200)  # random price between 50 and 200
            action = random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])  # random action

            if action == 'buy':
                self.buy(price)
            else:
                self.sell(price)

ptm = PTM()
ptm.trade()
```

This code creates a PTM object with an initial balance and stocks. It then simulates 100 trading actions where PTM randomly decides to buy or sell a stock at a random price. Please note that this is a very simplified version of trading and doesn't take into account many factors that would be considered in real trading.
