To analyze market trends and adjust trading approach accordingly, we would need to use machine learning techniques. Here is a simplified example of how you could implement this using Python. In this example, we'll use a simple moving average strategy and adjust the trading approach based on the trend.

Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, LSTM

def analyze_market_trends(data):
    # Calculate moving averages
    data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
    data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

    # Determine the market trend
    data['Trend'] = 'None'
    data.loc[data['SMA_50'] > data['SMA_200'], 'Trend'] = 'Bull'
    data.loc[data['SMA_50'] < data['SMA_200'], 'Trend'] = 'Bear'

    return data

def adjust_trading_approach(data):
    # If the market is in a bull trend, buy when the price is above the 50-day moving average
    # If the market is in a bear trend, sell when the price is below the 50-day moving average
    data['Action'] = 'Hold'
    data.loc[(data['Trend'] == 'Bull') & (data['Close'] > data['SMA_50']), 'Action'] = 'Buy'
    data.loc[(data['Trend'] == 'Bear') & (data['Close'] < data['SMA_50']), 'Action'] = 'Sell'

    return data

# Load market data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Analyze market trends
data = analyze_market_trends(data)

# Adjust trading approach based on market trends
data = adjust_trading_approach(data)

print(data)
```

This script loads market data from a CSV file, calculates 50-day and 200-day moving averages, determines the market trend based on these averages, and then decides whether to buy or sell based on the trend and the current price.

Please note that this is a very rudimentary trading strategy and is for illustrative purposes only. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider many more factors and use more sophisticated algorithms.
