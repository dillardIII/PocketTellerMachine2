Here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. In this example, I'll assume that we have a function called `get_backtest_results()` that returns the backtest results. If no results are found, it returns `None`. The fallback strategy here is to return a message saying no results were found and possibly take any other necessary action.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    # This function should return the backtest results.
    # If no results are found, it should return None.
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement the fallback strategy.
    # It could be anything from sending an alert, logging the issue, 
    # trying to get the results again after some time, etc.
    print("No backtest results were found. Implementing fallback strategy.")

def main():
    results = get_backtest_results()
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Process the results
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please replace the `pass` in the `get_backtest_results()` and `fallback_strategy()` functions with the actual code. The `get_backtest_results()` function should return the backtest results, and the `fallback_strategy()` function should implement the fallback strategy.
