Sure, first we need to define what our fallback strategy is. For this example, I'll assume that our fallback strategy is to simply return a message stating that no backtest results were found and suggest to run the backtest again. Here's a simple implementation:

```python
def run_backtest(strategy):
    # Assuming `backtest` is a function that runs the backtest and returns results
    results = backtest(strategy)
    
    if not results:
        return {
            'status': 'error',
            'message': 'No backtest results found. Please run the backtest again.'
        }
    
    return {
        'status': 'success',
        'results': results
    }

# Run backtest
strategy = 'my_strategy'
print(run_backtest(strategy))
```

In this code, `run_backtest` function runs the backtest for a given strategy. If the `backtest` function returns `None` or an empty list/dictionary (or any other data type that evaluates to `False`), it means that no backtest results were found and the fallback strategy is activated.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation. Depending on your actual backtest function and what you want to do as a fallback, you might need to adjust the code.
