Sure, here's a simple example of how you might initiate a trade using a hypothetical trading API. This example uses the requests library to send a POST request to the API, which initiates a trade. Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world trading involves much more complexity.

```python
import requests
import json

# Define the API endpoint
url = "http://example.com/api/trade"

# Define the headers for the API request
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
}

# Define the data for the trade
data = {
    "symbol": "AAPL",  # The symbol for the stock
    "quantity": 1,  # The number of shares to buy
    "action": "buy"  # The action (buy or sell)
}

# Send the POST request to the API
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))

# Print the response from the API
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Trade initiated successfully.")
else:
    print(f"Failed to initiate trade. Status code: {response.status_code}. Message: {response.text}")
```

Please replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key. Also, make sure that the API endpoint and the data required by your API match with the example.

This script will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The response from the server is then checked - if the status code is 200, that means the request was successful. If not, the status code and error message are printed out.
