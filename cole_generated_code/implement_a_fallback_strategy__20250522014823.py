Sure, here's a simple way to implement a fallback strategy using Python. This code assumes that you have a function named `run_backtest()` that returns the backtest results or `None` if no results are found. The fallback strategy here is to simply print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Implement your fallback strategy here
        results = {}
    return results
```

In this code, if `run_backtest()` returns `None`, the function will print a message and return an empty dictionary. You can replace the print statement and the empty dictionary with your actual fallback strategy.

Please note that this is a very basic example. Depending on your specific needs and the complexity of your trading system, you might need a more sophisticated fallback strategy.
