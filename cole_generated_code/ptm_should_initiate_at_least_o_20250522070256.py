Sure, here is a simple Python code using the Alpaca API to initiate a trade. Please note that you need to replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your actual Alpaca account's API key and secret key.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up Alpaca API environment
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)

# Get the last 100 of our closed orders
closed_orders = api.list_orders(
    status='closed',
    limit=100,
    nested=True  # show nested multi-leg orders
)

# Print the closed orders
for order in closed_orders:
    print(order)
```

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock at market price. After the trade, it will fetch the last 100 closed orders and print them out. This should give you some data to assess the market's condition. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms can be much more complex. Also, remember to handle exceptions and errors properly in your actual code.
