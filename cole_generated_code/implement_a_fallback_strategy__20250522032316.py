Sure, I'll write a Python function that simulates a backtest and implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. 

```python
def backtest_strategy(data):
    # Simulate a backtest
    backtest_results = None
    try:
        # This is where you would normally perform your backtest
        # For the sake of this example, let's assume it fails and returns None
        backtest_results = None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Backtest failed with error: {e}")

    # Fallback strategy
    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Implement your fallback strategy here
        fallback_results = "Fallback strategy results"
        return fallback_results

    return backtest_results

# Test the function with some dummy data
data = "Dummy data"
print(backtest_strategy(data))
```

In this code, we first try to perform a backtest. If the backtest fails or returns `None` (indicating that no results were found), we implement a fallback strategy. The specifics of the backtest and the fallback strategy are not provided, so I've left comments where you would add that code.
