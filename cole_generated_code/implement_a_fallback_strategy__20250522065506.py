Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy using Python. This example assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that returns backtest results, and a function `run_fallback()` that implements your fallback strategy.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    try:
        # Attempt to get backtest results
        results = run_backtest()
        
        # If no results are found, raise an exception
        if not results:
            raise Exception('No backtest results found')
            
    except Exception as e:
        print(str(e))
        
        # Run the fallback strategy
        print('Running fallback strategy...')
        results = run_fallback()
        
    finally:
        # Return the results, whether from the initial backtest or the fallback
        return results
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` and `run_fallback()` are placeholders for your actual backtest and fallback functions. You would replace these with the actual functions or methods you're using to perform these tasks.

If `run_backtest()` doesn't find any results, it raises an exception. This exception is caught, and the fallback strategy is run instead. The results of either the backtest or the fallback strategy are then returned.
