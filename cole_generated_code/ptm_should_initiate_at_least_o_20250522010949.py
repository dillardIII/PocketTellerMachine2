Sure, here is a simple Python script that uses the Alpaca API to initiate a trade. Please replace the placeholders with your actual API keys and desired stock symbol.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API connection
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Define the symbol and quantity
symbol = '<SYMBOL>' 
qty = 1

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of the stock
order = api.submit_order(
    symbol=symbol,
    qty=qty,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)

print(f"Submitted order to buy {qty} share(s) of {symbol}")
```

This script will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of the specified stock. The trade data can then be gathered from the Alpaca API for analysis and improvement. Please note that this is a basic example and does not include any error checking or handling. You should add appropriate error checking and handling for a production environment.

Also, this script uses Alpaca's paper trading API (`https://paper-api.alpaca.markets`), which is a simulated trading environment. You should replace this with the live trading API endpoint (`https://api.alpaca.markets`) when you are ready to execute real trades.
