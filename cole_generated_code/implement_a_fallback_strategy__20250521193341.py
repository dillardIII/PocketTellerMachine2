Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs your backtest and returns the results, or `None` if no results are found. The fallback strategy here is simply to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def run_backtest_with_fallback():
    # Run the backtest
    results = run_backtest()

    # If no results were found, implement the fallback strategy
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Fallback strategy: return an empty dictionary
        results = {}

    return results
```

This is a very basic fallback strategy. Depending on your specific requirements, you might want to do something more complex, like re-running the backtest with different parameters, or raising an exception to halt the program.
