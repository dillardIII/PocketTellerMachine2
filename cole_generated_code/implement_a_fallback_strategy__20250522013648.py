Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python:

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume this function performs backtesting and returns results
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is your fallback strategy
    print("No backtest results found, executing fallback strategy...")

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest_strategy(strategy)
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Continue with your normal flow
        print("Backtest results found, executing main strategy...")

# Call the function with your strategy
execute_strategy(my_strategy)
```

In this code, `backtest_strategy(strategy)` is a placeholder for your actual backtesting function, and `fallback_strategy()` is a placeholder for your fallback strategy. You would replace these with your actual functions.

The `execute_strategy(strategy)` function tries to backtest a given strategy. If no results are found (i.e., `backtest_strategy(strategy)` returns `None`), it executes the fallback strategy. Otherwise, it continues with the normal flow.

Please replace the placeholder functions and the print statements with your actual code.
