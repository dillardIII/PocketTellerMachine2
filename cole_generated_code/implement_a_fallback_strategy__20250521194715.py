Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume `run_backtest` is a function that runs a backtest for a given strategy
    # and returns a dictionary with the results.
    results = run_backtest(strategy)

    # Check if the results are empty
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Falling back to default strategy.")
        # Fallback strategy: return an empty dictionary
        return {}

    return results

# Test the function with a strategy
strategy = "Buy and Hold"
print(backtest_strategy(strategy))
```

Please replace `run_backtest` with the actual function you're using to run the backtest. If the fallback strategy should be different, you can replace the print statement and the return statement with the appropriate code.
