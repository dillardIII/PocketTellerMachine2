Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this example, I'll assume that the backtest results are stored in a list and the fallback strategy is simply to print a message and return an empty list.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    # This is just a placeholder. In real code, this function would fetch backtest results.
    return []

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy.")
    # This is a simple fallback strategy. In real code, this could be anything.
    return []

def main():
    backtest_results = get_backtest_results()
    if not backtest_results:
        backtest_results = fallback_strategy()
    return backtest_results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, the `get_backtest_results` function is supposed to fetch the backtest results. If it returns an empty list (which means no results were found), the `fallback_strategy` function is called.

Please replace the placeholder functions with your actual code.
