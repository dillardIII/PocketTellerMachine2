Sure, I can help you get started with a simple Python code for a trading strategy. Here we will use a simple moving average crossover strategy. It's a very basic strategy where we buy when the short term moving average crosses above the long term moving average and sell when the short term moving average crosses below the long term moving average.

Please note that this is a simplified example and real trading strategies should consider more factors and use more sophisticated algorithms.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas_datareader import data as web

# Define the stock to be traded
stock = 'AAPL'

# Define the period for the short and long moving averages
short_period = 20
long_period = 50

# Load the data
df = web.DataReader(stock, data_source='yahoo', start='01-01-2010')

# Calculate the short and long moving averages
df['Short_MA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=short_period).mean()
df['Long_MA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=long_period).mean()

# Create signals
df['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(df['Short_MA'] > df['Long_MA'], 1, 0)
df['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(df['Short_MA'] < df['Long_MA'], -1, 0)

# Combine signals
df['Signal'] = df['Buy_Signal'] + df['Sell_Signal']

# Plot the stock close price, short moving average and long moving average
plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
plt.title('Moving Average Crossover Strategy')
plt.plot(df['Close'], label='Close Price', color='blue')
plt.plot(df['Short_MA'], label='Short Moving Average', color='red')
plt.plot(df['Long_MA'], label='Long Moving Average', color='green')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```

This script will plot the close price of the stock along with the short and long moving averages. When the red line (short MA) crosses above the green line (long MA), it's a buy signal. When the red line crosses below the green line, it's a sell signal.

Please note that you need to install pandas_datareader library to fetch the stock data. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install pandas_datareader
```

Also, this is a very basic strategy and may not be profitable in real trading. You should backtest it with historical data and adjust it according to the specific conditions of the market and the stock.
