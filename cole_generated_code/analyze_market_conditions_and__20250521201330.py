As an AI, I can't analyze real-time market conditions. However, I can provide you with a Python code that simulates the process of analyzing market conditions and adjusting trading parameters. 

In a real-life scenario, you would need to use APIs provided by your trading platform to get market data, and machine learning algorithms to analyze that data and adjust trading parameters.

Here's a simple example of how you might adjust trading parameters based on market volatility:

```python
import numpy as np

class TradingParameters:
    def __init__(self):
        self.spread = 0.01
        self.lot_size = 1

class MarketConditions:
    def __init__(self):
        self.volatility = np.random.random()  # Randomly generated volatility

class TradingAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.market_conditions = MarketConditions()
        self.trading_parameters = TradingParameters()

    def adjust_parameters(self):
        # If market volatility is high, decrease lot size and increase spread
        if self.market_conditions.volatility > 0.7:
            self.trading_parameters.lot_size *= 0.9
            self.trading_parameters.spread *= 1.1
        # If market volatility is low, increase lot size and decrease spread
        elif self.market_conditions.volatility < 0.3:
            self.trading_parameters.lot_size *= 1.1
            self.trading_parameters.spread *= 0.9

        # Ensure lot size and spread are within reasonable bounds
        self.trading_parameters.lot_size = min(max(self.trading_parameters.lot_size, 0.1), 10)
        self.trading_parameters.spread = min(max(self.trading_parameters.spread, 0.01), 0.1)

        print(f"Adjusted trading parameters: lot size = {self.trading_parameters.lot_size}, spread = {self.trading_parameters.spread}")

assistant = TradingAssistant()
assistant.adjust_parameters()
```

This is a very simplified example. In a real trading system, you would need to consider many more factors and the logic could be much more complex.
