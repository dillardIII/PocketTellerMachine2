To complete the task you requested, we would ideally need current market data supplied by some sort of API. As a language, Python would be perfect to handle this kind of task, given its slew of financial libraries. However, since I can't interact with an API in real time, I'll demonstrate a tenative python code using pandas, pandas_datareader and other libraries. This script will fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance, calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA) and report if the latest close price is above the SMA, indicating a potential buying opportunity.

NOTE: This is a very basic trading strategy for demonstration purposes only. Actual trading strategies consider many other factors, and developing them requires deep understanding of financial markets & careful risk management.

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# Define the ticker list
tickers_list = ['AAPL', 'WMT', 'IBM', 'MU', 'BA', 'AXP']

# Fetch the data
def download_data(ticker):
    data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(ticker, start="2021-01-01", end="2022-12-31")
    return data

# Calculate and Report Opportunities
def analyze_data(tickers):
    for ticker in tickers:
        data = download_data(ticker)
        data['SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=14).mean()

        print(f"Checking data for {ticker}.")
        if data.iloc[-1]['Close'] > data.iloc[-1]['SMA']:
            print(f"{ticker} shows a buying opportunity.\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    analyze_data(tickers_list)
```
This code checks if the closing price for each stock is above the 14-day simple moving average (SMA). If it is, it's often considered a bullish signal, and we print a recommendation to consider buying the stock. This is a very simple strategy and should not be used for real trading without further refinement and analysis.
