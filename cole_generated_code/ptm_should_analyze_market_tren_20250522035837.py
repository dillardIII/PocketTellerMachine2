To analyze market trends and opportunities, we can use Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download stock price data, and matplotlib for visualization. Here is a simple example of how you can analyze a single stock. This is a very basic form of analysis and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters
register_matplotlib_converters()

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL','2016-01-01','2021-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA10'] = data['Close'].rolling(10).mean()
data['MA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(50).mean()

# Create a function to signal when to buy and sell an asset
def buy_sell(signal):
    Buy = []
    Sell = []
    flag = -1

    for i in range(0,len(signal)):
        if signal['MA10'][i] > signal['MA50'][i]:
            Sell.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 1:
                Buy.append(signal['Close'][i])
                flag = 1
            else:
                Buy.append(np.nan)
        elif signal['MA10'][i] < signal['MA50'][i]:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 0:
                Sell.append(signal['Close'][i])
                flag = 0
            else:
                Sell.append(np.nan)
        else:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            Sell.append(np.nan)
            
    return (Buy, Sell)

# Create buy and sell column
data['Buy_Signal_Price'] = buy_sell(data)[0]
data['Sell_Signal_Price'] = buy_sell(data)[1]

# Visually show the stock buy and sell signals
plt.figure(figsize=(12.2, 4.5))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price', alpha=0.35)
plt.plot(data['MA10'], label='MA10', alpha=0.35)
plt.plot(data['MA50'], label='MA50', alpha=0.35)
plt.scatter(data.index, data['Buy_Signal_Price'], color='green', label='Buy Signal', marker='^', alpha=1)
plt.scatter(data.index, data['Sell_Signal_Price'], color='red', label='Sell Signal', marker='v', alpha=1)
plt.title('Apple Close Price History with Buy & Sell Signals')
plt.xlabel('Jan. 01, 2016 - Dec. 31, 2021')
plt.ylabel('Close Price USD ($)')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```

This script uses a simple moving average crossover strategy to determine when to buy and sell. When the 10-day moving average crosses above the 50-day moving average, it's a signal to buy. When the 10-day moving average crosses below the 50-day moving average, it's a signal to sell. 

Please note that this is a very simplistic strategy and should not be used for actual trading without further enhancements.
