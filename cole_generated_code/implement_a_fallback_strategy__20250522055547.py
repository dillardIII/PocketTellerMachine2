Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This is a very basic example and the fallback strategy simply prints a message and returns an empty dictionary. In a real-world scenario, the fallback strategy could be more complex.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume we have a function `run_backtest` that runs the backtest
    # and returns a dictionary with the results or None if no results were found
    results = run_backtest(strategy)

    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results were found. Falling back to default strategy.")
        # Implement your fallback strategy here
        # For simplicity, we just return an empty dictionary
        fallback_results = {}
        return fallback_results

    return results
```

In this code, `run_backtest(strategy)` is a hypothetical function that performs the backtest and returns the results. If this function returns `None`, it means that no backtest results were found and the fallback strategy is executed.
