Analyzing market trends and patterns is a complex task that involves machine learning and data analysis. Here's a simplified example of how you might approach it using Python. In this example, we'll use the pandas library to analyze stock data and the matplotlib library to visualize it.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf

yf.pdr_override()

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'  # Apple Inc.

# Collect data on this ticker
tickerData = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickerSymbol, start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
tickerData['MA10'] = tickerData['Close'].rolling(10).mean()
tickerData['MA50'] = tickerData['Close'].rolling(50).mean()

# Plot closing price and moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.grid(True)
plt.plot(tickerData['Close'], label='Close')
plt.plot(tickerData['MA10'], label='MA10')
plt.plot(tickerData['MA50'], label='MA50')
plt.legend(loc=2)
plt.show()

# Identify potential trading opportunities
buy_signals = tickerData[tickerData['MA10'] > tickerData['MA50']]
sell_signals = tickerData[tickerData['MA10'] < tickerData['MA50']]

print("Potential Buy Signals:")
print(buy_signals)

print("Potential Sell Signals:")
print(sell_signals)
```

In this example, we're using a simple moving average crossover strategy to identify potential trading opportunities. When the 10-day moving average crosses above the 50-day moving average, it's a potential buy signal. When the 10-day moving average crosses below the 50-day moving average, it's a potential sell signal.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and it's not guaranteed to be profitable. Always do your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making trading decisions.
