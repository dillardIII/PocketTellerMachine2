Here's a simple Python code that uses the Alpaca API to initiate a trade. Alpaca provides commission-free stock trading API for individual investors and developers. Please replace 'APCA-API-KEY-ID' and 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY' with your actual Alpaca API keys.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Setup
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Get account info
account = api.get_account()
print(account)

# Check if the market is open now.
clock = api.get_clock()
print('The market is {}'.format('open.' if clock.is_open else 'closed.'))

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock at the current market price. The order is a 'good till cancelled' order, which means it will stay active until it is filled or manually cancelled.

Please note that this is a simplified example and real trading involves careful consideration of many factors like market conditions, risk management etc. Also, make sure to handle any exceptions that might occur while trading.
