Here is a simple example of how you might initiate a trade using Python. This example uses the `yfinance` library to fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance, and the `backtrader` library to initiate and manage the trade. 

Please note that this is a simulation and does not involve real money. Also, this is a very basic example and does not include many important aspects of trading, such as risk management.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import backtrader as bt

# Fetch data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2020-12-31')

# Create a subclass of bt.Strategy to define the indicators and logic
class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    def __init__(self):
        self.sma = bt.indicators.SimpleMovingAverage(self.data.close, period=15)

    def next(self):
        if self.sma > self.data.close:
            # If not in the market, we will buy
            if not self.position:
                self.buy()
        elif self.sma < self.data.close:
            # If in the market, we will sell
            if self.position:
                self.sell()

# Create a backtest
cerebro = bt.Cerebro()
cerebro.addstrategy(MyStrategy)
data = bt.feeds.PandasData(dataname=data)
cerebro.adddata(data)
cerebro.run()

# Print the final portfolio value
print('Final Portfolio Value: %.2f' % cerebro.broker.getvalue())
```

This script will initiate a trade whenever the closing price is below the 15-day simple moving average, and sell whenever the closing price is above the 15-day simple moving average. The final portfolio value is printed at the end.
