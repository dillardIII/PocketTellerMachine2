Without a clear understanding of your existing code, I am providing you a general idea/structure of how a fallback can be implemented when no backtest results are found. In this case, the null result is going to be handled by returning an alternative value or running a separate piece of logic.


```python
def backtest_results():
    # hypothetical backtest function
    # return null if no results are found
    #return backtestResults  

def fallback_strategy():
    print("Fallback strategy is now processing...")

def main():
    results = backtest_results()
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results: ", results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, a hypothetical `backtest_results()` function supposedly returns the backtest results, but if no results are found, it returns `None`. The `main()` function checks if the results are `None`, and if so, it calls the `fallback_strategy()` function. This is a simple way to handle missing results and could be adapted to suit your specific situation.

Please replace the backtest_results function with your actual backtesting function and implement the fallback_strategy function to suit your needs.
