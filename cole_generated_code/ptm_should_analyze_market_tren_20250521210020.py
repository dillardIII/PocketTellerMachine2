To analyze market trends and data, we'll need to use libraries like pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for data visualization, and yfinance to download stock price data. Here is a simple example of how you can do this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters

register_matplotlib_converters()

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-1-25')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Plot the close price of the AAPL
tickerDf['Close'].plot(figsize=(10, 7))
plt.title("Close Price of AAPL", fontsize=16)
plt.ylabel('Price', fontsize=14)
plt.xlabel('Year', fontsize=14)
plt.grid(which="major", color='k', linestyle='-.', linewidth=0.5)
plt.show()
```

This code will download the historical price data of Apple Inc. from 2010 to 2020 and plot the closing price. However, identifying potential trading opportunities requires more sophisticated analysis, including technical indicators, machine learning models, etc. 

Please note that trading involves risks and the code provided here is a very basic example and does not constitute trading advice.
