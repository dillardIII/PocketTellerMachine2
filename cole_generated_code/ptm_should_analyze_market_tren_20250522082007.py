To analyze market trends and adjust trading approach, we can use Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computations, matplotlib for data visualization, and sklearn for machine learning. Here's a simple example of how you might start building a predictive trading model.

Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading models can be extremely complex and require careful consideration of many factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load market data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Assume 'Close' is the target variable we want to predict
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data.Date,format='%Y-%m-%d')
data.index = data['Date']

# Plotting the target variable
plt.figure(figsize=(16,8))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price history')

# Create features and target
features = data.drop(['Date', 'Close'], axis=1)
target = data['Close']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
features_train, features_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(features_train, target_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(features_test)

# You can now use these predictions to adjust your trading approach
```

This code assumes that you have a CSV file named 'market_data.csv' which contains historical market data. The 'Close' column is the closing price of the stock, which we are trying to predict. The other columns are features that you believe may be predictive of the closing price.

Please note that this is a simple linear regression model, which may not be the best model for this task. There are many other models and techniques you could use to predict stock prices, including ARIMA, LSTM, and others. You would also likely want to use more sophisticated techniques to create your features, such as using technical indicators.
