Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assuming backtest() is a function that returns backtest results
    results = backtest(strategy)

    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found for the strategy.")
        print("Implementing fallback strategy...")

        # Assuming fallback_strategy() is a function that implements a fallback strategy
        fallback_results = fallback_strategy()

        if not fallback_results:
            print("No results found for the fallback strategy.")
        else:
            print("Results for the fallback strategy:")
            print(fallback_results)
    else:
        print("Results for the strategy:")
        print(results)

# Assuming strategy is a predefined strategy
strategy = ...
backtest_strategy(strategy)
```

This code assumes that `backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` are functions that return the results of backtesting a given strategy and implementing a fallback strategy respectively. If no results are found for the original strategy, it implements a fallback strategy and prints its results. If no results are found for the fallback strategy, it prints a message indicating this.
