Sure, here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. This example assumes that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that returns the backtest results or `None` if no results are found.

```python
def fallback_strategy():
    # This is your fallback strategy
    print("Running fallback strategy...")

def main():
    # Run backtest
    backtest_results = run_backtest()

    # Check if backtest results are found
    if backtest_results is None:
        # If no backtest results are found, run the fallback strategy
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # If backtest results are found, proceed with the normal workflow
        print("Backtest results found. Proceeding with normal workflow...")

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please replace `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` with your actual functions. The `fallback_strategy()` function should contain the logic that you want to execute when no backtest results are found.
