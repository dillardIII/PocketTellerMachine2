To initiate a trade and gain insights on market trends, we would need to interact with a trading API. Here's an example of how you might do this using the Alpaca API, which is a popular choice for algorithmic trading. 

Before you proceed, make sure you have installed the Alpaca API by using pip install alpaca-trade-api.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Replace these with your API connection info from the dashboard
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Get daily price data for AAPL over the last 5 trading days.
barset = api.get_barset('AAPL', 'day', limit=5)
aapl_bars = barset['AAPL']

# See how much AAPL moved in that timeframe.
week_open = aapl_bars[0].o
week_close = aapl_bars[-1].c
percent_change = (week_close - week_open) / week_open * 100
print('AAPL moved {}% over the last 5 days'.format(percent_change))

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This script connects to the Alpaca API, fetches the last 5 days of price data for AAPL, calculates the percentage change over that period, and initiates a market order to buy 1 share of AAPL.

Please replace '<APCA-API-KEY-ID>' and '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>' with your own API keys. 

Remember, this is a simplified example. In a real-world application, you would want to add error handling, possibly make the trading logic more complex, and definitely not hard-code your API keys.
