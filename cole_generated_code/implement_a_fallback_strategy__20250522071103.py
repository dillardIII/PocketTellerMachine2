Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet to implement a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    try:
        # Run backtest
        results = strategy.backtest()
        
        # Check if results are empty
        if not results:
            raise ValueError("No backtest results found.")
            
        return results

    except ValueError as ve:
        print(ve)
        print("Running fallback strategy...")
        
        # Fallback strategy
        fallback_results = strategy.fallback()
        
        return fallback_results

    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred: ", e)
        return None
```

In this code, we first try to backtest the strategy. If no results are found (i.e., the results are empty), we raise a ValueError and then catch it immediately. In the except block for ValueError, we print an error message and then run the fallback strategy. If any other exception occurs, we catch it in the final except block, print an error message, and return None. 

Please note that this is a very basic implementation. The actual implementation might be more complex depending on the details of the `strategy.backtest()` and `strategy.fallback()` methods, and how you want to handle different types of exceptions.
