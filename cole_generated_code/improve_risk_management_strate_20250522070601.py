In order to improve risk management strategies, we can use Python to create a simple risk management tool. This tool will calculate the position size for a trade based on the stop loss level and the amount of capital we are willing to risk.

Here is a simple Python function that calculates the position size:

```python
def calculate_position_size(account_balance, risk_per_trade, entry_price, stop_loss_price):
    """
    Calculate the position size based on the account balance, risk per trade, entry price and stop loss price.

    Parameters:
    account_balance (float): The total account balance.
    risk_per_trade (float): The risk per trade as a percentage of the account balance.
    entry_price (float): The entry price for the trade.
    stop_loss_price (float): The stop loss price for the trade.

    Returns:
    float: The position size.
    """

    # Calculate the risk amount in dollars
    risk_amount = account_balance * (risk_per_trade / 100)

    # Calculate the risk in price
    risk_in_price = abs(entry_price - stop_loss_price)

    # Calculate the position size
    position_size = risk_amount / risk_in_price

    return position_size
```

This function calculates the position size based on the account balance, the risk per trade (as a percentage of the account balance), the entry price and the stop loss price. The position size is the amount of capital we should put into a trade to ensure that we do not risk more than the specified risk per trade.

This is a simple risk management strategy and should be part of a larger risk management plan. It does not take into account other factors such as market volatility, liquidity, or other market conditions that could affect the outcome of a trade.
