Here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. The fallback strategy could be different depending on the context, but in this case, I'll assume that we want to return a message indicating that no backtest results were found and perhaps run a default backtest as a fallback.

```python
def run_backtest(strategy):
    # Assuming `get_backtest_results` is a function that gets the backtest results
    # for a given strategy
    results = get_backtest_results(strategy)
    
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found for the strategy.")
        print("Running default backtest as a fallback...")
        
        # Assuming `run_default_backtest` is a function that runs a default backtest
        default_results = run_default_backtest()
        
        return default_results
    
    return results
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results(strategy)` and `run_default_backtest()` are placeholder functions. You would replace them with actual functions that get the backtest results for a given strategy and run a default backtest, respectively.
