Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the program will print a message and return a default value.

```python
def get_backtest_results(backtest_id):
    # This is a placeholder for the actual code that would retrieve backtest results
    # based on the backtest_id.
    backtest_results = None  # Assume we couldn't find the results

    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Implement your fallback strategy here. For this example, we'll just return a default value.
        return {"success": False, "message": "No backtest results found."}
    else:
        return backtest_results
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results` is a function that is supposed to retrieve backtest results based on a `backtest_id`. If it can't find any results, it falls back to returning a dictionary with a "success" key set to `False` and a "message" key set to "No backtest results found.".

You would replace the `backtest_results = None` line with the actual code that retrieves the backtest results. The fallback strategy could also be more complex, such as trying to retrieve the results again after waiting for a certain period of time, or trying to retrieve results from a different source.
