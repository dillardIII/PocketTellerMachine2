It seems like you're asking for a Python code to simulate a trade for PTM. However, please note that actual trading involves real money and should be done through secure, authorized platforms. Python is not typically used for executing real trades, but it can be used for backtesting trading strategies, analyzing financial data, or simulating trading scenarios.

Here's a simple example of a trading simulation in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Simulate some price data
np.random.seed(0)
dates = pd.date_range('20210101', periods=100)
prices = pd.Series(np.random.randn(100), index=dates).cumsum()

# Define a simple trading strategy: buy if the price has decreased from the previous day, sell if it has increased
signals = prices.diff().lt(0)

# Simulate trades: buy at the closing price of the day after a signal, sell at the closing price of the next day
trades = pd.DataFrame({
    'price': prices,
    'signal': signals,
    'trade': signals.shift().fillna(False)
})

# Calculate returns
trades['return'] = trades['price'].diff().shift(-1) * trades['trade']

# Print trades
print(trades)

# Analyze returns
print('Total return:', trades['return'].sum())
print('Average return:', trades['return'].mean())
print('Standard deviation of returns:', trades['return'].std())
```

This code simulates a simple trading strategy on randomly generated price data. It buys when the price has decreased from the previous day and sells when the price has increased. The trades are executed at the closing price of the day. The returns from the trades are then calculated and analyzed.

Please note that this is a very simplistic simulation and should not be used for actual trading. Real trading involves many more factors, such as transaction costs, slippage, risk management, etc.
