Sure, I can provide a simple example of how a trade might be initiated using Python. For this example, let's assume that we are trading stocks and we are using an API to interact with a trading platform.

```python
import requests

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, api_key, api_url):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.api_url = api_url

    def initiate_trade(self, symbol, qty, side, type, time_in_force):
        data = {
            "symbol": symbol,
            "qty": qty,
            "side": side,
            "type": type,
            "time_in_force": time_in_force
        }

        headers = {
            "APCA-API-KEY-ID": self.api_key,
        }

        response = requests.post(f"{self.api_url}/v2/orders", json=data, headers=headers)

        if response.status_code == 200:
            print(f"Trade initiated successfully: {response.json()}")
        else:
            print(f"Failed to initiate trade: {response.json()}")

# Initialize PTM
ptm = PTM(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", api_url="https://paper-api.alpaca.markets")

# Initiate a trade
ptm.initiate_trade(symbol="AAPL", qty=1, side="buy", type="market", time_in_force="gtc")
```

This is a very simplified example and in a real-world scenario, you would need to handle errors and edge cases more thoroughly. Also, the trading strategy is not included in this example. The trading strategy would determine when and what kind of trades to initiate based on various factors such as market data, portfolio balance, risk tolerance, etc.

Please replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key. The example uses Alpaca's paper trading API, which allows you to test trading strategies without risking real money. The `initiate_trade` method sends a POST request to the API to create a new order. The order parameters (symbol, qty, side, type, time_in_force) are passed to the method as arguments.
