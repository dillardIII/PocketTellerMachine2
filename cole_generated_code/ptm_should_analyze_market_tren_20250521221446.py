To analyze market trends and patterns, we can use Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn. Here's a basic example of how you might start to analyze market trends and patterns using Python. This example uses historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data as dataframe
yf.pdr_override()
df = pdr.get_data_yahoo("AAPL", start="2020-01-01", end="2021-12-31")

# Calculate moving average
df['SMA_50'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
df['SMA_200'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Plot closing price, short-term and long-term moving averages 
plt.figure(figsize=[15,10])
plt.grid(True)
plt.plot(df['Close'],label='Close', color='black')
plt.plot(df['SMA_50'],label='50 Day SMA', color='red',linestyle='--')
plt.plot(df['SMA_200'],label='200 Day SMA', color='blue',linestyle='--')
plt.legend(loc=2)

# Linear Regression for trend analysis
df['Prediction'] = df['Close'].shift(-1)
X = np.array(df.drop(['Prediction'], 1))
X = X[:-1]
y = np.array(df['Prediction'])
y = y[:-1]

x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

lr = LinearRegression()
lr.fit(x_train, y_train)

lr_confidence = lr.score(x_test, y_test)
print("lr confidence: ", lr_confidence)
```

Please note that this is a basic example and doesn't provide a complete solution for identifying potential trading opportunities. For a more sophisticated analysis, you might need to use machine learning algorithms, sentiment analysis, and other advanced techniques. Also, this code won't run in this text-based environment. You need to run it in a Python environment.
