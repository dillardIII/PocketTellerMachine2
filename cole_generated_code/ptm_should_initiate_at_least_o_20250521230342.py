In order to initiate a trade and gather data to assess market trends, we would need to use an API from a trading platform. Here is an example of how it could be done using the Alpaca API, a platform for algorithmic trading.

Please note that this is a simplified example and real trading involves more considerations like error handling, security, and more complex strategies.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API connection
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Get account information
account = api.get_account()
print(account)

# Check if our account is restricted from trading.
if account.trading_blocked:
    print('Account is currently restricted from trading.')

# Check how much money we have to work with.
print('${} is available as cash'.format(account.cash))

# Get the last 100 days of price data for AAPL
barset = api.get_barset('AAPL', 'day', limit=100)
aapl_bars = barset['AAPL']

# See how much AAPL moved in that timeframe.
week_open = aapl_bars[0].o
week_close = aapl_bars[-1].c
percent_change = (week_close - week_open) / week_open * 100
print('AAPL moved {}% over the last 100 days'.format(percent_change))

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

Please replace '<APCA-API-KEY-ID>' and '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>' with your actual Alpaca API key ID and secret key.

This script will print out the account information, check if the account is restricted from trading, print out the available cash, calculate the percentage change of AAPL over the last 100 days, and then submit a market order to buy 1 share of AAPL.

Please remember, this is a simple example and real trading involves more considerations.
