The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. Here's a simple Python code for generating an RSI strategy.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

def calculate_RSI(data, window):
    delta = data.diff()
    up, down = delta.copy(), delta.copy()
    up[up < 0] = 0
    down[down > 0] = 0
    average_gain = up.rolling(window).mean()
    average_loss = abs(down.rolling(window).mean())
    rs = average_gain / average_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi

def implement_RSI_strategy(data, window=14):
    data['RSI'] = calculate_RSI(data['Adj Close'], window)
    data['Buy_Signal'] = np.where((data['RSI'] < 30), 1, 0) # oversold condition
    data['Sell_Signal'] = np.where((data['RSI'] > 70), -1, 0) # overbought condition
    return data

# Fetch data
data = web.DataReader('AAPL', data_source='yahoo', start='01-01-2020', end='12-31-2020')
data = implement_RSI_strategy(data)

print(data)
```

This script fetches historical data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) for the year 2020 from Yahoo Finance. It calculates the RSI for a window of 14 days (which is the most commonly used period) and generates buy signals when the RSI goes below 30 (oversold condition) and sell signals when the RSI goes above 70 (overbought condition).
