To diversify trading strategies, we can use different financial indicators and machine learning algorithms to predict the stock prices. Here is a simple Python code using pandas, numpy, and sklearn to illustrate how we can use moving average and linear regression for this purpose.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Load the historical trading data
df = pd.read_csv('trading_data.csv')

# Calculate the moving average
df['MA_10'] = df['Price'].rolling(window=10).mean()
df['MA_50'] = df['Price'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a new dataframe to store the features for the model
features = df[['MA_10', 'MA_50']]

# Remove the rows with NaN values
features = features.dropna()

# Define the target variable, which is the price
target = df['Price'][features.index]

# Split the data into training set and test set
features_train, features_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Use linear regression as the model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(features_train, target_train)

# Use the model to make predictions
predicted_price = model.predict(features_test)

# Calculate the mean squared error of the predictions
print('Mean Squared Error:', metrics.mean_squared_error(target_test, predicted_price))
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to use more sophisticated techniques and consider more factors, such as the volume of trades, the opening/closing prices, the high/low prices of the day, etc. You may also want to use more advanced machine learning models and techniques, such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, etc.
