Sure, I can provide a basic skeleton of a Python code that might be used in a trading strategy. However, please note that this is a very simplified version and real trading algorithms involve complex mathematics and deep understanding of financial markets. Also, the actual implementation would require a secure and reliable connection to a trading platform, which is beyond the scope of this example.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class TradingStrategy:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.buy_signals = []
        self.sell_signals = []

    def calculate_indicators(self):
        # Calculate trading indicators
        # This is just a placeholder. Actual implementation will depend on the strategy
        self.data['moving_average'] = self.data['price'].rolling(window=20).mean()

    def generate_signals(self):
        # Generate trading signals based on indicators
        # This is just a placeholder. Actual implementation will depend on the strategy
        self.buy_signals = np.where(self.data['price'] > self.data['moving_average'], 1, 0)
        self.sell_signals = np.where(self.data['price'] < self.data['moving_average'], -1, 0)

    def execute_trades(self):
        # Execute trades based on signals
        # This is just a placeholder. Actual implementation will depend on the trading platform
        for i in range(len(self.data)):
            if self.buy_signals[i] == 1:
                print(f"Buy at price {self.data['price'].iloc[i]}")
            elif self.sell_signals[i] == -1:
                print(f"Sell at price {self.data['price'].iloc[i]}")

# Test the strategy
data = pd.DataFrame({'price': np.random.rand(100)})  # Replace with actual price data
strategy = TradingStrategy(data)
strategy.calculate_indicators()
strategy.generate_signals()
strategy.execute_trades()
```

This code defines a simple trading strategy that buys when the price is above a moving average and sells when the price is below the moving average. The `TradingStrategy` class can be extended to implement different strategies.
