Sure, I can provide a simple Python code that simulates a trading strategy. We will use the Moving Average Crossover strategy for this example. This strategy is one of the most commonly used strategies in trading. It involves two moving averages, one short-term and one long-term. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it's a signal to buy. When it crosses below, it's a signal to sell.

Please note that this is a simple example and real trading strategies can be much more complex and also need to consider transaction costs, risk management, etc.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    sma = data.rolling(window=window).mean()
    return sma

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    ema = data.ewm(span=window).mean()
    return ema

def trading_strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    # Calculate the short and long term moving averages
    sma_short = calculate_sma(data, short_window)
    sma_long = calculate_sma(data, long_window)

    # Create a 'signal' (invested or not invested) when the short moving average crosses the long moving average
    data['signal'] = 0.0
    data['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(sma_short[short_window:] > sma_long[short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

    # Generate trading orders
    data['positions'] = data['signal'].diff()

    return data

# Fetch data
data = web.DataReader('AAPL', 'yahoo', start='01/01/2020', end='01/01/2022')
data = data['Close']

# Implement the strategy
trading_data = trading_strategy(data, 50, 200)

# Print the DataFrame
print(trading_data)
```

In this script, we're fetching the historical price data for Apple stock from Yahoo Finance. We then calculate the short-term (50 days) and long-term (200 days) simple moving averages (SMA) for the closing prices. If the short-term SMA is greater than the long-term SMA, we generate a 'buy' signal, and if it's less, we generate a 'sell' signal. The 'positions' column shows the trading orders. A '1.0' means a 'buy' order and a '-1.0' means a 'sell' order.

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and should not be used for actual trading without further enhancements and testing.
