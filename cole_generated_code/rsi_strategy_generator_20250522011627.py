The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market.

Here is a simple Python code that generates an RSI strategy:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

yf.pdr_override()

def calculate_RSI(data, time_window):
    diff = data.diff(1).dropna()        # diff in one field(one day)

    up_chg = 0 * diff
    down_chg = 0 * diff
    
    # up change is equal to the positive difference, otherwise equal to zero
    up_chg[diff > 0] = diff[ diff>0 ]
    
    # down change is equal to negative deifference, otherwise equal to zero
    down_chg[diff < 0] = diff[ diff < 0 ]
    
    # calculate the EWMA
    up_chg_avg   = up_chg.ewm(com=time_window-1 , min_periods=time_window).mean()
    down_chg_avg = down_chg.ewm(com=time_window-1 , min_periods=time_window).mean()
    
    rs = abs(up_chg_avg/down_chg_avg)
    rsi = 100 - 100/(1+rs)
    return rsi

def implement_RSI_strategy(data, rsi):
    buy_price = []
    sell_price = []
    rsi_signal = []
    signal = 0

    for i in range(len(data)):
        if rsi[i-1] < 30:
            if signal != 1:
                buy_price.append(data[i])
                sell_price.append(np.nan)
                signal = 1
                rsi_signal.append(signal)
            else:
                buy_price.append(np.nan)
                sell_price.append(np.nan)
                rsi_signal.append(0)
        elif rsi[i-1] > 70:
            if signal != -1:
                sell_price.append(data[i])
                buy_price.append(np.nan)
                signal = -1
                rsi_signal.append(signal)
            else:
                buy_price.append(np.nan)
                sell_price.append(np.nan)
                rsi_signal.append(0)
        else:
            buy_price.append(np.nan)
            sell_price.append(np.nan)
            rsi_signal.append(0)
            
    return buy_price, sell_price, rsi_signal

# Fetch data
data = pdr.get_data_yahoo("AAPL", start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")['Adj Close']

# Calculate RSI
rsi = calculate_RSI(data, 14)

# Implement RSI Strategy
buy_price, sell_price, rsi_signal = implement_RSI_strategy(data, rsi)
```

In this code, we first fetch the historical data of a stock (in this case, AAPL) using `yfinance` library. Then, we calculate the RSI using a 14-day window which is the most commonly used window for RSI calculation. After that, we implement the RSI strategy which is to buy when the RSI is below 30 (oversold condition) and sell when the RSI is above 70 (overbought condition). The `buy_price`, `sell_price`, and `rsi_signal` lists contain the prices at which the stock is bought or sold and the current signal (1 for buy, -1 for sell, 0 for hold), respectively.
