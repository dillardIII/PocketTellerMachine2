Sure, I can help you write a simple Python code using the Alpaca API, which is a platform that allows for algorithmic trading. This code will initiate a trade by buying one share of Apple Inc. (AAPL). Please replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_ID' and 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' with your actual Alpaca API key and secret key.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API connection
api = tradeapi.REST('YOUR_API_KEY_ID', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Get account info
account = api.get_account()
print(account)

# Check if our account is restricted from trading.
if account.trading_blocked:
    print('Account is currently restricted from trading.')

# Check how much money we have to work with.
print('${} is available as cash'.format(account.cash))

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code will print your account information, check if your account is restricted from trading, print the amount of cash available in your account, and submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock. Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading involves more complexity and risk.

Also, please note that this code uses Alpaca's paper trading API, which simulates trades but doesn't actually execute them in the real market. This is a great way to gain practical market experience without risking real money.
