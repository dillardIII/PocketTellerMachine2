Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, I'll assume that you're running a function to perform a backtest, and if no results are found, you'll want to run a different function as your fallback.

```python
def backtest_strategy():
    # Your code for backtesting goes here
    # This is just a placeholder
    results = None

    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")
        # Continue with your normal processing

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your code for the fallback strategy goes here
    print("Fallback strategy is now running.")

# Run the backtest
backtest_strategy()
```

In this code, the `backtest_strategy` function is where you'd put your code for backtesting. If no results are found (which I've simulated by setting `results = None`), then the `fallback_strategy` function is called. You'd replace the print statement in the `fallback_strategy` function with whatever you want your fallback to be.
