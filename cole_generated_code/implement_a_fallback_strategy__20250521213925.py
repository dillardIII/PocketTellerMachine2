Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This example assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs your backtest and returns the results, or `None` if no results are found.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    results = run_backtest()

    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Here you can implement your fallback strategy.
        # For example, you might want to run a different backtest, or use some default results.
        results = run_fallback_strategy()

    return results

def run_backtest():
    # Your code to run the backtest goes here.
    # This function should return the results of the backtest, or None if no results are found.
    pass

def run_fallback_strategy():
    # Your code to run the fallback strategy goes here.
    # This function should return the results of the fallback strategy.
    pass
```

You would need to replace the `pass` statements with your actual code to run the backtest and the fallback strategy. The `get_backtest_results()` function checks if the backtest results are `None`, and if so, it runs the fallback strategy and returns those results instead.
