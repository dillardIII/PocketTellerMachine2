To conduct a thorough market analysis, we would need to use a combination of data analysis libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, as well as financial data from sources like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage. Here's a basic example of how you might start this analysis using Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf

# Override pandas_datareader's get_data_yahoo() method to download data faster
yf.pdr_override()

# Define the list of stocks we want to analyze
stocks = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'FB']

# Define the start and end dates for our analysis
start_date = '2020-01-01'
end_date = '2022-12-31'

# Download the data
stock_data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(stocks, start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Calculate daily returns
stock_data['Daily Return'] = stock_data['Adj Close'].pct_change()

# Plot the daily returns
stock_data['Daily Return'].plot(figsize=(15, 6))
plt.show()

# Identify potential trading opportunities by finding stocks with the highest daily returns
top_stocks = stock_data['Daily Return'].idxmax()
print('Stocks with the highest daily returns:')
print(top_stocks)
```

This is a very basic analysis and doesn't take into account many factors that could influence trading decisions, such as market trends, company news, economic indicators, etc. For a more thorough analysis, you might want to consider using machine learning algorithms to predict future prices, or use sentiment analysis to gauge market sentiment.

Also, please note that this code requires the `yfinance` and `pandas_datareader` libraries. If these are not installed, you can do so using pip:

```
pip install yfinance pandas_datareader
```

This code also assumes that you have the necessary permissions to download data from Yahoo Finance. If not, you might need to sign up for an API key.
