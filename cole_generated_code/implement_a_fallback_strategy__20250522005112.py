Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python:

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Perform backtest
    backtest_results = strategy.backtest()

    # Check if backtest results are empty
    if not backtest_results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")

        # Define your fallback strategy here
        fallback_strategy = FallbackStrategy()

        # Perform backtest with fallback strategy
        fallback_results = fallback_strategy.backtest()

        # Check if fallback results are also empty
        if not fallback_results:
            print("No fallback results found. Please check your strategies.")
            return None
        else:
            return fallback_results
    else:
        return backtest_results
```

This code first tries to backtest the initial strategy. If no results are found, it implements a fallback strategy (which you would need to define) and tries to backtest that. If no results are found for the fallback strategy either, it returns `None` and prints a message to check the strategies. 

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and might need adjustments based on your specific needs and the structure of your strategies and backtest methods.
