Your request is quite broad, but I'll provide a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic trading strategy using Moving Average Crossover. This strategy is often used in algorithmic trading. 

In this strategy, we will use two moving averages: a fast moving average (shorter period) and a slow moving average (longer period). A buy signal is generated when the fast moving average crosses above the slow moving average, and a sell signal is generated when the fast moving average crosses below the slow moving average.

For this example, we'll use `pandas` for data manipulation and `yfinance` to download the stock data. Please make sure to install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas yfinance
```

Here is the Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
def download_data(stock, start='2000-01-01', end='2020-12-31'):
    data = yf.download(stock, start, end)
    return pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate moving averages
def calculate_moving_averages(data, short_window=50, long_window=200):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Short moving average
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Long moving average
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                                > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
    # Generate trading orders
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Download stock data
data = download_data('AAPL')

# Calculate moving averages and generate signals
signals = calculate_moving_averages(data)

# Print signals
print(signals)
```

This code downloads historical data for the Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, calculates short-term (50 days) and long-term (200 days) moving averages, generates trading signals based on these moving averages, and prints the signals.

Please note that this is a very simple trading strategy and may not be profitable in real trading. Always backtest your strategies before live trading. Also, this code does not include any risk management or portfolio optimization techniques, which are crucial for successful trading.
