Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs a backtest and returns the results, or `None` if no results are found. The fallback strategy here is to simply print a message and return an empty list.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function should run the backtest and return the results
    # If no results are found, it should return None
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
    # Implement your fallback strategy here
    return []

def main():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None:
        results = fallback_strategy()
    return results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please replace the `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` functions with your actual implementation. The `fallback_strategy()` function should return a value that makes sense in the context of your application.
