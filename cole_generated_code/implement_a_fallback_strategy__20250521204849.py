Sure, here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, I'm assuming that the backtest function returns None when no results are found. The fallback strategy is to simply print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your actual backtest function
    # It should return the backtest results if they exist, and None otherwise
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy.")
    # This is a placeholder for your actual fallback strategy
    # It should return the fallback results
    return {}

def run_backtest(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        results = fallback_strategy()
    return results
```

You would need to replace the `backtest` and `fallback_strategy` functions with your actual implementation. The `run_backtest` function is what you would call to run the backtest and automatically use the fallback strategy if necessary.
