Sure, here is a simple example of a Python code that implements two trading strategies: Mean Reversion and Momentum. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading strategies are much more complex and involve a lot more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assuming we have a DataFrame 'df' with 'Close' prices of a stock

# Mean Reversion Strategy
def mean_reversion(df, window=20):
    # Calculate the mean of the past 20 days
    mean = df['Close'].rolling(window).mean()
    
    # Buy if the price is 2% less than the mean
    df['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(df['Close'] < mean*0.98, 1, 0)
    
    # Sell if the price is 2% more than the mean
    df['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(df['Close'] > mean*1.02, 1, 0)
    
    return df

# Momentum Strategy
def momentum(df, window=20):
    # Calculate the difference in price from 20 days ago
    momentum = df['Close'].diff(window)
    
    # Buy if momentum is positive
    df['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(momentum > 0, 1, 0)
    
    # Sell if momentum is negative
    df['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(momentum < 0, 1, 0)
    
    return df

# Implement the strategies
df = mean_reversion(df)
df = momentum(df)
```

This code will add 'Buy_Signal' and 'Sell_Signal' columns to the DataFrame for each strategy. A value of 1 means that the condition for buying or selling is met.

Please replace 'df' with your actual DataFrame and adjust the window size and thresholds according to your needs. 

Also, please note that this code does not take into account transaction costs, slippage, risk management, or other important factors for a real trading strategy. It's highly recommended to backtest any trading strategy before live trading.
