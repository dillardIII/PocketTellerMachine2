Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade using a hypothetical stock market API. Please note that this is a simulation and does not actually initiate a real trade.

```python
import requests
import json

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, api_key, url):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.url = url

    def get_stock_price(self, stock_symbol):
        response = requests.get(f'{self.url}/stock/{stock_symbol}/quote?token={self.api_key}')
        data = json.loads(response.text)
        return data['latestPrice']

    def initiate_trade(self, stock_symbol, quantity):
        stock_price = self.get_stock_price(stock_symbol)
        total_cost = stock_price * quantity
        print(f'Initiated trade. Bought {quantity} shares of {stock_symbol} at {stock_price} each. Total cost: {total_cost}')

# Replace 'your_api_key' and 'your_url' with your actual API key and URL
ptm = PTM('your_api_key', 'your_url')

# Replace 'AAPL' with the stock symbol you want to trade and 10 with the quantity you want to buy
ptm.initiate_trade('AAPL', 10)
```

This code first gets the current price of the stock using the `get_stock_price` method and then initiates a trade using the `initiate_trade` method. The trade details are then printed out.

Please note that you would need to replace `'your_api_key'` and `'your_url'` with your actual API key and URL. Also, replace `'AAPL'` with the stock symbol you want to trade and `10` with the quantity you want to buy. 

Please also note that this is a hypothetical scenario and the actual implementation may vary based on the specific API you are using. Always refer to the API documentation for accurate information.
