Sure, here's a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic trading strategy. This strategy is based on a simple moving average (SMA) crossover, which is a common trading strategy. Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading strategies can be much more complex and require thorough backtesting.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    sma = data.rolling(window=window).mean()
    return sma

def trading_strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    # Calculate the short and long window simple moving averages
    data['short_sma'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], short_window)
    data['long_sma'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], long_window)

    # Create a column 'Signal' such that if the short window SMA is greater than long window SMA then buy else sell
    data['Signal'] = 0.0  
    data['Signal'][short_window:] = np.where(data['short_sma'][short_window:] > data['long_sma'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

    # Generate trading orders using the 'Signal' column, buy if signal is 1, else sell
    data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

    return data

def fetch_data(symbol):
    df = web.DataReader(symbol, 'yahoo')
    return df

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Fetch the data
    data = fetch_data('AAPL')

    # Define the short and long window SMA periods
    short_window = 40
    long_window = 100

    # Implement the trading strategy
    trading_data = trading_strategy(data, short_window, long_window)

    # Print the trading data
    print(trading_data)
```
This script fetches historical price data for a given stock symbol (in this case, 'AAPL' for Apple Inc.), calculates the short and long window SMAs, generates trading signals based on the SMA crossover, and then generates trading orders based on these signals. 

Please note that this script requires pandas, numpy, and pandas_datareader libraries. Also, this strategy doesn't take into account transaction costs or slippage, and it assumes that you can trade at the closing price, which may not be possible in a real trading scenario.
