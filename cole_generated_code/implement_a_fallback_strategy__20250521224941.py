Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. The fallback strategy could be anything, but in this case, I'm just printing a message to the console.

```python
def backtest(trading_strategy):
    # Assume this function runs a backtest on the given trading strategy
    # and returns the results if successful, or None if no results found
    # This is just a placeholder for the actual backtest implementation
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is the fallback strategy. It could be anything, but in this case,
    # it's just printing a message to the console.
    print("No backtest results found. Falling back to default strategy.")

def run_backtest(trading_strategy):
    results = backtest(trading_strategy)
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Process the backtest results
        print("Backtest results:", results)

# Run the backtest with a given trading strategy
run_backtest("my_trading_strategy")
```

In this code, `run_backtest` is the main function that runs the backtest on a given trading strategy. If the `backtest` function returns `None` (indicating that no results were found), it calls the `fallback_strategy` function. Otherwise, it processes the backtest results (in this case, just prints them to the console).

Please replace the placeholder functions `backtest` and `fallback_strategy` with the actual implementation as per your requirements.
