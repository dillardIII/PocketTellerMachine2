Sure, here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this example, I'll assume that the backtest function returns None when no results are found.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest function
    # It should return the backtest results if they exist, otherwise None
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your fallback strategy
    # It should return the results of the fallback strategy
    pass

def run_backtest(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")
        results = fallback_strategy()
    return results
```

In this code, `run_backtest` is the main function you would call to run a backtest. If the `backtest` function returns `None` (indicating that no backtest results were found), it runs the `fallback_strategy` function instead. 

Please replace the `backtest` and `fallback_strategy` functions with your actual implementation.
