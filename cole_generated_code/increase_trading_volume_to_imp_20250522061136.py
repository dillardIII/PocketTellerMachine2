To increase trading volume in Python, you would typically adjust the number of shares you are buying or selling in your trading algorithm. Here's a simple example of how you might do this:

```python
class TradingStrategy:
    def __init__(self, initial_volume=1):
        self.volume = initial_volume

    def increase_volume(self, increment):
        self.volume += increment

    def make_trade(self, stock_price):
        # This is a very simple trading strategy that always buys
        # It's just an example and not intended for real trading
        return 'buy', self.volume * stock_price

# Usage
trading_strategy = TradingStrategy(initial_volume=10)
print(trading_strategy.make_trade(100))  # Buy 10 shares at $100 each

trading_strategy.increase_volume(5)
print(trading_strategy.make_trade(100))  # Buy 15 shares at $100 each
```

In this example, the `TradingStrategy` class has a method `increase_volume` that you can use to increase the trading volume. The `make_trade` method then uses this volume to determine how many shares to buy.

Please note that this is a very simplified example. A real trading strategy would need to take into account many other factors, such as the current balance, the price trend of the stock, etc. Also, increasing trading volume will increase potential profits, but it will also increase potential losses. It's important to manage risk appropriately.
