Here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. This code does not connect to any real trading platform, but it gives an idea of how such a system could be implemented.

```python
import random
import time

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, symbol, volume):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.volume = volume
        self.timestamp = time.time()

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []

    def initiate_trade(self, symbol, volume):
        new_trade = Trade(symbol, volume)
        self.trades.append(new_trade)
        print(f"Trade initiated: {new_trade.symbol} for {new_trade.volume} at {new_trade.timestamp}")

    def gather_data(self):
        data = [(trade.symbol, trade.volume, trade.timestamp) for trade in self.trades]
        return data

ptm = PTM()
ptm.initiate_trade("AAPL", 100)  # Initiate a trade

data = ptm.gather_data()  # Gather data
print(data)
```

In this code, we have two classes: `Trade` and `PTM`. `Trade` represents a single trade and `PTM` represents the trading system. The `initiate_trade` method in `PTM` initiates a trade and stores it in the `trades` list. The `gather_data` method returns the data of all trades for analysis. 

Please note that this is a simplified example and real trading systems are much more complex and involve real-time data from stock exchanges, sophisticated algorithms to decide when to buy or sell, and secure mechanisms to execute trades.
