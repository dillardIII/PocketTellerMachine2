As an AI, I can't directly interact with your trading systems, but I can provide you with a Python script that you can use to check the status of your trading systems. This script will check if the system is up and running. However, to conduct a thorough review, you might need to perform specific checks based on the nature of your trading systems. 

Here's a basic Python script to check if a web-based trading system is up and running:

```python
import requests

def check_system_status(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return "The trading system at {} is up and running.".format(url)
        else:
            return "The trading system at {} is not functioning optimally. Status code: {}".format(url, response.status_code)
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return "There was an error while trying to reach the trading system at {}. Error: {}".format(url, str(e))

# Replace 'your_trading_system_url' with the URL of your trading system
url = 'your_trading_system_url'
print(check_system_status(url))
```

This script uses the `requests` library to send a GET request to the specified URL. If the response status code is 200, it means the system is up and running. If it's anything other than 200, there might be an issue. If there's an exception while trying to reach the URL, it will also be caught and reported.

Please note that this is a very basic check. A thorough review would involve checking the system logs, performance metrics, error rates, and other system-specific checks, which would require a more complex script and possibly direct access to the system.
