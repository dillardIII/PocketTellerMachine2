Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that the backtest results are stored in a list. If the list is empty, the fallback strategy is implemented.

```python
def backtest_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest strategy function
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your fallback strategy function
    pass

# Assume backtest_results is a list containing your backtest results
backtest_results = []

if not backtest_results:
    print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    print("Backtest results found. Implementing backtest strategy.")
    backtest_strategy()
```

Please replace the `backtest_strategy` and `fallback_strategy` functions with your actual strategy functions. The `backtest_results` list should also be replaced with the actual list of your backtest results.
