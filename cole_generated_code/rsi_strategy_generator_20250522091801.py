The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market.

Here is a simple Python code using the `pandas` and `yfinance` libraries to generate an RSI strategy:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_RSI(data, period=14):
    delta = data.diff()
    up, down = delta.copy(), delta.copy()
    up[up < 0] = 0
    down[down > 0] = 0
    average_gain = up.rolling(window=period).mean()
    average_loss = abs(down.rolling(window=period).mean())
    rs = average_gain / average_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi

def RSI_Strategy(data, rsi_period=14, rsi_upper=70, rsi_lower=30):
    data['RSI'] = calculate_RSI(data['Close'], rsi_period)
    data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['RSI'] < rsi_lower)
    data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['RSI'] > rsi_upper)
    return data

# Fetching data
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Applying RSI Strategy
data = RSI_Strategy(data)

print(data)
```

This code fetches historical data for a specific ticker symbol (in this case, 'AAPL' for Apple Inc.) and calculates the RSI for each day. It then generates a 'Buy_Signal' when the RSI is below a lower threshold (indicating the asset is oversold) and a 'Sell_Signal' when the RSI is above an upper threshold (indicating the asset is overbought). The thresholds are set to 30 and 70 by default, but these can be adjusted.
