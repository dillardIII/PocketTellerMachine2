To analyze market trends and patterns, we can use Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computation, matplotlib for visualization, and sklearn for machine learning. Here's a basic example of how you might set up a program to analyze market trends:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
def load_data(file_name):
    return pd.read_csv(file_name)

# Analyze the trend
def analyze_trend(data):
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(np.array(data.index).reshape((-1, 1)), data['Price'])
    trend = model.predict(np.array(data.index).reshape((-1, 1)))
    return trend

# Visualize the trend
def visualize_trend(data, trend):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
    plt.plot(data['Price'], label='Actual Price')
    plt.plot(data.index, trend, label='Trend', linestyle='--')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

# Load the data
data = load_data('market_data.csv')

# Analyze the trend
trend = analyze_trend(data)

# Visualize the trend
visualize_trend(data, trend)
```

This is a very basic example and real-world trading decisions would require a much more complex analysis. This code assumes that you have a csv file named 'market_data.csv' with a 'Price' column. The trend is calculated using a simple linear regression model, which may not be the best choice for this kind of data. The trend is then visualized using matplotlib.

Please note that making informed trading decisions requires a deep understanding of financial markets and cannot be reliably done with a simple script. It's recommended to use advanced techniques like time series analysis, machine learning, and deep learning, and even then, there's always a risk involved in trading.
