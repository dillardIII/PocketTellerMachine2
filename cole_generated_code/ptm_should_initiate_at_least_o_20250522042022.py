Sure, I can help you write a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. However, please note that this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms are much more complex and require a deep understanding of financial markets.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance

    def initiate_trade(self, trade_value):
        if self.balance < trade_value:
            print("Insufficient balance for this trade.")
            return False
        else:
            self.balance -= trade_value
            print(f"Trade initiated with value {trade_value}. Remaining balance: {self.balance}")
            return True

    def check_trade_result(self):
        # This is a very simplified simulation where we assume a 50% chance of winning
        return random.choice([True, False])

    def update_balance(self, trade_value):
        trade_result = self.check_trade_result()
        if trade_result:
            self.balance += trade_value * 2  # Assuming we get double the trade value if we win
            print(f"Trade won. Current balance: {self.balance}")
        else:
            print("Trade lost.")

# Create a PTM with initial balance of 1000
ptm = PTM(1000)

# Try to initiate a trade with value 500
if ptm.initiate_trade(500):
    ptm.update_balance(500)
```

This code creates a PTM (Pretend Trading Machine) with an initial balance. The PTM can initiate a trade if it has enough balance. After a trade is initiated, it checks the result of the trade (win or lose) and updates the balance accordingly. In this simple simulation, there's a 50% chance of winning a trade. If the trade is won, the PTM gets double the trade value added to its balance.
