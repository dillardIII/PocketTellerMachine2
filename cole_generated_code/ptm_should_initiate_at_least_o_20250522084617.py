Sure, here is a simple example of how you might use Python to initiate a trade using the Alpaca API, a popular platform for algorithmic trading. 

Please note that you need to replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your own API keys from Alpaca.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API connection
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Get account information
account = api.get_account()
print(account)

# Check if our account is restricted from trading.
if account.trading_blocked:
    print('Account is currently restricted from trading.')

# Check how much money we have to work with.
print('${} is available as cash'.format(account.cash))

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock at the current market price. The trade is a 'good till cancelled' order, meaning it will remain open until it is either filled or manually cancelled.

Please note that this code is for illustrative purposes and should not be used for real trading without proper error handling and additional features.
