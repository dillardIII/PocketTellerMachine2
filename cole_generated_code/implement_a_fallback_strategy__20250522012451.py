Sure, here's a basic example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This example assumes that you have a function named `run_backtest()` that runs a backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, it returns `None`.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function should run the backtest and return the results
    # If no results are found, it should return None
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement your fallback strategy
    pass

# Run the backtest
backtest_results = run_backtest()

# If no results are found, use the fallback strategy
if backtest_results is None:
    print("No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy.")
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    print("Backtest results found.")
    # Process the backtest results
    pass
```

In this code, if `run_backtest()` returns `None`, the `fallback_strategy()` function is called. You would need to replace the `pass` statements with your own code. The `run_backtest()` function should run the backtest and return the results, and the `fallback_strategy()` function should implement your fallback strategy.
