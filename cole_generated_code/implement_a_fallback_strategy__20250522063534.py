Sure, here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the fallback strategy will be to return a message stating that no backtest results were found and recommending to check the trading parameters or the data source.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy, data):
    # Assume that `run_backtest` is a function that runs the backtest on the given strategy and data
    # And returns None if no results were found
    results = run_backtest(strategy, data)
    
    if results is None:
        return fallback_strategy()
    
    return results

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results were found. Please check your trading parameters or data source.")
    # Here you can implement any other fallback actions, like logging the event, sending a notification, etc.
```

This is a very basic implementation and might need to be adjusted based on the specifics of your project. For example, you might want to implement more complex fallback strategies, like trying different trading parameters or data sources.
