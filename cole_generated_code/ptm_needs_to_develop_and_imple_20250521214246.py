Sure, here's a basic example of a Python code that could be used to implement a simple trading strategy. This strategy is based on moving averages, a common indicator used in trading. Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading strategies can be much more complex.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Collect data on this ticker
tickerData = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickerSymbol, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
tickerData['MA10'] = tickerData['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
tickerData['MA50'] = tickerData['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Define a signal
tickerData['Signal'] = 0.0  
tickerData['Signal'][tickerData['MA10'] > tickerData['MA50']] = 1.0

# Generate trading orders
tickerData['Position'] = tickerData['Signal'].diff()

# Print data
print(tickerData)

# Implement the strategy
for i in range(len(tickerData)):
    if tickerData['Position'][i] == 1.0:
        print('Buy on', tickerData.index[i], 'at the price of', tickerData['Close'][i])
    elif tickerData['Position'][i] == -1.0:
        print('Sell on', tickerData.index[i], 'at the price of', tickerData['Close'][i])
```

This script fetches historical price data for a given ticker (in this case, AAPL for Apple Inc.), calculates 10-day and 50-day moving averages, generates a trading signal based on the relationship between these two averages, and finally generates trading orders based on changes in this signal.

Please note that you need to install the 'pandas_datareader' and 'yfinance' libraries to fetch data from Yahoo Finance. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas_datareader yfinance
```

Also, this is a very basic strategy and might not be profitable in real trading. Always backtest your strategies before using them in live trading.
