Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to return a message saying no backtest results were found.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    # This is a placeholder for the actual code that fetches backtest results.
    # It should return None if no results are found.
    backtest_results = fetch_backtest_results()

    if backtest_results is None:
        # Fallback strategy: return a message saying no results were found.
        return "No backtest results were found."

    return backtest_results

def fetch_backtest_results():
    # Placeholder for the actual code that fetches backtest results.
    # This function should return None if no results are found.
    pass
```

In this code, `fetch_backtest_results()` is a placeholder for the actual function that fetches backtest results. If no results are found, it should return `None`. The `get_backtest_results()` function then checks if `fetch_backtest_results()` returned `None`, and if so, it implements the fallback strategy of returning a message saying no results were found.

Please replace `fetch_backtest_results()` with the actual function that fetches backtest results in your trading system.
