Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the fallback strategy is to return a message saying "No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy." 

Please note that the specifics of your fallback strategy would depend on the details of your trading system and what you'd want to do in the event of no backtest results.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume this function returns backtest results for a given strategy
    # The details of this function would depend on your trading system
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # Define your fallback strategy here
    print("No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy.")

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    backtest_results = backtest_strategy(strategy)
    
    if not backtest_results:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Execute the strategy with the backtest results
        pass
```

In this code, `execute_strategy` is the main function you would call to execute a trading strategy. It first attempts to backtest the strategy by calling `backtest_strategy`. If no backtest results are found (i.e., `backtest_strategy` returns `None` or an empty list), it calls `fallback_strategy`. Otherwise, it would proceed with the strategy execution using the backtest results.
