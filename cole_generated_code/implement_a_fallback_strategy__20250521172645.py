Sure, below is a simple implementation of the task given in python:

```python
def backtest_strategy(df):
    """
    This function implements a trading strategy on the given dataset 'df' and returns the results.
    """    
    # Implement your backtesting code here
    results = {} # This will contain the backtest results

    # Let's assume the backtest is done, and results are filled.
    # For the sake of example, I'm leaving this part empty.

    return results

def fallback_strategy():
    """
    This function implements a fallback trading strategy when no backtest results are found.
    """
    # Implement your fallback strategy here
    print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
    fallback_results = {} # This will contain the fallback strategy results
    
    # Let's assume the fallback strategy is done, and fallback_results are filled.
    # For the sake of example, I'm leaving this part empty.

    return fallback_results

# Use the backtest strategy on a data (assuming df is your data-frame)
df = None # This is placeholder for your dataset

results = backtest_strategy(df)

# Implement fallback, if no backtest results are found
if not results:
    results = fallback_strategy()
```

Please note that this is a simple implementation in which we check if `results` are empty or not, and if empty, we execute the fallback strategy. The actual implementation of backtest and fallback strategies are dependent on your particular use-case.
