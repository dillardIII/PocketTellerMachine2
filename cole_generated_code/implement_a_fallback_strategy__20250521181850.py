Sure, I have written a basic implementation of Python code based on your requirement. The fallback strategy here is just simply showing a message saying no backtest results are found as alternative action could be highly specific based on the trading strategy or system in place.

```python
def retrieve_backtest_results():
    # Implement your logic to retrieve backtest results
    # Return None if no results are found
    pass

def fallback_action():
    # Fallback strategy when no backtest results are found
    print("No backtest results are found!")

def main():
    backtest_results = retrieve_backtest_results()
    if backtest_results is None:
        fallback_action()
    else:
        # Process the backtest results
        print(backtest_results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, we have a function `retrieve_backtest_results()` which is supposed to fetch the backtest results. If no results are found, it should return `None`.

The function `fallback_action()` is to be used when no backtest results are provided.

In the `main()` function, we get the backtest results and if they are `None`, we call the `fallback_action()` method. If the results are not `None`, we process the results. The code for processing the results is not provided here as it would depend on the specific requirements of your use-case.
