As an AI, I can't review and optimize the trading algorithms directly since I don't have access to your codebase and data. However, I can provide a general Python code structure for optimizing a trading algorithm using machine learning techniques. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load your trading data
# data = pd.read_csv('your_trading_data.csv')

# Preprocess the data
# X = data.iloc[:, :-1].values
# y = data.iloc[:, -1].values

# Split the data into training and testing sets
# X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Feature Scaling
# sc = StandardScaler()
# X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
# X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

# Train the Random Forest model
# regressor = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=20, random_state=0)
# regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting the Test set results
# y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)

# Evaluating the Algorithm
# print('Mean Squared Error:', mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
```

This is a basic example of using the Random Forest algorithm to optimize a trading strategy. You can replace the RandomForestRegressor with any other machine learning model based on your needs. You would need to replace 'your_trading_data.csv' with the actual path to your trading data file. 

Remember, optimizing trading algorithms is a complex task that involves not only machine learning but also deep understanding of financial markets. You may need to consider other factors such as transaction costs, market impact, timing risk, etc. 

Also, please note that this code is a basic template and might need modifications based on your specific use case.
