To analyze market trends and adjust trading strategies, we can use a variety of tools and techniques. Here is a simple example of how you might use Python to analyze market trends using pandas, numpy and sklearn libraries. This is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take many more factors into account.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load market data into a pandas DataFrame
# This data should include features that might be relevant for predicting market trends
# For example, it might include the past prices of different stocks
# In this example, we assume that the data is stored in a CSV file
market_data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Split the data into features and target variable
# In this example, we assume that we're trying to predict the price of a particular stock
X = market_data.drop('stock_price', axis=1)
y = market_data['stock_price']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a linear regression model on the training data
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the model to predict the stock prices on the testing data
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# If the predicted price is higher than the current price, buy the stock
# If the predicted price is lower than the current price, sell the stock
for i in range(len(predictions)):
    if predictions[i] > X_test.iloc[i]['current_price']:
        print(f"Buy stock {X_test.iloc[i]['stock_name']}")
    elif predictions[i] < X_test.iloc[i]['current_price']:
        print(f"Sell stock {X_test.iloc[i]['stock_name']}")

```

Please note that this is a very simplified version of what a real trading algorithm might look like. Real trading algorithms take many more factors into account and use much more complex models. Also, this code does not actually execute any trades, it just prints out what action you should take based on the model's predictions.
