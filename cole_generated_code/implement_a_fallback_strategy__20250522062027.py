Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found.

```python
class TradingAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.backtest_results = None

    def run_backtest(self):
        # Code to run backtest
        # This is a placeholder as the backtest implementation will vary
        # The result of the backtest should be stored in self.backtest_results

        pass

    def fallback_strategy(self):
        # Fallback strategy implementation
        # This is a placeholder as the fallback strategy will vary
        print("Running fallback strategy...")

    def execute_strategy(self):
        self.run_backtest()

        if self.backtest_results is None:
            self.fallback_strategy()
        else:
            # Code to execute strategy based on backtest results
            pass

# Usage
assistant = TradingAssistant()
assistant.execute_strategy()
```

In this code, we have a `TradingAssistant` class which has methods to run a backtest, execute a fallback strategy, and execute a strategy based on backtest results. If the backtest results are `None`, the fallback strategy is executed. 

Please note that the actual implementation of running a backtest and the fallback strategy are not provided as they can vary greatly depending on the specific trading strategies and systems used.
