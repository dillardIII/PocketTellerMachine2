To initiate trades, we need to connect to a trading platform. Here is a simple example of how to use the Alpaca API, a platform for algorithmic trading, to initiate trades. 

First, you need to install the Alpaca API. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```python
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Then, you can use the following Python code to initiate trades:

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Replace these with your API connection info from the dashboard
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Check if the market is open
clock = api.get_clock()
if clock.is_open:
    # Get our account information
    account = api.get_account()

    # Check if our account is restricted from trading
    if account.trading_blocked:
        print('Account is currently restricted from trading.')
    else:
        # We could buy a random stock with 1/10 of our cash
        # But we want to start with a stock we know rather than a random stock
        # Here we use Apple Inc. (AAPL)
        symbol = 'AAPL'
        barset = api.get_barset(symbol, 'day', limit=5)
        aapl_bars = barset[symbol]

        # Calculate the average price of AAPL over the last 5 trading days.
        avg_price = sum([bar.c for bar in aapl_bars]) / len(aapl_bars)
        print(f'Average price of {symbol} over the last 5 trading days: {avg_price}')

        # Use the average price to calculate the number of shares we can buy
        shares_to_buy = account.cash // avg_price

        # But we want to buy only if we can buy at least one whole share
        if shares_to_buy > 0:
            print(f'Placing order to buy {shares_to_buy} shares of {symbol}')
            api.submit_order(
                symbol=symbol,
                qty=shares_to_buy,
                side='buy',
                type='market',
                time_in_force='gtc'
            )
        else:
            print('Not enough cash to buy a whole share.')
else:
    print('The market is currently closed.')
```

Please replace '<APCA-API-KEY-ID>' and '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>' with your actual Alpaca API key ID and secret key.

This script checks if the market is open and if the account is not restricted from trading. It then calculates the average price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) over the last 5 trading days and uses this to calculate how many shares it can buy with the cash available in the account. If it can buy at least one whole share, it places a market order to buy the shares. If it can't buy a whole share, it prints a message saying so. If the market is closed, it also prints a message saying so.

Please note that this is a simple example and real trading algorithms can be much more complex. Also, this script uses a paper trading account, which means it's using simulated money for trading. When you're ready to trade with real money, you can change the base_url to 'https://api.alpaca.markets'.
