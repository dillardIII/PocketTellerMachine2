Sure, here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, the fallback strategy is to return a message that no backtest results were found.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume this function returns backtest results
    results = get_backtest_results(strategy)

    if not results:
        return fallback_strategy()

    return results

def get_backtest_results(strategy):
    # This function would normally interact with your backtesting system
    # and return the results. For this example, it's just returning None
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is your fallback strategy. It could be anything you want,
    # for example, returning a default set of results, or raising an exception.
    # In this case, we're just returning a message.
    return "No backtest results found."

strategy = "My Trading Strategy"
print(backtest_strategy(strategy))
```

This code will print "No backtest results found." because the `get_backtest_results` function is returning `None`. You would replace this function with your actual function to get backtest results. If no results are found, the `fallback_strategy` function is called, which in this case just returns a message. You can replace this with your actual fallback strategy.
