Sure, here's an example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, I'll assume that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs a backtest and returns results. If no results are found, it returns `None`. The fallback strategy here is to run a different backtest `run_fallback_backtest()`.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    pass

def run_fallback_backtest():
    # Your fallback backtest code here
    pass

def execute_backtest():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback backtest.")
        results = run_fallback_backtest()
    return results

# Execute the backtest
backtest_results = execute_backtest()
```

In this code, `execute_backtest()` is the main function that you would call to execute your backtest. It first tries to run the main backtest using `run_backtest()`. If no results are found (i.e., `run_backtest()` returns `None`), it prints a message and then runs the fallback backtest using `run_fallback_backtest()`. The results of whichever backtest was run successfully are then returned.
