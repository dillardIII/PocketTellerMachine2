In order to initiate a trade, we first need to connect to a trading platform. For this example, we'll use Alpaca, a commission-free trading platform that provides a simple API for automated trading.

You'll need to install the Alpaca API by using pip:

```python
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Here is a simple Python code to initiate a trade:

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock at the current market price. The order type is 'market', which means it will be executed at the best available price in the market. The time in force is 'gtc' (good till cancelled), which means the order will stay active until it is filled or cancelled.

Please replace '<APCA-API-KEY-ID>' and '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>' with your actual Alpaca API key ID and secret key.

Please note that this is a paper trading API endpoint, which means it's for simulated trading and won't actually execute any trades in the real market. To trade with real money, you would need to switch to the live trading API endpoint and ensure you're aware of the risks involved in trading.
