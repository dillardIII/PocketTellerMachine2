Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic trading strategy. This strategy will be based on moving averages, which is a common technical analysis tool used in trading. Please note that this is a very simplified example and actual trading strategies can be much more complex and require thorough testing and analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

# Define the trading strategy
def trading_strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Create short simple moving average over the short window
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Create long simple moving average over the long window
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                                > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   

    # Generate trading orders
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Define the main function that fetches the data and applies the strategy
def main():
    # Define the ticker list
    tickers = ['AAPL']

    # Fetch the data
    data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickers, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

    # Apply the trading strategy
    signals = trading_strategy(data, short_window=40, long_window=100)

    # Print the signals
    print(signals)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code fetches historical price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance, calculates short-term (40 days) and long-term (100 days) moving averages, and generates trading signals based on these moving averages. When the short-term average is above the long-term average, it generates a buy signal (1.0), and when it's below, it generates a sell signal (0.0). The 'positions' column shows when the trading position changes.

Please note that you need to install pandas_datareader library to fetch data from Yahoo Finance. You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install pandas_datareader
```

Also, keep in mind that this is a very basic trading strategy and may not be profitable in real trading. Always test your strategies thoroughly before using them in live trading.
