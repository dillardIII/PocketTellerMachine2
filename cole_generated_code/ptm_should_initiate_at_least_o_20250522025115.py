Here's a simple example of how you might initiate a trade using Python. This example uses the `yfinance` library to download stock data, and the `bt` library to backtest trading strategies.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import bt

# Download historical data for desired ticker
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2021-12-31')

# Define the strategy
s = bt.Strategy('Buy and Hold', 
                [bt.algos.RunOnce(),
                 bt.algos.SelectAll(),
                 bt.algos.WeighEqually(),
                 bt.algos.Rebalance()])

# Create a backtest
test = bt.Backtest(s, data)

# Run the backtest
res = bt.run(test)

# Display the result
print(res)
```

This script will download the historical price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) and perform a simple "buy and hold" strategy, where all available capital is invested in the stock at the beginning of the period and held until the end.

Please note that this is a very simple example and real trading involves a lot more complexity. Also, this script doesn't actually perform any trades in the real market, it just simulates them based on historical data. To perform real trades, you would need to use a trading API like Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, or similar. Always be careful when trading with real money and make sure to test your strategies thoroughly before deploying them.
