Creating a Python script to analyze market trends and opportunities for potential trades is a complex task. It requires knowledge of financial markets, financial data analysis, and machine learning. Here is a simple example of how you might start to analyze market trends using Python. 

This script will use the `yfinance` library to download stock price data, and `pandas` to analyze it. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    sma = data.rolling(window=window).mean()
    return sma

def analyze_trends(stock_symbol):
    # Download historical data as dataframe
    data = yf.download(stock_symbol, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

    # Calculate 50 day simple moving average
    data['SMA_50'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], 50)

    # Calculate 200 day simple moving average
    data['SMA_200'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], 200)

    # Create a column to hold the buy/sell signals
    data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['SMA_50'] > data['SMA_200'])

    # Print data
    print(data)

# Analyze trends for a specific stock
analyze_trends('AAPL')
```

This script calculates the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) for a given stock. When the 50-day SMA is higher than the 200-day SMA, it generates a buy signal. This is a very basic trading strategy known as a golden cross.

Please note that this is a very simple example and should not be used for real trading decisions. Real-world trading algorithms take into account many more factors and use much more complex strategies.
