Without the exact details of your trading system, I can only provide you with the general framework for implementing a fallback mechanism. In this case, I have declared a hypothetical `backtest()` function, which contains all the logic of the back-testing of your trading strategies.
```python
def backtest(strategy):
    """
    The logic of this function will depend on what 'backtest' means in the specific trading system.
    I'm just assuming it returns a dictionary with backtest results or None if there's no results
    """
    # backtest logic here
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    """
    The logic of this function will depend on what 'fallback' means in the specific trading system.
    """
    print('No backtest results found, executing fallback strategy')
    # fallback strategy logic here
    
def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        pass  # normal strategy execution logic
        """
        If backtest results are found, the normal strategy execution logic will be implemented here.
        """
strategy = {'strategy_name': 'Strategy 1'}  # Just a sample strategy
execute_strategy(strategy)
```
In this code, the `execute_strategy()` function initially tries to run a backtest of the given trading strategy 'strategy'. If the backtest() function returns None (indicating that no backtest results were found), the code then runs its fallback strategy through the 'fallback_strategy()' function.
