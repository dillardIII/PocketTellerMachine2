Sure, here is a Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this example, I'll assume that the backtest results are stored in a list. If the list is empty, the fallback strategy will be executed.

```python
def backtest_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest strategy function
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your fallback strategy function
    pass

# Assume backtest_results is a list storing your backtest results
backtest_results = []

if backtest_results:
    # If backtest results are found, execute backtest strategy
    backtest_strategy()
else:
    # If no backtest results are found, execute fallback strategy
    fallback_strategy()
```

Please replace `backtest_strategy()` and `fallback_strategy()` with your actual strategy functions. Also, you should replace `backtest_results` with the actual variable or method you use to store or retrieve backtest results.
