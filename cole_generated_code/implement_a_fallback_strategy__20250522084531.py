Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python when no backtest results are found. This example uses a simple print statement as the fallback, but you could replace this with any action you'd like to take in the event of no backtest results.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest logic
    results = strategy.run_backtest()
    return results

def fallback():
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")

def main():
    # This is a placeholder for your strategy
    strategy = Strategy()

    results = backtest(strategy)
    if not results:
        fallback()
    else:
        print("Backtest results:", results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, `backtest()` is a function that runs a backtest on a given strategy and returns the results. If the results are empty (which in Python is equivalent to `False`), then the `fallback()` function is called. The `fallback()` function can be any code you want to execute when there are no backtest results.

Please replace `Strategy()` and `strategy.run_backtest()` with your actual strategy class and backtest method.
