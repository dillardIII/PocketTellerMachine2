The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. Here is a simple Python code to generate an RSI strategy.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime

def calculate_rsi(data, window):
    delta = data.diff()
    up, down = delta.copy(), delta.copy()
    up[up < 0] = 0
    down[down > 0] = 0

    average_gain = up.rolling(window=window).mean()
    average_loss = abs(down.rolling(window=window).mean())

    rs = average_gain / average_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi

def rsi_strategy(data, rsi, buy_level, sell_level):
    buy_signals = (rsi < buy_level)
    sell_signals = (rsi > sell_level)
    data['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(buy_signals, 1, 0)
    data['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(sell_signals, 1, 0)
    return data

# Download historical data
ticker = 'AAPL'
start_date = datetime(2020, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime(2021, 12, 31)
data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Calculate RSI
window = 14
data['RSI'] = calculate_rsi(data['Close'], window)

# Generate RSI strategy
buy_level = 30
sell_level = 70
strategy = rsi_strategy(data, data['RSI'], buy_level, sell_level)

print(strategy)
```

This script downloads historical data for a specific ticker symbol, calculates the RSI, and generates a trading strategy based on the RSI. The strategy generates a buy signal when the RSI is below a certain level (indicating the market is oversold) and a sell signal when the RSI is above a certain level (indicating the market is overbought).
