Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that performs the backtest and returns the results. If the results are `None`, it will execute the fallback strategy.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
    # Your fallback strategy code here
    pass

# Run backtest
backtest_results = run_backtest()

# Check if backtest results are None
if backtest_results is None:
    # Execute fallback strategy
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    print("Backtest results found.")
```

Please replace the `pass` statements with your actual backtest and fallback strategy code. The `fallback_strategy` could be anything from sending an alert, running a different backtest, or even stopping the program, depending on your needs.
