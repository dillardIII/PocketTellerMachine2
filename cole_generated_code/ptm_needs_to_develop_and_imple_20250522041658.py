Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code that uses a basic moving average crossover strategy for trading. This strategy is one of the most common systematic trading methods. It involves the use of two moving averages: one short term and one long term. When the short term moving average crosses above the long term moving average, it's a signal to buy. Conversely, when the short term moving average crosses below the long term moving average, it's a signal to sell.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and in real trading scenarios, you would need more complex strategies and risk management. Also, you would need historical price data and a trading platform that supports automated trading.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    sma = data.rolling(window=window).mean()
    return sma

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    ema = data.ewm(span=window).mean()
    return ema

def trading_strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    # Calculate the short and long term moving averages
    short_mavg = calculate_sma(data, short_window)
    long_mavg = calculate_sma(data, long_window)

    # Create a 'signals' DataFrame with the signal information
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Generate trading signals based on moving averages
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(short_mavg[short_window:] > long_mavg[short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

    # Generate trading orders based on the signals
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Fetch historical data
start_date = '2010-01-01'
end_date = '2020-12-31'
data = web.DataReader('AAPL', 'yahoo', start_date, end_date)

# Define the short and long lookback periods
short_window = 40
long_window = 100

# Generate the trading signals
signals = trading_strategy(data['Close'], short_window, long_window)

# Print the signals
print(signals)
```

This code fetches historical price data for Apple Inc. from Yahoo Finance, calculates the short term and long term moving averages, generates trading signals based on these moving averages, and then generates trading orders based on these signals.
