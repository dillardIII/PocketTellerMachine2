Here is a simple example of a Python code that simulates a trade using a hypothetical trading API:

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, stock, quantity):
        self.stock = stock
        self.quantity = quantity

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # initial balance
        self.portfolio = {}  # stocks owned

    def buy(self, trade):
        # simulate the price of a stock
        price = 100
        cost = trade.quantity * price

        if cost > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient balance to complete the trade.")
            return

        self.balance -= cost
        self.portfolio[trade.stock] = self.portfolio.get(trade.stock, 0) + trade.quantity
        print(f"Bought {trade.quantity} of {trade.stock}. Remaining balance: {self.balance}")

    def sell(self, trade):
        if trade.stock not in self.portfolio or self.portfolio[trade.stock] < trade.quantity:
            print("Insufficient stocks to complete the trade.")
            return

        # simulate the price of a stock
        price = 100
        revenue = trade.quantity * price

        self.balance += revenue
        self.portfolio[trade.stock] -= trade.quantity
        print(f"Sold {trade.quantity} of {trade.stock}. Remaining balance: {self.balance}")


# create a PTM
ptm = PTM()

# initiate a trade
trade = Trade('AAPL', 10)
ptm.buy(trade)

# sell a stock
trade = Trade('AAPL', 5)
ptm.sell(trade)
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example and does not take into account many factors that are important in real trading such as fluctuating stock prices, fees, etc. Also, this example assumes a hypothetical trading API which does not exist. For real trading, you would need to use a real trading API such as Alpaca, TD Ameritrade, E*TRADE, etc.
