Sure, here is a simple Python code that implements a basic trading strategy. This strategy is based on diversifying the portfolio by investing in different stocks. The code uses the yfinance library to fetch stock data and pandas to handle the data.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and is not recommended for real trading. Also, it doesn't take into account transaction costs, taxes, and other factors that could affect the performance of the strategy.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class TradingStrategy:
    def __init__(self, stocks, start_date, end_date):
        self.stocks = stocks
        self.start_date = start_date
        self.end_date = end_date

    def fetch_data(self):
        data = yf.download(self.stocks, start=self.start_date, end=self.end_date)
        return data['Adj Close']

    def calculate_returns(self, data):
        returns = data.pct_change()
        return returns

    def implement_strategy(self):
        data = self.fetch_data()
        returns = self.calculate_returns(data)

        # Calculate mean returns and covariance of returns
        mean_returns = returns.mean()
        cov_matrix = returns.cov()

        # Number of portfolios to simulate
        num_portfolios = 10000
        results = np.zeros((3,num_portfolios))

        for i in range(num_portfolios):
            # Select random weights for portfolio holdings
            weights = np.random.random(len(self.stocks))
            weights /= np.sum(weights)

            # Calculate expected return, volatility and Sharpe ratio
            portfolio_return = np.sum(mean_returns * weights) * 252
            portfolio_std_dev = np.sqrt(np.dot(weights.T,np.dot(cov_matrix, weights))) * np.sqrt(252)
            results[0,i] = portfolio_return
            results[1,i] = portfolio_std_dev
            # Risk-free rate is assumed to be 0
            results[2,i] = results[0,i] / results[1,i]

        return results

# Define the stocks to be included in the portfolio
stocks = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'FB']

# Define the start and end dates for fetching the stock data
start_date = '2020-01-01'
end_date = '2021-12-31'

strategy = TradingStrategy(stocks, start_date, end_date)
results = strategy.implement_strategy()

# Find the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio
max_sharpe_idx = np.argmax(results[2])
sdp, rp = results[1,max_sharpe_idx], results[0,max_sharpe_idx]

print("The portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio has a return of", rp, "and a standard deviation of", sdp)
```

This code will output the return and standard deviation of the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio among the 10000 portfolios that it simulates. The Sharpe ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return, and a higher Sharpe ratio is generally better.
