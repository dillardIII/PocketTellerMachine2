Sure, here is a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This example assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that returns the results of a backtest, and that this function returns `None` when no backtest results are found.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function should run your backtest and return the results
    # If no results are found, it should return None
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement your fallback strategy
    pass

# Run the backtest
backtest_results = run_backtest()

# If no backtest results were found, run the fallback strategy
if backtest_results is None:
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    # Otherwise, proceed with the backtest results
    pass
```

In this code, you would replace `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` with your actual functions. The `run_backtest()` function should return the results of your backtest, and the `fallback_strategy()` function should implement whatever you want to happen when no backtest results are found.
