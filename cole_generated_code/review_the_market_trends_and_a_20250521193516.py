As an AI, I can't review market trends in real time. However, I can provide you with a Python script that uses a hypothetical data set to adjust a trading approach based on market trends. This script will use a simple moving average strategy, which is a common technical analysis tool used to smooth out price trends by filtering out the "noise" from random short-term price fluctuations.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assuming you have a DataFrame 'df' with 'Date' and 'Price' columns
df = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Calculate short-term 50 days moving average
df['SMA_50'] = df['Price'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Calculate long-term 200 days moving average
df['SMA_200'] = df['Price'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Create a column to hold the trade signals
df['Trade_Signal'] = np.where(df['SMA_50'] > df['SMA_200'], "Buy", "Sell")

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```

This script calculates two simple moving averages (SMA) over different periods (50 days and 200 days). If the 50-day SMA is higher than the 200-day SMA, it means the market trend is upward, so the trading approach is to buy. If the 50-day SMA is lower than the 200-day SMA, it means the market trend is downward, so the trading approach is to sell.

Please note that this is a very simplified trading strategy and doesn't take into account many factors that could influence trading decisions in a real-world scenario. Always consult with a financial advisor or use more sophisticated algorithms for actual trading.
