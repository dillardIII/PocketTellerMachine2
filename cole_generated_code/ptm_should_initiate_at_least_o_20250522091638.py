Sure, here is a simple Python code that uses the `yfinance` library to download stock data and initiate a trade. This is a simulation and doesn't involve real money.

```python
import yfinance as yf

# Define the stock to trade
stock = 'AAPL'

# Download stock data
data = yf.download(stock, start='2021-01-01', end='2021-12-31')

# Define the number of shares to trade
shares = 1

# Define the trade function
def trade(stock, shares):
    # Get the latest price
    price = data['Close'][-1]
    
    # Calculate the cost
    cost = price * shares
    
    print(f'Initiated a trade to buy {shares} shares of {stock} at {price} each. Total cost is {cost}.')

# Initiate a trade
trade(stock, shares)
```

Please note that this is a simple simulation and doesn't involve real money. It also doesn't take into account trading fees or other costs. For real trading, you would need to use a trading API that connects to a brokerage account.
