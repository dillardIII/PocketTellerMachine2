Sure, here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the program will print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume get_backtest_results is a function that returns backtest results
    # for a given strategy
    backtest_results = get_backtest_results(strategy)

    if not backtest_results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Implement your fallback strategy here
        # For now, we just return an empty dictionary
        return {}

    return backtest_results
```

Please note that you will need to replace `get_backtest_results(strategy)` with your actual function or method of obtaining backtest results. The fallback strategy is also currently just an empty dictionary, so you should replace that with whatever your fallback strategy should be.
