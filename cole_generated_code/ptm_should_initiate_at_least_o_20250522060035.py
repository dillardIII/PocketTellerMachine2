Sure, here is an example of Python code that could be used to initiate a trade using the Alpaca API, which is a popular API for stock trading. This is a simple example and doesn't include any logic for deciding when to buy or sell, it just executes a single trade for demonstration purposes.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Define your API key and secret
APCA_API_KEY_ID = 'your_api_key_id'
APCA_API_SECRET_KEY = 'your_api_secret_key'

# Create an API object
api = tradeapi.REST(APCA_API_KEY_ID, APCA_API_SECRET_KEY, base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

Please replace `'your_api_key_id'` and `'your_api_secret_key'` with your actual Alpaca API key and secret. This code will submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock. The 'gtc' time_in_force means the order will remain active until it is filled or cancelled.

Remember, this is a very basic example. In a real trading system, you would want to include logic for deciding when to buy or sell based on market data, and you would want to handle errors and edge cases.
