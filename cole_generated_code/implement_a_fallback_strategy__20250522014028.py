Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs a backtest and returns the results, or `None` if no results are found. If no results are found, the fallback strategy is to run a default backtest.

```python
def fallback_strategy():
    # Run the backtest
    results = run_backtest()

    # Check if results were found
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Running default backtest...")

        # Run a default backtest as a fallback
        results = run_default_backtest()

    # If there are still no results, raise an error
    if results is None:
        raise Exception("No backtest results found, and default backtest failed.")

    return results
```

This is a very basic example. Depending on your specific needs, you might want to add more complex logic, such as retrying the backtest a certain number of times before falling back to the default, or running different default backtests depending on the specific situation.
