In trading, the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) indicates the sum of a particular share over a period of time. It's usually used by traders to identify market trends.

Here's a simple Python code for an EMA Crossover analyzer using the pandas_ datareader to fetch stock data and pandas to calculate the EMA.

This code fetches data from Yahoo Finance and calculates the EMA for 12 and 26 periods. A Buy signal is generated when the 12-period EMA crosses above the 26-period EMA, and a Sell signal is generated when the 12-period EMA dips below the 26-period EMA. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as pdr
from datetime import datetime

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def ema_crossover(stock, start_date, end_date):
    data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(stock, start_date, end_date)
    data['EMA_12'] = calculate_ema(data['Close'], 12)
    data['EMA_26'] = calculate_ema(data['Close'], 26)

    Buy_Signal = (data['EMA_12'] > data['EMA_26'])
    Sell_Signal = (data['EMA_12'] < data['EMA_26'])

    data['Buy_Signal'] = Buy_Signal.shift(1)
    data['Sell_Signal'] = Sell_Signal.shift(1)

    return data

stock = 'AAPL'
start_date = datetime(2020, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime(2021, 12, 31)

df = ema_crossover(stock, start_date, end_date)
print(df)
```

The above code will print the stock data along with the calculated EMA for 12 and 26 periods, as well as the Buy and Sell signal.

**Note:** Please ensure you have the required packages installed in your Python environment with the command `pip install pandas pandas_datareader`.
