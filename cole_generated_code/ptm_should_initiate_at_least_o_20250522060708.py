Sure, I can provide a simple Python code snippet that simulates initiating a trade. However, please note that real trading involves complex algorithms and risk management strategies. This is a very basic example and should not be used for real trading.

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, ticker, volume):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.volume = volume

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []

    def initiate_trade(self, ticker, volume):
        new_trade = Trade(ticker, volume)
        self.trades.append(new_trade)
        print(f"Trade initiated: Bought {volume} of {ticker}")

# Create PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
ptm.initiate_trade("AAPL", 100)
```

In this code, we have a `Trade` class that represents a trade with a ticker symbol and volume. The `PTM` class represents the trading system, which can initiate trades. When a trade is initiated, it's added to the `trades` list and a message is printed.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and a real trading system would be much more complex, including features like fetching real-time prices, executing trades through a broker, managing a portfolio, implementing trading strategies, handling risk management, etc.
