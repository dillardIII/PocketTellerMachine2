Sure, I can provide a simple example of how you might use Python to initiate a trade using an API like Alpaca (a commission-free trading platform). 

Please note that you'll need to replace `'APCA-API-KEY-ID'` and `'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY'` with your actual API keys from Alpaca. Also, this is a very basic example and real trading involves a lot more complexity and risk.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API connection
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Get account information
account = api.get_account()
print(account)

# Check if our account is restricted from trading.
if account.trading_blocked:
    print('Account is currently restricted from trading.')

# Check how much money we have to work with.
print('${} is available as cash'.format(account.cash))

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code will print out some basic account information, check if the account is currently restricted from trading, and then submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading involves a lot more complexity and risk. Always make sure you understand what you're doing before you start trading with real money.
