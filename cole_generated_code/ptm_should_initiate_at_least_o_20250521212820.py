Sure, I'll provide a simple Python code to simulate a trade initiation. Please note that in real-life scenario, trading involves complex algorithms and real-time data.

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, stock, price, volume):
        self.stock = stock
        self.price = price
        self.volume = volume

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # initial balance
        self.portfolio = {}  # stocks owned

    def initiate_trade(self, trade):
        cost = trade.price * trade.volume
        if cost > self.balance:
            print("Not enough balance to initiate the trade.")
            return
        self.balance -= cost
        self.portfolio[trade.stock] = self.portfolio.get(trade.stock, 0) + trade.volume
        print(f"Trade initiated: Bought {trade.volume} of {trade.stock} at {trade.price}")
        print(f"Remaining balance: {self.balance}")

# create PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# create a trade
trade = Trade('AAPL', random.uniform(100, 150), 10)

# initiate trade
ptm.initiate_trade(trade)
```

In this code, we have a `PTM` class that represents the trading system. It has an `initiate_trade` method which takes a `Trade` object as input. The `Trade` object contains information about the stock, price, and volume of the trade. The `initiate_trade` method checks if there is enough balance to complete the trade, if not, it prints an error message. If there is enough balance, it deducts the cost of the trade from the balance, adds the stock to the portfolio, and prints a message indicating the trade was initiated.
