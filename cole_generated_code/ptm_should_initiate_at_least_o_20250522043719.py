Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. In this example, we will use the `yfinance` library to get stock data and `pandas` library to handle the data. We will initiate a trade if the latest closing price is lower than the average closing price in the past 5 days.

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and should not be used in real trading without further enhancements.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

def initiate_trade(stock_symbol):
    # Download historical data as dataframe
    df = yf.download(stock_symbol, period='1mo')

    # Calculate 5 day moving average of the closing prices
    df['5_day_avg'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=5).mean()

    # Get the latest closing price and 5 day average
    latest_close = df['Close'].iloc[-1]
    latest_5_day_avg = df['5_day_avg'].iloc[-1]

    # Initiate a trade if the latest closing price is lower than the 5 day average
    if latest_close < latest_5_day_avg:
        print(f"Initiating a BUY trade for {stock_symbol} at {latest_close}")
        return True
    else:
        print(f"No trade initiated for {stock_symbol}")
        return False

# Test the function
initiate_trade('AAPL')
```

This script will download the last month's data for the given stock symbol (in this case, Apple Inc.), calculate the 5-day moving average of the closing prices, and then initiate a trade if the latest closing price is lower than the average of the last 5 days.

Please remember to install the required libraries by running `pip install yfinance pandas` in your terminal before running the script.
