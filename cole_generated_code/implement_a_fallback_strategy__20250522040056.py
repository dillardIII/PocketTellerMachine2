Sure, here is a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python when no backtest results are found. This example assumes that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that returns the backtest results, and a function called `fallback_strategy()` that you want to run when no backtest results are found.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    # Run the backtest
    results = run_backtest()

    # Check if the results are empty
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")
        results = fallback_strategy()

    return results

def run_backtest():
    # This function should return the results of the backtest
    # For this example, it returns an empty list
    return []

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should return the results of the fallback strategy
    # For this example, it returns a list with a single element
    return ["Fallback result"]

# Get the backtest results
results = get_backtest_results()
print(results)
```

In this example, `run_backtest()` returns an empty list, which triggers the fallback strategy. The `fallback_strategy()` function then returns a list with a single element, which is printed out at the end. You would replace these functions with your actual backtest and fallback strategy functions.
