Sure, I can help you draft a basic Python code for initiating a trade. However, please note that this is a simplified version and actual trading systems are far more complex and require additional security measures.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # Initial balance
        self.stocks = 0  # Initial stocks

    def trade(self):
        # Randomly decide to buy or sell
        action = random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])

        # Randomly decide the quantity to buy or sell
        quantity = random.randint(1, 10)

        # Assume each stock costs $100
        price = 100

        if action == 'buy':
            # Check if we have enough balance to buy
            if self.balance >= price * quantity:
                self.balance -= price * quantity
                self.stocks += quantity
                print(f'Bought {quantity} stocks')
            else:
                print('Not enough balance to buy')
        else:
            # Check if we have enough stocks to sell
            if self.stocks >= quantity:
                self.stocks -= quantity
                self.balance += price * quantity
                print(f'Sold {quantity} stocks')
            else:
                print('Not enough stocks to sell')

        print(f'Current balance: {self.balance}')
        print(f'Current stocks: {self.stocks}')

# Initialize PTM
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
ptm.trade()
```

This code creates a class `PTM` with methods to buy and sell stocks. The `trade` method randomly decides whether to buy or sell and how many stocks to trade. Then it checks if the trade is possible (i.e., if there is enough balance to buy or enough stocks to sell) and performs the trade if it is. After each trade, it prints the current balance and the number of stocks.
