Sure, here is a simple example of how you can implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this example, I'm assuming that the `backtest` function is used to perform the backtest and it returns `None` if no results are found.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest function
    # It should return the backtest results if they are found, and None otherwise
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is your fallback strategy
    # It should be implemented according to your specific needs
    print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy...")

def perform_backtest(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # If backtest results are found, you can process them here
        print("Backtest results found. Processing results...")
```

In this code, `perform_backtest` is the main function that you should call to perform the backtest. It first tries to get the backtest results using the `backtest` function. If no results are found (i.e., `backtest` returns `None`), it calls the `fallback_strategy` function. If results are found, it processes the results (you should replace the print statement with your own code to process the results).
