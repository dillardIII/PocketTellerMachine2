Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty list.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    # This is a placeholder for your actual backtest results retrieval code
    # It should return a list of results, or None if no results were found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results were found. Using fallback strategy.")
    # This is a placeholder for your actual fallback strategy
    # It should return a list of results
    return []

def main():
    backtest_results = get_backtest_results()
    if backtest_results is None:
        backtest_results = fallback_strategy()
    return backtest_results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, the `main` function first tries to get the backtest results. If `get_backtest_results` returns `None`, indicating that no results were found, it then calls the `fallback_strategy` function. The `fallback_strategy` function could be modified to implement whatever fallback behavior you want, such as generating default results, loading results from a backup source, etc.
