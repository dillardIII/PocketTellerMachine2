Here is a simple Python code that simulates a trading scenario. This code doesn't involve real money or real trading, it's just a simulation. 

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self):
        self.win = 0
        self.loss = 0

    def initiate_trade(self):
        # Simulate a trade by generating a random number
        # If the number is even, we win the trade, if it's odd - we lose
        trade_outcome = random.randint(0, 1)
        if trade_outcome == 0:
            self.win += 1
            return "Win"
        else:
            self.loss += 1
            return "Loss"

# Create a PTM (Python Trading Machine)
ptm = Trade()

# Initiate at least one trade
trade_result = ptm.initiate_trade()
print(f"Trade result: {trade_result}")

# Print the total wins and losses
print(f"Total wins: {ptm.win}")
print(f"Total losses: {ptm.loss}")
```

This code creates a `Trade` class that has a method `initiate_trade`. This method simulates a trade by generating a random number. If the number is even, we consider that we won the trade, if it's odd - we lost. The `Trade` class keeps track of the total number of wins and losses. 

Then we create a PTM (Python Trading Machine), which is an instance of the `Trade` class, and initiate at least one trade. After that, we print the result of the trade and the total number of wins and losses.
