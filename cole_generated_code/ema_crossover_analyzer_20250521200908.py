Sure, here's a simple implementation of an EMA Crossover Analyzer using Python and pandas library. This code will analyze the EMA crossover for a given stock data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as web
import datetime as dt

# Define the stock and the period of time you want to analyze
stock = 'AAPL'
start = dt.datetime(2020,1,1)
end = dt.datetime.now()

# Get the stock data
data = web.DataReader(stock, 'yahoo', start, end)

# Calculate the short-term and long-term EMA
short_EMA = data.Close.ewm(span=12, adjust=False).mean()
long_EMA = data.Close.ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()

# Create signals based on the crossover
data['Buy_Signal'] = short_EMA > long_EMA
data['Sell_Signal'] = short_EMA < long_EMA

# Print the data
print(data)
```

This code will print the stock data along with two new columns: 'Buy_Signal' and 'Sell_Signal'. When 'Buy_Signal' is True, it means the short-term EMA is above the long-term EMA, which is a signal to buy. When 'Sell_Signal' is True, it means the short-term EMA is below the long-term EMA, which is a signal to sell.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and might not be suitable for real trading. It's always recommended to use more complex strategies and consider more factors when trading.
