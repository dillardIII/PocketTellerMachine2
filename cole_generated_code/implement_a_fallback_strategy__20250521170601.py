Sure, this can be implemented using exception handling in Python.

Keep in mind, Fallback strategy can differ based on the requirement. Here, I will provide a very basic one:  if there are no backtest results, we will print a statement notifying the same and run an alternative block of code.

Here is a sample Python code for it:

```python
try:
    # Here, you would run your backtest strategy
    res = run_backtest()

    # Check if results are empty
    if not res:
        raise Exception('No backtest results found')
    else:
        # Process your results here
        pass
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    
    # Here, put your fallback strategy code, this will run when no backtest results are found
    fallback_res = run_fallback_strategy()
```

In this example, `run_backtest()` is a function you would replace with your backtest logic, and `run_fallback_strategy()` is the function consisting the fallback strategy. If there are no backtest results, an exception will be raised stating 'No backtest results found'. An except block will handle this exception by running the fallback strategy.
