To analyze market trends and patterns, we can use Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computation, matplotlib for data visualization and sklearn for machine learning. Here is a simple example of how you can use these libraries to analyze stock market data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('stock_market_data.csv')

# Check the first 5 rows of the data
print(data.head())

# Define the predictor variables and the target variable
X = data[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume']]
y = data['Close']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Plot the actual values vs the predicted values
plt.scatter(y_test, predictions)
plt.xlabel('Actual Values')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Values')
plt.title('Market Trends and Patterns')
plt.show()

# Print the model coefficients
print('Coefficients: \n', model.coef_)
```

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world stock market prediction is a complex task that involves many more factors. The accuracy of this model will be very low and it's not recommended to use it for real trading decisions. For more accurate predictions, you should consider using more advanced techniques like time series analysis, sentiment analysis, and deep learning models.
