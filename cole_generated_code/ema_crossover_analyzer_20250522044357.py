Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a simple implementation of an EMA Crossover Analyzer in Python using the pandas library. This script will analyze the EMA crossover for a given stock symbol.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

yf.pdr_override()

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'  # Apple Inc.

# Collect data on this ticker
df = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickerSymbol, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

# Calculate the short-term EMA
ShortEMA = df.Close.ewm(span=12, adjust=False).mean()

# Calculate the long-term EMA
LongEMA = df.Close.ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()

# Create signals based on EMA crossover
df['Buy_Signal'] = pd.DataFrame(np.where(ShortEMA > LongEMA, 1, 0))
df['Sell_Signal'] = pd.DataFrame(np.where(ShortEMA < LongEMA, -1, 0))

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```

This script fetches the historical data for the given ticker symbol (in this case, Apple Inc.) and calculates the short-term and long-term Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). It then generates buy and sell signals based on the crossover of these EMAs. A buy signal is generated when the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA, and a sell signal is generated when the short-term EMA crosses below the long-term EMA.

Please note that you need to install `yfinance` and `pandas_datareader` libraries if they are not installed yet. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install yfinance pandas_datareader
```
