To analyze market trends and patterns, we need to use historical market data. We can use libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization, and sklearn for machine learning. Here is a simple Python code that uses these libraries to analyze market trends and patterns.

Please note that this is a simplified example. In real-world scenarios, you would need to use more sophisticated algorithms and techniques.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load historical market data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Assume the data has columns 'Date' and 'Price'
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Calculate moving average
data['MA'] = data['Price'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Plot the price and moving average
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(data['Price'])
plt.plot(data['MA'])
plt.title('Market Trends')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend(['Price', 'Moving Average'])
plt.show()

# Identify potential trading opportunities
# If the price is above the moving average, it might be a good time to sell
# If the price is below the moving average, it might be a good time to buy
data['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(data['Price'] < data['MA'], 1, 0)
data['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(data['Price'] > data['MA'], 1, 0)

print(data)

# Further, we can use machine learning to predict future prices
X = data['Price'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = data['MA'].values.reshape(-1,1)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the future prices
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Plot the actual prices vs predicted prices
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(y_test, label='Actual Price')
plt.plot(y_pred, label='Predicted Price')
plt.title('Price Prediction')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This code assumes that you have a CSV file named 'market_data.csv' that contains historical market data with 'Date' and 'Price' columns. The 'Date' column contains the dates and the 'Price' column contains the corresponding prices. The code calculates a moving average of the prices, plots the price and moving average, and identifies potential trading opportunities based on the moving average. It also uses a simple linear regression model to predict future prices.
