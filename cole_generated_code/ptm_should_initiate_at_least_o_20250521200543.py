Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trading algorithm. This code will initiate at least one trade and calculate the potential wins or losses based on the random price movement.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and involve sophisticated strategies and risk management techniques.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.funds = 10000  # Initial funds
        self.position = 0  # Current position
        self.price = 100  # Initial price

    def trade(self):
        # Randomly decide to buy or sell
        action = random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])

        # Randomly decide the quantity to trade
        quantity = random.randint(1, 10)

        if action == 'buy':
            # Can't buy if not enough funds
            if self.price * quantity > self.funds:
                print("Not enough funds to buy")
                return

            self.position += quantity
            self.funds -= self.price * quantity
            print(f"Bought {quantity} at {self.price}, remaining funds: {self.funds}")

        elif action == 'sell':
            # Can't sell if not enough position
            if quantity > self.position:
                print("Not enough position to sell")
                return

            self.position -= quantity
            self.funds += self.price * quantity
            print(f"Sold {quantity} at {self.price}, remaining funds: {self.funds}")

    def simulate(self):
        # Randomly move the price
        self.price += random.randint(-10, 10)

        # Initiate a trade
        self.trade()

        # Calculate potential wins or losses
        potential_wins_losses = self.position * self.price - self.funds
        print(f"Potential wins/losses: {potential_wins_losses}")

ptm = PTM()
ptm.simulate()
```

This code creates a PTM (Portfolio Trading Model) with initial funds of 10000 and an initial price of 100. The `simulate` method randomly moves the price, initiates a trade, and calculates the potential wins or losses. The `trade` method randomly decides to buy or sell and the quantity to trade.
