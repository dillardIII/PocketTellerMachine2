Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs a backtest and returns the results, or `None` if no results are found.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your fallback strategy here
    print("Running fallback strategy...")

def main():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")
        # Process your results here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` is called and its results are stored in `results`. If `results` is `None` (indicating that no backtest results were found), the fallback strategy is executed. Otherwise, the code proceeds as normal.

Please replace the `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` functions with your own implementation.
