Sure, here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function named `run_backtest()` which runs the backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, it will run a fallback strategy, which in this case is simply printing a message and could be replaced with any other fallback action.

```python
def run_fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")

def main():
    backtest_results = run_backtest()

    if not backtest_results:
        run_fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please replace `run_backtest()` and `run_fallback_strategy()` with your actual functions. This is just a simple example and might need to be adjusted based on your actual requirements and the structure of your code.
