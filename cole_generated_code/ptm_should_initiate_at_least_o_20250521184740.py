Sure, I can provide a simple example of how you might initiate a trade using Python. This example will use the `alpaca_trade_api` package, which is a simple interface to the Alpaca API, a platform for algorithmic trading.

First, you need to install the package using pip:

```python
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Then, you can use the following code to initiate a trade:

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Define the symbol and quantity
symbol = 'AAPL'
qty = 1

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (AAPL)
order = api.submit_order(
    symbol=symbol,
    qty=qty,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)

print(f"Submitted order to buy {qty} share(s) of {symbol}")
```

Please replace `<APCA-API-KEY-ID>` and `<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>` with your actual Alpaca API key ID and secret key. 

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock at the current market price. After the trade is initiated, you can evaluate the effectiveness of your current strategies by analyzing the performance of this trade.

Please note that this is a very basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would likely want to use more complex strategies and take into account various factors such as the current market conditions, the performance of the stock in the past, etc.
