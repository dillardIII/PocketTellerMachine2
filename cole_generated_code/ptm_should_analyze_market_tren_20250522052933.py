To analyze market trends and identify potential trading opportunities, we can use Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download stock price data, and matplotlib for visualization. Here's a simple Python script that uses moving average crossover strategy to identify potential trading opportunities:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = "AAPL"
ticker_data = yf.download(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

# Calculate moving averages
short_rolling = ticker_data.rolling(window=20).mean()
long_rolling = ticker_data.rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create signals
signals = pd.DataFrame(index=ticker_data.index)
signals['signal'] = 0.0
signals['short_mavg'] = short_rolling['Close']
signals['long_mavg'] = long_rolling['Close']
signals['signal'][short_rolling['Close'] > long_rolling['Close']] = 1.0

# Generate trading orders
signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

# Print potential trading opportunities
print(signals[signals['positions'] != 0])

# Plot
fig = plt.figure()
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111, ylabel='Price in $')
ticker_data['Close'].plot(ax=ax1, color='r', lw=2.)
signals[['short_mavg', 'long_mavg']].plot(ax=ax1, lw=2.)
ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == 1.0].index, signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == 1.0], '^', markersize=10, color='m')
ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == -1.0].index, signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == -1.0], 'v', markersize=10, color='k')
plt.show()
```

This script downloads historical price data for the Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, calculates 20-day and 100-day moving averages, and generates trading signals based on the crossover of these moving averages. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it generates a buy signal, and when it crosses below, it generates a sell signal. These potential trading opportunities are then printed and plotted on a graph.

Please note that this is a very basic form of market trend analysis and real-world trading strategies would be much more complex, taking into account many other factors. Also, this script assumes that you have the necessary Python libraries installed and that you have an internet connection to download the data.
