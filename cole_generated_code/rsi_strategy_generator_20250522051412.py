Sure, here is a simple implementation of a Relative Strength Index (RSI) strategy generator in Python using the `pandas` and `yfinance` libraries. This strategy will generate a buy signal when the RSI is below 30 (oversold) and a sell signal when the RSI is above 70 (overbought).

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

yf.pdr_override()

# Function to calculate RSI
def calculate_rsi(data, window):
    delta = data.diff()
    up, down = delta.copy(), delta.copy()
    up[up < 0] = 0
    down[down > 0] = 0

    average_gain = up.rolling(window).mean()
    average_loss = abs(down.rolling(window).mean())

    rs = average_gain / average_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi

# Fetch data
data = pdr.get_data_yahoo("AAPL", start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

# Calculate RSI
data['RSI'] = calculate_rsi(data['Adj Close'], 14)

# Generate signals
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['RSI'] < 30)
data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['RSI'] > 70)

print(data)
```

This code fetches historical data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance, calculates the 14-day RSI, and generates buy and sell signals based on the RSI values. The `Buy_Signal` column will be `True` on days where the RSI is below 30, and the `Sell_Signal` column will be `True` on days where the RSI is above 70. These signals could be used as part of a trading strategy.
