Sure, here is a simple example of how you might initiate trades using Python. In this example, I will use the `yfinance` library to download stock data and `backtrader` for backtesting trading strategies.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading involves many more factors like handling transaction costs, slippage, risk management etc.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import backtrader as bt

# Define a simple moving average crossover strategy
class SmaCross(bt.Strategy):
    params = (('pfast', 10), ('pslow', 30),)

    def __init__(self):
        sma1 = bt.ind.SMA(period=self.p.pfast)
        sma2 = bt.ind.SMA(period=self.p.pslow)
        self.crossover = bt.ind.CrossOver(sma1, sma2)

    def next(self):
        if not self.position:
            if self.crossover > 0:
                self.buy()
        elif self.crossover < 0:
            self.close()

# Download historical data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')
data = bt.feeds.PandasData(dataname=data)

# Create a backtester
cerebro = bt.Cerebro()

# Add the strategy
cerebro.addstrategy(SmaCross)

# Add the data
cerebro.adddata(data)

# Run the backtester
cerebro.run()

# Plot the result
cerebro.plot()
```

This script will backtest a simple moving average crossover strategy on AAPL stock data from 2020 to 2022. When the fast moving average crosses above the slow moving average, it will initiate a buy trade. When the fast moving average crosses below the slow moving average, it will close the trade.

Please make sure to install the required libraries by running `pip install yfinance backtrader` in your terminal.

Also, please remember that trading involves risk and this code should be used for educational purposes only. Always do your own research before initiating any trades.
