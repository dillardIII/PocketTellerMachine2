To develop a trading strategy, we would need to have a dataset of historical trading data. However, since you didn't provide any specific data, I'll provide a simple example of a Python trading strategy using the Moving Average Crossover strategy. This strategy is one of the most commonly used strategies in trading. It uses two moving averages: one short-term and one long-term. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it indicates a buy signal. Conversely, when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, it indicates a sell signal.

Here is a simple Python code using `pandas` for data manipulation and `yfinance` to download historical stock data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
data = yf.download('AAPL','2020-01-01','2022-01-01')

# Calculate short-term and long-term moving averages
data['Short_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['Long_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create signals based on crossover strategy
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['Short_MA'] > data['Long_MA']).astype(int)
data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['Short_MA'] < data['Long_MA']).astype(int)

# Print data
print(data)
```

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and might not be profitable in real trading. It's always recommended to use more sophisticated strategies and risk management techniques when trading in real markets. Also, this code does not include transaction costs, which can significantly impact the performance of the strategy.
