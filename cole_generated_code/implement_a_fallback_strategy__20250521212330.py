Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the function will return a message indicating that no results were found and the fallback strategy was used.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Run backtest
    backtest_results = strategy.run_backtest()

    # Check if backtest results are empty
    if not backtest_results:
        # Fallback strategy
        print("No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy.")
        fallback_results = strategy.run_fallback()
        return fallback_results

    return backtest_results

class Strategy:
    def run_backtest(self):
        # Code to run backtest
        # This is just a placeholder, replace with actual code
        return {}

    def run_fallback(self):
        # Code to run fallback strategy
        # This is just a placeholder, replace with actual code
        return {"fallback": True}

strategy = Strategy()
print(backtest_strategy(strategy))
```

In this code, `run_backtest` and `run_fallback` are placeholder methods. You would replace these with your actual methods for running the backtest and the fallback strategy. The `Strategy` class is also a placeholder, you would replace this with your actual strategy class.
