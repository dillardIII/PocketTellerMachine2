Analyzing market trends and data to make informed trading decisions involves complex algorithms and machine learning models. However, I can provide a simple example of how you can analyze stock prices using Python.

Here's a simple Python code using pandas and yfinance libraries to fetch historical stock data and analyze it:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL','2020-01-01','2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving average
data['MA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(50).mean()
data['MA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(200).mean()

# Plot the close price and moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price')
plt.plot(data['MA_50'], label='50-day Moving Average')
plt.plot(data['MA_200'], label='200-day Moving Average')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.title('Apple Stock Price')
plt.show()
```

This code fetches historical data for Apple's stock, calculates the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and plots them. The moving averages are commonly used indicators for trend following trading strategies. 

Please note that this is a very basic example. Real-world trading decisions would require much more complex analysis, taking into account many other factors and possibly using machine learning algorithms. It's also important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results in stock trading.
