Sure, here is a simple example of a Python code that uses the Alpaca Trade API to initiate a trade. Please replace the placeholders with your actual API keys.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# API keys
API_KEY = '<Your-API-Key>'
SECRET_KEY = '<Your-Secret-Key>'
BASE_URL = 'https://paper-api.alpaca.markets'  # Use paper trading URL

# Initialize API
api = tradeapi.REST(API_KEY, SECRET_KEY, base_url=BASE_URL)

# Define the stock to trade and the number of shares
symbol = 'AAPL'
qty = 1

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (AAPL)
order = api.submit_order(
    symbol=symbol,
    qty=qty,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)

print(f"Submitted market order to buy {qty} share(s) of {symbol}")
```

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock. The trade is submitted as a market order with 'good till cancelled' (gtc) time in force, which means the order will remain active until it is filled or cancelled.

Please note that this is a very basic example. In a real trading scenario, you would likely need to implement additional logic to handle things like checking your account balance, managing risk, and handling trade execution errors. Also, remember to handle your API keys securely and never share them with anyone.

Before running this code, you need to install the `alpaca-trade-api` Python package. You can install it via pip:

```
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Also, please note that this code is for educational purposes only and should not be used for real trading without proper knowledge and understanding of the potential risks.
