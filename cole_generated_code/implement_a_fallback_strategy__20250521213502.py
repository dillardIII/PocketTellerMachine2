Sure, here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, I'm assuming that the backtest function returns None when no results are found. The fallback strategy could be anything, but for this example, I'm just printing a message and returning an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your actual backtest function
    # It should return the backtest results if they exist, or None if they don't
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Applying fallback strategy...")
    # Implement your fallback strategy here
    return {}

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        results = fallback_strategy()
    return results
```

You would use the `execute_strategy` function to run your strategy and automatically apply the fallback strategy if no backtest results are found. You need to replace the `backtest` and `fallback_strategy` functions with your actual implementation.
