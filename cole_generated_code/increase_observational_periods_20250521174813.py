Implementing this task as a Python application will involve designing a system to process real-time data and increase observational periods during peak trading times.

Here's a simplified concept of how it can be done:

```python
import datetime
import time

class TradingAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.start_peak_hours = 9
        self.end_peak_hours = 16

    def is_peak_trading_time(self):
        current_hour = datetime.datetime.now().hour

        if current_hour >= self.start_peak_hours and current_hour <= self.end_peak_hours:
            return True
        else:
            return False

    def observe_market(self):
        while True:
            if self.is_peak_trading_time():
                self.increase_observation() 
            time.sleep(60) # Check every minute - this can be adjusted

    def increase_observation(self):
        # Implement the methods to observe the market more closely,
        # this could be increasing the frequency of data fetching, applying
        # different algorithms to catch possible wins, etc.
        pass
```

Please note - the logic of the `increase_observation` function depends on the exact trading operations of Cole. Current Python code increases observation frequency during peak trading hours which are set as variables `start_peak_hours` and `end_peak_hours`.
