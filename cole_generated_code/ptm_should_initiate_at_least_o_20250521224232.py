To initiate a trade, we can use a trading API such as Alpaca. Here is a simple example of how to initiate a trade using Alpaca's API in Python:

First, install the Alpaca API:
```python
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Then, use the following code to initiate a trade:

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

Please replace `<APCA-API-KEY-ID>` and `<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>` with your actual API keys.

This code will submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock. The 'gtc' time_in_force means the order will stay open until it is either filled or cancelled.

Please note that this code will only work if you have a funded Alpaca account and the market is currently open. Also, it's important to remember that trading involves risk, and this should not be done without proper understanding of the market.
