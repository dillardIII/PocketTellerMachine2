Sure, I can provide you with a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic trading strategy using Moving Average Crossover. This strategy is a popular one where you maintain a short-term and long-term moving average, and place trades based on when these averages cross each other.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading strategies can be much more complex and require careful consideration of various factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickerSymbol, start='2019-07-01', end='2022-07-01')

# Calculate moving averages
short_rolling = tickerData.rolling(window=20).mean()
long_rolling = tickerData.rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create signals
signals = pd.DataFrame(index=tickerData.index)
signals['signal'] = 0.0
signals['short_mavg'] = short_rolling['Close']
signals['long_mavg'] = long_rolling['Close']
signals['signal'][short_rolling['Close'] > long_rolling['Close']] = 1.0

# Generate trading orders
signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

# Print the dataframe
print(signals)

# Plotting
fig = plt.figure()
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111, ylabel='Price in $')
short_rolling['Close'].plot(ax=ax1, color='r', lw=2.)
long_rolling['Close'].plot(ax=ax1, color='b', lw=2.)
ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == 1.0].index, 
         signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == 1.0],
         '^', markersize=10, color='m')
ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == -1.0].index, 
         signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == -1.0],
         'v', markersize=10, color='k')
plt.show()
```

This script fetches historical data for a specific ticker (in this case, Apple Inc.), calculates the short-term (20 days) and long-term (100 days) moving averages, generates trading signals based on the crossover of these averages, and plots the results.

Please install necessary libraries by using pip:
```
pip install pandas pandas_datareader matplotlib
```

Remember, this is a very simple strategy and may not be profitable in real trading. Always backtest your strategies before live trading.
