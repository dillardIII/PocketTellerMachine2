Analyzing market trends and data to identify potential profitable trades involves complex algorithms and requires a lot of data. Here is a simple example of how you might start to do this using Python and the pandas library to analyze stock prices. 

This script will fetch historical stock data using the `yfinance` library, calculate the moving average, and plot the data. The moving average is a common indicator used in technical analysis to identify trends.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Fetch historical market data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving average
data['MA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(50).mean()
data['MA200'] = data['Close'].rolling(200).mean()

# Plot data
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.grid(True)
plt.plot(data['Close'],label='Close')
plt.plot(data['MA50'], label='MA 50 Days')
plt.plot(data['MA200'], label='MA 200 Days')
plt.legend(loc=2)

plt.show()
```

This is a very basic example and real trading algorithms are much more complex, taking into account many more factors and using advanced statistical methods.
