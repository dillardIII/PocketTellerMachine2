To analyze market trends, we'll need to use some sort of data analysis library. In Python, the most common one for this kind of task is `pandas`. We'll also use `yfinance` to download stock data, `numpy` for some calculations and `matplotlib` for plotting. Here is a simple example of how you might analyze market trends:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# Calculate the moving average
tickerDf['MA_50'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
tickerDf['MA_200'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Plot everything by leveraging the very powerful matplotlib package
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(tickerDf['Close'],label=tickerSymbol)
plt.plot(tickerDf['MA_50'],label='MA 50 day')
plt.plot(tickerDf['MA_200'],label='MA 200 day')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Identify potential trading opportunities for tomorrow
# A common strategy is to buy when the 50-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average
buy_signals = tickerDf['MA_50'] > tickerDf['MA_200']

if buy_signals.iloc[-1]:
    print("Potential trading opportunity for tomorrow: BUY")
else:
    print("Potential trading opportunity for tomorrow: SELL")
```

Please note that this is a very basic example of market trend analysis. Real world trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors. Also, this script assumes that you have `yfinance`, `pandas`, `numpy` and `matplotlib` installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib
```
