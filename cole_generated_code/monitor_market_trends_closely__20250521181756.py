Creating a full-fledged trading algorithm requires quite a bit of coding for data acquisition, scenarios handling, data analysis, and execution of trades which goes beyond the scope of this platform. However, I can provide Python code that utilizes the `yfinance` library to obtain and visualize stock data which can be used for basic monitoring of market trends.

Please note that this is a basic example and shouldn't be treated as a full done-for-you trading assistant.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters
register_matplotlib_converters()

def get_stock_data(ticker_symbol, period='1y'):
    ticker = yf.Ticker(ticker_symbol)
    df = ticker.history(period=period)
    return df

def plot_stock_data(ticker_symbol, df):
    plt.figure(figsize=(14,7))
    plt.title(f'{ticker_symbol} Stock Price over {df.index[0]} to {df.index[-1]}')
    plt.plot(df['Close'])
    plt.xlabel('Date', fontsize=14)
    plt.ylabel('Closing Price (USD)', fontsize=14)
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

ticker_symbol = 'AAPL'  # in this case, you're looking at Apple
df = get_stock_data(ticker_symbol)
plot_stock_data(ticker_symbol, df)
```

In this code, `get_stock_data` function is used to download the historical stock data for a given ticker symbol. The `period` parameter can be modified to set the duration for which the data is to be downloaded.

The `plot_stock_data` function is used to visualize the closing prices of the stock over the defined period.

You can monitor possible market trends by observing changes in the closing prices.

This example uses Apple stock ('AAPL') as an example. You can replace 'AAPL' with the symbol of any stock you're interested in.

Remember, in order to run this code you need to have the `yfinance` library installed in your Python environment. You can install it with pip using the following command: `pip install yfinance`.

Please note this is a simple example and not a recommendation for trading system. Trading in markets is risky and you should consult financial advisors before taking any decisions.
