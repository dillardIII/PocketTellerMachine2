Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is simply to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    # This is a placeholder for the actual code that fetches backtest results
    # In a real-world scenario, this would likely involve querying a database or an API
    results = {}

    # Check if the results are empty
    if not results:
        # Fallback strategy: print a message and return an empty dictionary
        print("No backtest results found. Falling back to default strategy.")
        return {}

    # If results were found, return them
    return results

# Test the function
print(get_backtest_results())
```

In this code, the `get_backtest_results` function is supposed to fetch backtest results (from a database, an API, etc.). If no results are found (i.e., if `results` is an empty dictionary), it prints a message and returns an empty dictionary as a fallback. If results are found, it returns them.

Please replace the `results = {}` line with the actual code that fetches backtest results in your application.
