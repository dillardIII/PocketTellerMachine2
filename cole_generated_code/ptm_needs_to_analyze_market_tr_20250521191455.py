To analyze market trends and patterns, we can use Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computation, and matplotlib for data visualization. Also, we will use yfinance to download the historical market data from Yahoo finance.

Here is a basic example of how you can do it:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = "AAPL"
tickerData = yf.Ticker(ticker)
df = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
df['MA10'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
df['MA50'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a function to signal when to buy and sell an asset
def buy_sell(signal):
    Buy = []
    Sell = []
    flag = -1

    for i in range(len(signal)):
        if signal['MA10'][i] > signal['MA50'][i]:
            Sell.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 1:
                Buy.append(signal['Close'][i])
                flag = 1
            else:
                Buy.append(np.nan)
        elif signal['MA10'][i] < signal['MA50'][i]:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 0:
                Sell.append(signal['Close'][i])
                flag = 0
            else:
                Sell.append(np.nan)
        else:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            Sell.append(np.nan)

    return (Buy, Sell)

# Create buy and sell column
df['Buy_Signal_Price'] = buy_sell(df)[0]
df['Sell_Signal_Price'] = buy_sell(df)[1]

# Plot data
plt.figure(figsize=(12.5, 4.5))
plt.plot(df['Close'], label='Close Price', alpha=0.35)
plt.plot(df['MA10'], label='MA10', alpha=0.35)
plt.plot(df['MA50'], label='MA50', alpha=0.35)
plt.scatter(df.index, df['Buy_Signal_Price'], color='green', label='Buy Signal', marker='^', alpha=1)
plt.scatter(df.index, df['Sell_Signal_Price'], color='red', label='Sell Signal', marker='v', alpha=1)
plt.title('Close Price Buy & Sell Signals')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Close Price USD ($)')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```

This script downloads the historical data for the Apple stock, calculates the 10-day and 50-day moving averages, and generates buy and sell signals based on these averages. The script then plots the close price, moving averages, and buy/sell signals.

Please note that this is a very basic form of analysis and doesn't take into account many factors that could influence the profitability of trades. For more advanced analysis, you might want to consider machine learning or other forms of AI.
