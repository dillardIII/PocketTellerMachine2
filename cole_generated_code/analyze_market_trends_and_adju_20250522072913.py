Analyzing market trends and adjusting trading parameters is a complex task that involves machine learning, statistical analysis, and financial knowledge. Here is a simplified example of how you might approach this in Python using pandas for data manipulation and sklearn for machine learning.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load market data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Define features and target
features = data.drop('Target', axis=1)
target = data['Target']

# Split data into training and test sets
features_train, features_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(features_train, target_train)

# Predict the market trend
predictions = model.predict(features_test)

# Adjust trading parameters based on the predictions
# This is a simplified example, in a real-world scenario, you would need a more sophisticated strategy
trading_parameters = {}

if predictions.mean() > 0:
    trading_parameters['buy'] = True
else:
    trading_parameters['sell'] = True

print(trading_parameters)
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider many more factors, such as transaction costs, market volatility, the specific assets you are trading, etc. You would also likely use a more sophisticated machine learning model, and you would need to regularly retrain your model as new data becomes available.
