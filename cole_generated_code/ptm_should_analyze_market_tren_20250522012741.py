To analyze market trends and identify potential winning trades, we can use Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download stock price data, and matplotlib to visualize the data. Here is a simple Python script that uses moving average strategy to identify potential winning trades:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
def download_data(stock, start_date, end_date):
    data = {}
    ticker = yf.download(stock, start_date, end_date)
    data['Price'] = ticker['Adj Close']
    return pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate moving averages
def calculate_moving_averages(data, short_window, long_window):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['Price'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['Price'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()
    return signals

# Plot data
def plot_data(data, signals):
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111, ylabel='Price in $')
    data['Price'].plot(ax=ax1, color='r', lw=2.)
    signals[['short_mavg', 'long_mavg']].plot(ax=ax1, lw=2.)
    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == 1.0].index, signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == 1.0], '^' , markersize=10, color='m')
    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == -1.0].index, signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == -1.0], 'v' , markersize=10, color='k')
    plt.show()

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data for the specified period
data = download_data(tickerSymbol, '2010-01-01', '2020-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
short_window = 40
long_window = 100
signals = calculate_moving_averages(data, short_window, long_window)

# Plot data
plot_data(data, signals)
```

In this script, we first download the historical data for the desired ticker symbol. Then, we calculate the short-term (40 days) and long-term (100 days) moving averages. A buy signal is generated when the short-term average crosses above the long-term average, and a sell signal is generated when the short-term average crosses below the long-term average. Finally, we plot the price data and the moving averages, with buy signals represented by up arrows and sell signals represented by down arrows.

Please note that this is a very simplistic trading strategy and should not be used for actual trading without further enhancements.
