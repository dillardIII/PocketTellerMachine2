Sure, here's a simple implementation of a Relative Strength Index (RSI) strategy generator in Python using the `pandas` and `yfinance` libraries. This code will download historical data for a specific stock, calculate the RSI, and generate a simple trading strategy based on the RSI.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_rsi(data, window):
    delta = data.diff()
    up, down = delta.copy(), delta.copy()
    up[up < 0] = 0
    down[down > 0] = 0

    average_gain = up.rolling(window=window).mean()
    average_loss = abs(down.rolling(window=window).mean())

    rs = average_gain / average_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi

def generate_rsi_strategy(ticker, rsi_window, rsi_upper, rsi_lower):
    data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')
    data['RSI'] = calculate_rsi(data['Close'], rsi_window)
    
    data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['RSI'] < rsi_lower)
    data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['RSI'] > rsi_upper)
    
    return data

# Example usage:
df = generate_rsi_strategy('AAPL', 14, 70, 30)
print(df)
```

In this code, `generate_rsi_strategy` function downloads historical data for a given ticker symbol, calculates the RSI with a specified window size, and generates a trading strategy. The strategy is to buy when the RSI goes below a lower threshold (indicating the stock is oversold) and to sell when the RSI goes above an upper threshold (indicating the stock is overbought).

Please note that this is a very simplistic strategy and doesn't take into account many factors that could influence the success of a trading strategy. Always do your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making trading decisions.
