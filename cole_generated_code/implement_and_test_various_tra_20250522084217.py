Sure, I'll provide a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic trading strategy using Moving Average Crossover. This strategy is one of the most commonly used strategies in trading. It involves two moving averages, one short term and one long term. When the short term moving average crosses above the long term moving average, it is a signal to buy. When it crosses below, it is a signal to sell.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world trading strategies can be much more complex and involve many other factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas_datareader import data as web

# Define the stock to be used in this case
stock = 'AAPL'

# Define the data range
start_date = '01/01/2010'
end_date = '01/01/2022'

# Get the stock data
df = web.DataReader(stock, 'yahoo', start_date, end_date)

# Calculate the short term and long term moving averages
short_term_avg = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
long_term_avg = df['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create signals based on the crossover
df['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(short_term_avg > long_term_avg, 1, 0)
df['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(short_term_avg < long_term_avg, -1, 0)

# Plot the stock price and the moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
plt.plot(df['Close'], label=stock)
plt.plot(short_term_avg, label='Short term average')
plt.plot(long_term_avg, label='Long term average')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.show()

# Print the signals
print(df)
```

This code will print the stock's closing price, the short term average, the long term average, and the buy/sell signals. It will also plot these values for visual analysis.

Please note that you need to install the `pandas_datareader` library to fetch the stock data. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install pandas-datareader
```

Also, this is a very basic strategy and may not be profitable in real trading. Always backtest your strategies before using them in live trading.
