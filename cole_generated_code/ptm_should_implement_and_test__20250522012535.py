Sure, I can provide a basic example of a simple trading strategy using Python. This example will use a simple Moving Average Crossover strategy. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading strategies are much more complex and involve much more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    sma = data.rolling(window=window).mean()
    return sma

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    ema = data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()
    return ema

def implement_strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    # Calculate the short and long window simple moving averages
    data['short_sma'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], short_window)
    data['long_sma'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], long_window)

    # Create signals based on the crossover of the short and long SMA
    data['signal'] = 0.0
    data['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(data['short_sma'][short_window:] 
                                            > data['long_sma'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)
   
    # Generate trading orders based on the signals
    data['positions'] = data['signal'].diff()

    return data

# Fetch the data
data = web.DataReader('AAPL', data_source='yahoo', start='01-01-2010', end='01-01-2022')

# Implement the strategy
implement_strategy(data, 50, 200)

# Print the DataFrame
print(data)
```

This script fetches historical price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance, calculates the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA), generates trading signals based on the crossover of these SMAs, and generates trading orders based on these signals.

Please note that this is a very simple trading strategy and is not guaranteed to be profitable. It's always recommended to backtest any strategy thoroughly before live trading. Also, this script does not take into account trading fees or slippage.
