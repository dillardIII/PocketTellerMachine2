In order to analyze market trends and opportunities for potential trades, we need to fetch market data first. We can use the `yfinance` library in Python to fetch the stock market data. Then we can use `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib` for data visualization.

Here is a simple example of how you can analyze market trends for a particular stock (e.g., 'AAPL'):

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters
register_matplotlib_converters()

# Fetch data
data = yf.download('AAPL','2020-01-01','2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving average
data['MA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['MA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Plot data
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.grid(True)
plt.plot(data['Close'],label='AAPL')
plt.plot(data['MA_50'], label='MA 50 day')
plt.plot(data['MA_200'], label='MA 200 day')
plt.legend(loc=2)
plt.show()
```

In this code, we are fetching the historical data for 'AAPL' stock from 2020 to 2022. Then we are calculating the moving average for the last 50 days and 200 days. The moving average is a common indicator used in trend analysis. Finally, we are plotting the closing price and the moving averages.

Please note that this is a very basic form of trend analysis and real-world trading algorithms use much more complex strategies and indicators. Also, this code assumes that you have the `yfinance`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` libraries installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas matplotlib
```
