Here is a simple Python code that simulates trading for PTM. The code uses random function to simulate the unpredictability of the stock market. 

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance=1000):
        self.balance = initial_balance
        self.experience = 0

    def trade(self):
        # Randomly decide whether this is a winning or losing trade
        win = random.choice([True, False])

        # Randomly decide how much money is involved in the trade
        trade_value = random.randint(1, 100)

        if win:
            self.balance += trade_value
        else:
            self.balance -= trade_value

        # Increase experience after each trade
        self.experience += 1

        return win, trade_value

# Create a PTM
ptm = PTM()

# Let PTM trade for 100 times
for _ in range(100):
    win, trade_value = ptm.trade()
    print(f"Trade #{ptm.experience}: {'Win' if win else 'Loss'} ${trade_value}, Balance: ${ptm.balance}")
```

In this code, PTM starts with an initial balance of 1000. It then makes 100 trades. For each trade, it randomly decides whether it's a winning or losing trade and how much money is involved in the trade. After each trade, PTM's experience increases by 1. The result of each trade and the current balance are printed out.
