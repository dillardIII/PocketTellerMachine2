Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code for a trading strategy. However, please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading strategies are much more complex and require a deep understanding of financial markets.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

# Define the stocks to be used in the portfolio
stocks = ['AAPL', 'GOOG', 'MSFT', 'AMZN']

# Define the start and end dates for the data
start_date = '01/01/2010'
end_date = '31/12/2020'

# Fetch the data from Yahoo Finance
data = pd.DataFrame()
for stock in stocks:
    data[stock] = web.DataReader(stock, data_source='yahoo', start=start_date, end=end_date)['Adj Close']

# Calculate the log returns, which is often used in finance
log_returns = np.log(data / data.shift(1))

# Define the weights of the stocks in the portfolio
weights = np.array([0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25])

# Calculate the portfolio returns
portfolio_returns = log_returns.mean() * 252 * weights

# Calculate the portfolio variance
portfolio_variance = np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(log_returns.cov() * 252, weights))

# Calculate the portfolio volatility
portfolio_volatility = np.sqrt(portfolio_variance)

# Print the portfolio returns, variance and volatility
print("Expected Portfolio Return: ", portfolio_returns)
print("Expected Portfolio Variance: ", portfolio_variance)
print("Expected Portfolio Volatility: ", portfolio_volatility)
```

This code fetches the historical data for the stocks, calculates the log returns, and then calculates the expected portfolio return, variance, and volatility based on the weights of the stocks in the portfolio.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and does not take into account many factors that should be considered in real-world trading, such as transaction costs, market impact, risk management, etc. Also, using historical data to predict future performance has its limitations and risks.
