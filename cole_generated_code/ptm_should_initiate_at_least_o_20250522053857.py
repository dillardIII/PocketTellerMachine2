To initiate a trade and gather data on wins or losses, you would first need to have a trading algorithm or strategy in place. However, I can give you a simple example of how you might structure your Python code to initiate a trade and record the outcome.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and does not take into account many factors that you would need to consider in a real trading scenario, such as fees, slippage, and market impact.

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, symbol, quantity, entry_price, exit_price):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.entry_price = entry_price
        self.exit_price = exit_price

    def profit_or_loss(self):
        return (self.exit_price - self.entry_price) * self.quantity

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []
        self.wins = 0
        self.losses = 0

    def initiate_trade(self, symbol, quantity, entry_price):
        # This is a very simplified example. In a real scenario, you would need to determine the exit price based on your trading strategy.
        exit_price = random.uniform(entry_price - 10, entry_price + 10)
        trade = Trade(symbol, quantity, entry_price, exit_price)
        self.trades.append(trade)

        if trade.profit_or_loss() > 0:
            self.wins += 1
        else:
            self.losses += 1

ptm = PTM()
ptm.initiate_trade('AAPL', 100, 150)
print(f'Wins: {ptm.wins}, Losses: {ptm.losses}')
```

In this example, the `PTM` class represents a simple trading system. It has a method `initiate_trade` that creates a `Trade` object and adds it to the list of trades. It then checks whether the trade was a win or a loss and updates the corresponding counter. The `Trade` class represents a single trade and has a method `profit_or_loss` that calculates the profit or loss from the trade.
