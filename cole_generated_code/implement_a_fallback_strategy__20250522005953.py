Sure, here is a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, we will try to run a backtest and if no results are found, we will instead return a simple message.

```python
def run_backtest(strategy):
    """
    This is a placeholder for your backtest function. 
    It should return the results of the backtest.
    """
    # Implement your backtest here
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    """
    This is a placeholder for your fallback strategy. 
    It should return the results of the fallback strategy.
    """
    # Implement your fallback strategy here
    return "No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy."

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    """
    This function attempts to run a backtest on a given strategy. 
    If no results are found, it runs a fallback strategy.
    """
    try:
        results = run_backtest(strategy)
        if not results:
            return fallback_strategy()
        return results
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return fallback_strategy()

# Test the function with a strategy
print(execute_strategy("my_strategy"))
```

This is a very basic example and your actual implementation will depend on how your backtest and fallback functions are implemented.
