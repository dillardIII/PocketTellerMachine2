Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. In this example, I will use a simple print statement as the fallback strategy, but you can replace it with any suitable action as per your requirements.

```python
def backtest(trading_strategy):
    # Assuming this function performs backtest and returns the result
    # This is just a placeholder. Replace it with actual implementation
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy.")
    # Add your fallback strategy here

def execute_strategy(trading_strategy):
    backtest_result = backtest(trading_strategy)
    
    if backtest_result is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest result: ", backtest_result)

# Execute the strategy
execute_strategy("Your trading strategy")
```

In this code, `execute_strategy` function is the main function that executes a trading strategy. It first performs a backtest by calling `backtest` function. If the backtest result is `None` (which means no backtest results were found), it executes the fallback strategy by calling `fallback_strategy` function. Otherwise, it prints the backtest result. 

Please replace `"Your trading strategy"` with your actual trading strategy and implement `backtest` and `fallback_strategy` functions as per your requirements.
