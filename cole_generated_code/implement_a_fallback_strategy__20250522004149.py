Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the program will print a message and then execute the fallback strategy.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest function
    # It should return a boolean indicating whether the backtest was successful
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your fallback strategy
    # It should be a different strategy that you can use if the backtest fails
    pass

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    backtest_results = backtest_strategy(strategy)

    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # If backtest results are found, continue with your original strategy
        pass

# Execute the strategy
execute_strategy(my_strategy)
```

Please replace `backtest_strategy`, `fallback_strategy`, and `my_strategy` with your actual functions and strategy. This is just a basic example and might need to be adjusted based on your specific use case.
