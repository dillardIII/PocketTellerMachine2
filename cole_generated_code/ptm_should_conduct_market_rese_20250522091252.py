To conduct market research for potential profitable trades, we need to analyze historical data and current market trends. We can use libraries like pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download stock data, and sklearn for prediction models. Here is a simple example of how you can do it.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Download historical data
data = yf.download('AAPL','2020-01-01','2022-12-31')

# Calculate the moving average
data['MA_10'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
data['MA_20'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Create a 'buy' column where if MA_10 > MA_20 then buy else 0
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['MA_10'] > data['MA_20']).astype(int)

# Shift the data to predict the closing price of the next day
data['Shifted_Close'] = data['Close'].shift(-1)

# Drop the rows with missing values
data = data.dropna()

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.drop(['Shifted_Close'],axis=1), data['Shifted_Close'], test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the absolute errors
errors = abs(predictions - y_test)

# Print out the mean absolute error
print('Mean Absolute Error:', round(np.mean(errors), 2))
```

This script downloads the historical data of a stock (in this case, Apple), calculates the moving averages, creates a buy signal, and trains a linear regression model to predict the closing price of the next day. The mean absolute error of the predictions is then printed out.

Please note that this is a very basic script and does not take into account many factors that can influence the stock price. For real trading, much more complex algorithms are used. Also, this script does not actually execute any trades, it just identifies potential profitable trades.
