Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs the backtest and returns the results, and a function `fallback_strategy()` that implements the fallback strategy.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    # Run the backtest
    results = run_backtest()

    # Check if the results are empty
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")
        # Run the fallback strategy
        results = fallback_strategy()

    return results

def run_backtest():
    # This function should run the backtest and return the results
    # For this example, it just returns an empty list
    return []

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement the fallback strategy
    # For this example, it just returns a list with a single element
    return [1]

# Test the function
print(get_backtest_results())
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results()` is the main function. It first tries to run the backtest by calling `run_backtest()`. If the results are empty (which is simulated by `run_backtest()` returning an empty list), it runs the fallback strategy by calling `fallback_strategy()`. The results of the fallback strategy are then returned.

Please replace `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` with your actual backtest and fallback strategy implementations.
