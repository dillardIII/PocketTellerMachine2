Sure, I can help with that. Here's a basic Python code snippet that uses the pandas library to calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and identify crossovers. This code assumes that you have a pandas DataFrame `df` with a 'Close' column for closing prices.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assuming df is your DataFrame and it has a 'Close' column

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def ema_crossover(data, short_window, long_window):
    # Calculate short and long EMA
    short_ema = calculate_ema(data['Close'], short_window)
    long_ema = calculate_ema(data['Close'], long_window)

    # Create signals
    data['short_ema'] = short_ema
    data['long_ema'] = long_ema
    data['signal'] = 0.0
    data['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(short_ema[short_window:] > long_ema[short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

    # Generate trading orders
    data['positions'] = data['signal'].diff()

    return data

# Use the function
df = ema_crossover(df, 12, 26)
```

This code will add several columns to your DataFrame:
- 'short_ema' for the short window EMA
- 'long_ema' for the long window EMA
- 'signal' for the trading signals (1.0 for buy, 0.0 for sell)
- 'positions' for the trading positions based on the crossover signals

Please replace the `df` with your actual dataframe and adjust the short and long window parameters as needed. Also, please note that this is a simple implementation and might need to be adjusted based on your specific requirements.
