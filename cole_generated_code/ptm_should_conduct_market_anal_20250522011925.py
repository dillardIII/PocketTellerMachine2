Sure, I can provide you with a basic Python code that uses pandas library to analyze market data. However, please note that this is a very simplified code and real market analysis would require more complex algorithms and more data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as web

# Define the stocks to analyze
stocks = ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN']

# Define the start and end dates
start_date = '2020-01-01'
end_date = '2021-12-31'

# Create an empty DataFrame to store the adjusted close price of the stocks
df = pd.DataFrame()

# Get the adjusted close price of the stocks
for stock in stocks:
    df[stock] = web.DataReader(stock, 'yahoo', start_date, end_date)['Adj Close']

# Calculate the daily returns
returns = df.pct_change()

# Identify potential trading opportunities
# For simplicity, we consider a stock has potential if its daily return is more than 2%
potential_stocks = returns[returns > 0.02].dropna(how='all')

print(potential_stocks)
```

This script will print the dates and stocks where the daily return was more than 2%. These could be considered as potential trading opportunities. However, keep in mind that this is a very simplistic approach and real trading strategies should consider more factors and use more sophisticated algorithms.
