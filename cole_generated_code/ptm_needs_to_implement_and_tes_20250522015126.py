Sure, I can provide a basic example of a simple trading strategy using Python. However, please note that this is a simplified example and actual trading strategies can be very complex and involve many factors.

We'll use the pandas library to handle our data and we'll implement a simple moving average crossover strategy. This strategy is based on the idea that if the short term moving average of a stock price crosses above the long term moving average, it's a buy signal and vice versa.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as pdr
import datetime

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Gather historical data
start = datetime.datetime(2019, 1, 1)
end = datetime.datetime(2021, 12, 31)

df = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickerSymbol, start, end)

# Calculate the short-term simple moving average (SMA)
short_sma = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-term SMA
long_sma = df['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create a column in the DataFrame to hold the trading signals
df['signal'] = 0.0

# Generate trading signals based on the crossover strategy
df['signal'][short_sma > long_sma] = 1.0
df['signal'][short_sma < long_sma] = -1.0

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```

This code will print a DataFrame with the stock's closing prices, short-term SMA, long-term SMA, and the trading signals. The signal is 1.0 when the short-term SMA is above the long-term SMA (indicating a buy) and -1.0 when the short-term SMA is below the long-term SMA (indicating a sell).

Please replace 'AAPL' with the ticker symbol of the stock you want to analyze. Also, you can adjust the windows for the short-term and long-term SMAs to fit your strategy.

Remember, this is a very basic strategy and doesn't take into account many factors that could influence a trading decision. Always do thorough research and consider multiple factors before making a trading decision.
