Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trading bot. This bot will initiate at least one trade. Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading bots are much more complex and require sophisticated algorithms and market analysis.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance
        self.stock = 0

    def trade(self):
        # Simulate the price of the stock
        stock_price = random.uniform(10.0, 50.0)

        # If we have enough balance, buy the stock
        if self.balance > stock_price:
            self.stock += 1
            self.balance -= stock_price
            print(f"Bought stock for ${stock_price}. Remaining balance: ${self.balance}")

        # If we have stock, sell it
        elif self.stock > 0:
            self.stock -= 1
            self.balance += stock_price
            print(f"Sold stock for ${stock_price}. Remaining balance: ${self.balance}")

        else:
            print("Not enough balance to trade.")

# Create a PTM with $1000 balance
ptm = PTM(1000)

# Initiate a trade
ptm.trade()
```

This code creates a PTM (Profit Trading Machine) with an initial balance. The `trade` method simulates the price of a stock and decides whether to buy or sell based on the current balance and the number of stocks owned. 

Please note that this code is a simple demonstration and doesn't guarantee a profit. In a real-world scenario, you would need a more sophisticated algorithm to decide when to buy or sell.
