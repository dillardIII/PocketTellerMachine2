Analyzing market trends and making informed trading decisions involves complex algorithms and requires real-time data. Here's a simple example of how you might start to approach this using Python. This code uses the pandas library to analyze historical stock data, and the yfinance library to download the stock data. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and doesn't actually make trading decisions. Real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take many more factors into account.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol 
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)
df = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# Use only Close price for simplicity
df = df[['Close']]

# Predict for the next 'n' days
forecast_out = 30

# Create another column (the target) shifted 'n' units up
df['Prediction'] = df[['Close']].shift(-forecast_out)

# Create the independent data set (X)
X = df.drop(['Prediction'], 1)[:-forecast_out]

# Create the dependent data set (y)
y = df['Prediction'][:-forecast_out]

# Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Create and train the Linear Regression Model
lr = LinearRegression()
lr.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Test the model using score
lr_confidence = lr.score(x_test, y_test)
print("lr confidence: ", lr_confidence)

# Set x_forecast equal to the last 30 rows of the original data set from Close column
x_forecast = df.drop(['Prediction'], 1)[:-forecast_out]
x_forecast = x_forecast.tail(forecast_out)

# Print linear regression model predictions for the next 'n' days
lr_prediction = lr.predict(x_forecast)
print(lr_prediction)
```

This script downloads historical data for a specific ticker symbol, trains a simple linear regression model on the closing prices, and then uses that model to predict the closing price for the next 30 days.

Please remember that this is a very simple model and is not suitable for actual trading. It doesn't take into account many factors that could influence a stock's price. Always consult with a financial advisor before making trading decisions.
