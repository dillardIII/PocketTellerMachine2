Creating a Python program that can analyze market trends and patterns is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of both financial markets and data analysis. Here's a simple example of how you might start to approach this problem using the pandas and yfinance libraries to analyze stock data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL','2020-01-01','2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Identify potential trading opportunities
# Buy signal: When SMA_50 crosses above SMA_200
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['SMA_50'] > data['SMA_200'])

# Sell signal: When SMA_50 crosses below SMA_200
data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['SMA_50'] < data['SMA_200'])

print(data)

# Predict future prices using linear regression
X = data['High'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = data['Close'].values.reshape(-1,1)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

regressor = LinearRegression()  
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train) #training the algorithm

#To retrieve the intercept:
print(regressor.intercept_)
#For retrieving the slope:
print(regressor.coef_)

y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)
df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test.flatten(), 'Predicted': y_pred.flatten()})
print(df)
```

This code downloads historical data for a specific stock (in this case, Apple), calculates two different moving averages (50-day and 200-day), and then generates buy and sell signals based on when these averages cross. It also uses linear regression to predict future prices based on past data.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors. Always consult with a financial advisor before making trading decisions.
