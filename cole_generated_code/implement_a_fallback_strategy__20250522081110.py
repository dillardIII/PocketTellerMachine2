Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found:

```python
def backtest_strategy(data):
    try:
        # Assume backtest() is a function that performs backtesting on the data
        results = backtest(data)
        if not results:
            raise ValueError("No backtest results found")
        return results
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
        print("Implementing fallback strategy...")
        # Assume fallback_strategy() is a function that implements the fallback strategy
        fallback_results = fallback_strategy(data)
        return fallback_results
```

In this code, we first attempt to perform backtesting on the data. If no results are found (i.e., if `results` is empty), we raise a `ValueError`. In the `except` block, we catch this `ValueError`, print an error message, and then implement the fallback strategy by calling `fallback_strategy(data)`. The results of the fallback strategy are then returned.

Please note that this is a high-level implementation and the actual implementation might vary based on how the `backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` functions are defined.
