The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market.

Here is a simple Python code that generates a trading strategy based on RSI:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from ta.momentum import RSIIndicator

def calculate_rsi(data, period):
    rsi_indicator = RSIIndicator(data['Close'], period)
    data['RSI'] = rsi_indicator.rsi()

def implement_rsi_strategy(data, buy_rsi, sell_rsi):
    buy_signals = []
    sell_signals = []
    bought = False

    for i in range(len(data)):
        if data['RSI'].iloc[i] < buy_rsi:
            if not bought:
                bought = True
                buy_signals.append(data['Close'].iloc[i])
                sell_signals.append(float('nan'))
            else:
                buy_signals.append(float('nan'))
                sell_signals.append(float('nan'))
        elif data['RSI'].iloc[i] > sell_rsi:
            if bought:
                bought = False
                sell_signals.append(data['Close'].iloc[i])
                buy_signals.append(float('nan'))
            else:
                buy_signals.append(float('nan'))
                sell_signals.append(float('nan'))
        else:
            buy_signals.append(float('nan'))
            sell_signals.append(float('nan'))

    return buy_signals, sell_signals

ticker = 'AAPL'
df = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')
calculate_rsi(df, 14)
df['Buy_Signal'], df['Sell_Signal'] = implement_rsi_strategy(df, 30, 70)
df
```

In this code, we first download the historical data for a specific ticker (in this case, 'AAPL') using the `yfinance` library. We then calculate the RSI for the closing prices with a period of 14 (which is the most commonly used period for RSI). 

The `implement_rsi_strategy` function implements the RSI strategy: if the RSI is below a certain threshold (in this case, 30), it generates a buy signal, and if the RSI is above a certain threshold (in this case, 70), it generates a sell signal. 

The buy and sell signals are then added to the dataframe. The resulting dataframe will contain the closing prices, the RSI, and the buy and sell signals for each day.
