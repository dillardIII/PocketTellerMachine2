Sure, here's a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic mean reversion trading strategy using pandas. This strategy assumes that the price of a stock will revert to its mean price over time. If the price is below the mean, it buys the stock, if it's above the mean, it sells the stock.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world trading strategies are much more complex and involve many other factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Let's assume we have a dataframe 'df' with stock prices
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'price': [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1]
})

# Calculate the mean price
mean_price = df['price'].mean()

# Create a column 'signal' that is 1 if the price is below the mean, and -1 if it's above the mean
df['signal'] = np.where(df['price'] < mean_price, 1, -1)

# Calculate daily returns
df['daily_return'] = df['price'].pct_change()

# Calculate strategy returns
df['strategy_return'] = df['signal'].shift() * df['daily_return']

# Calculate cumulative returns
df['cumulative_return'] = (1 + df['strategy_return']).cumprod()

print(df)
```

To test this strategy, you would typically split your data into a training set and a test set, and evaluate the performance of the strategy on the test set. You could use metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, the maximum drawdown, or the total return to evaluate the performance.

Remember, this is a very simple strategy and in reality, you would need to consider transaction costs, risk management, market impact, and many other factors. It's also important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.
