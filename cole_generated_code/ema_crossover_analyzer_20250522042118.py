To complete this task, we will use the `pandas` library for data manipulation and `yfinance` to download stock price data. The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Crossover Analyzer will calculate the EMA for two different periods (short-term and long-term) and then determine when the short-term EMA crosses above or below the long-term EMA.

Here is a simple implementation:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def ema_crossover_analyzer(ticker_symbol, short_window, long_window):
    # Download historical data as dataframe
    data = yf.download(ticker_symbol)

    # Calculate short and long EMA
    data['short_ema'] = calculate_ema(data['Close'], short_window)
    data['long_ema'] = calculate_ema(data['Close'], long_window)

    # Create signals
    data['signal'] = 0.0
    data['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(data['short_ema'][short_window:] > data['long_ema'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

    # Generate trading orders
    data['positions'] = data['signal'].diff()

    # Print data
    print(data)

    return data

# Use the function
ema_crossover_analyzer('AAPL', 12, 26)
```

This script will download the historical price data for the specified ticker symbol (in this case, 'AAPL' for Apple Inc.), calculate the short-term and long-term EMA (12 and 26 days, respectively), and then generate trading signals based on when the short-term EMA crosses the long-term EMA. When the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA, this is typically seen as a bullish signal, and the script will generate a 'buy' signal (1.0). Conversely, when the short-term EMA crosses below the long-term EMA, this is typically seen as a bearish signal, and the script will generate a 'sell' signal (-1.0). The script then prints the data to the console.

Please note that you need to install `yfinance` and `pandas` packages if they are not installed yet. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas
```
