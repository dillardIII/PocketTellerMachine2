To conduct a thorough market analysis, we need to use various data analysis libraries in Python such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. We also need to fetch financial data from a reliable source. For this, we can use yfinance library which allows us to download historical market data from Yahoo finance.

This is a simple example of how you can analyze a stock (Apple Inc. in this case) and plot its Close price, Volume and calculate its 20 days Moving Average.

Please note that this is a very basic form of market analysis and real-world trading opportunities identification involves more complex algorithms and models.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol (Apple Inc. in this case)
ticker = 'AAPL'
tickerData = yf.Ticker(ticker)
df = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# Calculate 20 days Moving Average
df['MA20'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Plot Close price, Volume and Moving Average 
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()

color = 'tab:red'
ax1.set_xlabel('Date')
ax1.set_ylabel('Close Price', color=color)
ax1.plot(df.index, df['Close'], color=color)
ax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor=color)

ax2 = ax1.twinx()
color = 'tab:blue'
ax2.set_ylabel('Volume', color=color)
ax2.plot(df.index, df['Volume'], color=color)
ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor=color)

fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(df.index, df['MA20'], label='20 days Moving Average')
ax.set_xlabel('Date')
ax.set_ylabel('Moving Average')
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

This script will plot the Close price and Volume of Apple Inc. stock in one graph and its 20 days Moving Average in another graph. You can identify trading opportunities by analyzing these graphs. For example, if the Close price crosses above the Moving Average, it might be a good time to buy. Similarly, if the Close price crosses below the Moving Average, it might be a good time to sell.
