Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    # This is a placeholder for the function that retrieves backtest results.
    # In a real-world scenario, this would likely involve querying a database or API.
    return {}

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy.")
    return {}

def execute_strategy():
    results = get_backtest_results()
    
    if not results:
        results = fallback_strategy()
    
    # Continue with the rest of the strategy execution, using the results.
    # This could involve trading decisions based on the results.
    
    return results

# Execute the strategy
execute_strategy()
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results()` is a placeholder function that should be replaced with the actual function for retrieving backtest results. If this function returns an empty result (which we're simulating here), the `fallback_strategy()` function is called. This function currently just prints a message and returns an empty dictionary, but it could be replaced with any fallback strategy you want.

The `execute_strategy()` function is where the strategy execution happens. It first tries to get the backtest results, and if none are found, it uses the fallback strategy. The rest of the strategy execution would then proceed using these results.
