Sure, here's a simple example of how you could implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the function will return a message saying "No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy."

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume `run_backtest` is a function that runs a backtest on a given strategy
    # and returns the results or None if no results are found
    backtest_results = run_backtest(strategy)

    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy.")
        # Assume `run_fallback_strategy` is a function that runs a fallback strategy
        fallback_results = run_fallback_strategy()
        return fallback_results

    return backtest_results
```

This is a very basic example. Depending on your specific needs, you might want to implement more complex fallback strategies. For example, you could try different strategies until you find one that produces results, or you could have a default strategy that you use whenever no backtest results are found.
