The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. Here is a simple Python code that generates a trading strategy based on RSI:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime
from pyti.relative_strength_index import relative_strength_index as rsi

def calculate_rsi(data, window):
    delta = data.diff()
    up, down = delta.copy(), delta.copy()
    up[up < 0] = 0
    down[down > 0] = 0
    avg_gain = up.rolling(window=window).mean()
    avg_loss = abs(down.rolling(window=window).mean())
    rs = avg_gain / avg_loss
    return 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))

def implement_rsi_strategy(prices, window=14):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=prices.index)
    signals['price'] = prices
    signals['rsi'] = calculate_rsi(prices, window)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0
    signals['signal'][window:] = np.where(signals['rsi'][window:] < 30, 1.0, 0.0)   # Oversold level
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()
    return signals

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end=datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))

# Implement the strategy
signals = implement_rsi_strategy(data['Close'])
print(signals)
```

In this code, we first calculate the RSI for a given window of days (default is 14). Then, we generate trading signals based on the RSI: we buy (1) when the RSI is below 30 (oversold condition) and sell (0) otherwise. The 'positions' column shows when the strategy signals to enter (1) or exit (-1) a position.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and should not be used for actual trading without further refinement and testing.
