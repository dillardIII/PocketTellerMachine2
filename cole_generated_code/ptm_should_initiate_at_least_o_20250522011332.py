Sure, here's a simple Python code using the `yfinance` library to download historical market data for a specific stock. This doesn't initiate a trade, but it's a starting point to gain insights on market trends. Please note that initiating a trade requires a brokerage account and API which is beyond the scope of this platform.

First, you need to install the `yfinance` library. You can do it using pip:

```python
pip install yfinance
```

Then you can use the following Python code:

```python
import yfinance as yf

def get_stock_data(ticker_symbol, start_date, end_date):
    ticker_data = yf.Ticker(ticker_symbol)
    return ticker_data.history(period='1d', start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Example usage:
data = get_stock_data("AAPL", "2020-01-01", "2021-12-31")
print(data)
```

This code will download the daily price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) for the years 2020 and 2021. You can replace "AAPL" with any other ticker symbol as per your requirement.

Please note that trading involves risks and should only be done with a clear understanding of these risks.
