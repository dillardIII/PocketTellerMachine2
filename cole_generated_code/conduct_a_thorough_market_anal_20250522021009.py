To conduct a thorough market analysis, we would need access to a lot of real-time financial data. This data is usually not freely available and is provided by financial data vendors such as Bloomberg, Reuters, etc. 

However, for the purpose of this task, we can use the `yfinance` library in Python, which allows us to download stock price data from Yahoo Finance, which is free to use. 

Here is a simple example of how you might use `yfinance` to download stock price data and analyze it to identify potential trading opportunities:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Define the ticker list
tickers_list = ['AAPL', 'WMT', 'IBM', 'MU', 'BA', 'AXP']

# Fetch the data
data = yf.download(tickers_list,'2015-1-1')['Adj Close']

# Print first 5 rows of the data
print(data.head())

# Calculate daily returns
returns = data.pct_change()

# Define a function to identify potential trading opportunities
# In this example, we will identify stocks with high volatility
def identify_trading_opportunities(returns):
    # Calculate the annualized volatility
    vol = returns.std() * np.sqrt(252)
    
    # Identify stocks with volatility greater than 0.5
    high_vol_stocks = vol[vol > 0.5].index.tolist()
    
    return high_vol_stocks

# Identify potential trading opportunities
opportunities = identify_trading_opportunities(returns)
print('Potential trading opportunities: ', opportunities)
```

Please note that this is a very simplistic analysis and real-world trading strategies would be much more complex and would take into account many other factors. Also, trading involves risk and this should not be considered as trading advice.
