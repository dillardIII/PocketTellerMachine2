Sure, I can provide you with a simple Python code that simulates a trading operation. Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading involves a lot more complexity.

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # initial balance
        self.trades = []

    def initiate_trade(self, trade):
        print(f"Initiating trade for {trade.name} at price {trade.price}")
        if self.balance > trade.price:
            self.trades.append(trade)
            self.balance -= trade.price
            print(f"Trade initiated successfully. Remaining balance: {self.balance}")
        else:
            print("Not enough balance to initiate trade")

    def calculate_profit_or_loss(self):
        market_price = random.randint(50, 150)  # simulate market price
        for trade in self.trades:
            if market_price > trade.price:
                profit = market_price - trade.price
                print(f"Trade for {trade.name} generated a profit of {profit}")
            else:
                loss = trade.price - market_price
                print(f"Trade for {trade.name} generated a loss of {loss}")

# create PTM and initiate a trade
ptm = PTM()
trade = Trade("Apple", 100)
ptm.initiate_trade(trade)

# calculate profit or loss
ptm.calculate_profit_or_loss()
```

In this code, we first define a `Trade` class that holds the name and price of a trade. Then we define a `PTM` class that can initiate trades and calculate profit or loss based on a simulated market price. We then create a PTM, initiate a trade for Apple at a price of 100, and calculate the profit or loss.
