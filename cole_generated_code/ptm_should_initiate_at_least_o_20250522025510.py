Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade. This code uses a fictional trading API and is for illustrative purposes only. In real-world scenarios, you would need to use the API provided by your brokerage or trading platform.

```python
import random
import time

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, trading_api):
        self.trading_api = trading_api

    def evaluate_strategy(self):
        # Initiate a trade
        stock = 'AAPL'
        price = self.trading_api.get_current_price(stock)
        quantity = 1
        self.trading_api.place_order(stock, quantity, price)

        # Wait for some time to see how the trade performs
        time.sleep(60)

        # Check the effectiveness of the strategy
        new_price = self.trading_api.get_current_price(stock)
        profit = (new_price - price) * quantity

        return profit

class TradingAPI:
    def get_current_price(self, stock):
        # This is a mock function. Replace this with actual API call.
        return random.uniform(100, 200)

    def place_order(self, stock, quantity, price):
        # This is a mock function. Replace this with actual API call.
        print(f"Placed an order for {quantity} shares of {stock} at {price}")

# Usage
trading_api = TradingAPI()
ptm = PTM(trading_api)
profit = ptm.evaluate_strategy()
print(f"Profit from the trade: {profit}")
```

This code defines a `PTM` class that has a method `evaluate_strategy`. This method initiates a trade, waits for some time, and then calculates the profit from the trade. The `TradingAPI` class is a mock trading API that simulates the behavior of a real trading API. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this with the actual API provided by your trading platform.
