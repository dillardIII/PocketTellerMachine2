Sure, first, let's define the function conduct_backtests that performs the backtesting tasks and returns a result. If no backtest result is found, handle it with the implemented fallback strategy. For simplicity, the fallback strategy used in this case will just return a default message informing the user that no backtest results were found.

```python
def conduct_backtests():
    # Code for conducting backtests goes here...
    backtest_results = None 

    # Let's assume that the above code sometimes does not yield any results...
    if not backtest_results:
        return fallback_strategy()
    else:
        return backtest_results

def fallback_strategy():
    default_message = "No backtest results found. You might want to adjust your trading strategies."
    return default_message

print(conduct_backtests())
```

In this code:
- The conduct_backtests function is supposed to conduct some backtest based on some trading strategies. If it finds some results, it returns them, otherwise it calls the fallback_strategy.
- The fallback_strategy function just returns a default message saying that no backtest results were found and suggesting to adjust the trading strategies.

Please replace # Code for conducting backtests goes here... with your own_backtest operation and update fallback_strategy as per your needs to match with your own fallback process specifications.
