Sure, here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy using Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the program will print a message and then proceed to execute the fallback strategy.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Attempt to backtest the strategy
    results = strategy.backtest()

    # Check if results are empty
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results:")
        print(results)

def fallback_strategy():
    # Fallback strategy implementation goes here
    print("Executing fallback strategy...")

    # For demonstration, let's just print a message
    print("Fallback strategy executed successfully.")

# Assuming we have a strategy object
strategy = Strategy()
backtest_strategy(strategy)
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the `backtest()` method and the `fallback_strategy()` function would depend on the specifics of your trading system. The above code is a simple demonstration of how you can structure your code to handle a situation where no backtest results are found.
