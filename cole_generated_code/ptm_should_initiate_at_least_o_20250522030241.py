Sure, here is a simple Python code that uses a hypothetical trading API to initiate a trade. Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading involves more complexities.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, trading_api):
        self.trading_api = trading_api

    def evaluate_strategy(self):
        # Initiate a trade
        stock = self.select_stock()
        self.trading_api.place_order(stock, "buy", 1)

    def select_stock(self):
        # Select a stock randomly for simplicity
        stocks = self.trading_api.get_available_stocks()
        return random.choice(stocks)


class TradingAPI:
    def get_available_stocks(self):
        # Return a list of available stocks
        return ["AAPL", "GOOG", "TSLA", "AMZN"]

    def place_order(self, stock, order_type, quantity):
        # Place an order
        print(f"Placing order: {order_type} {quantity} {stock}")


# Usage
trading_api = TradingAPI()
ptm = PTM(trading_api)
ptm.evaluate_strategy()
```

In this code, PTM is a trading system that uses a trading API to place orders. The `evaluate_strategy` method of PTM initiates a trade by selecting a stock and placing a buy order for it. The selection of the stock is done randomly in the `select_stock` method for simplicity.

The TradingAPI class is a mock trading API that has methods to get available stocks and place an order. In a real-world scenario, this would involve communication with a brokerage or a stock exchange.

Please replace the TradingAPI with your actual trading API and add your trading strategies in the `evaluate_strategy` method.
