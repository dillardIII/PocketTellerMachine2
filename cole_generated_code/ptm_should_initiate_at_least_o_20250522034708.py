Sure, here's a simple Python code that uses the `alpaca-trade-api` package to initiate a trade. This code will buy 1 share of Apple stock as a market order.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Replace these with your API connection info
APCA_API_BASE_URL = 'https://paper-api.alpaca.markets'
APCA_API_KEY_ID = 'your_api_key_id'
APCA_API_SECRET_KEY = 'your_api_secret_key'

api = tradeapi.REST(APCA_API_KEY_ID, APCA_API_SECRET_KEY, APCA_API_BASE_URL, api_version='v2')

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

Please replace `'your_api_key_id'` and `'your_api_secret_key'` with your actual Alpaca API key ID and secret key. Also, this is a paper trading API URL which means it's for testing and doesn't involve real money.

This is a very basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would likely want to incorporate more complex trading strategies, risk management, and possibly use real-time data to make decisions.

Please note that trading involves risk, and this code is provided as an example. You should understand what this code does before you run it.
