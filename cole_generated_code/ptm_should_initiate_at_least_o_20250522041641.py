Here's a simple Python code using `yfinance` library to download the historical market data and initiate a trade. This example uses a simple strategy: if the closing price of the last trading day is lower than the day before, it will initiate a buy order for the next day.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and should not be used for real trading. This is for illustrative purposes only.

```python
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start=(datetime.now() - timedelta(days=2)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), end=datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Check if the closing price of the last trading day is lower than the day before
if tickerDf['Close'][-1] < tickerDf['Close'][-2]:
    print("Initiate a BUY order for", tickerSymbol)
else:
    print("No trade initiated for", tickerSymbol)
```

This code will print out the historical data for the last two days and initiate a buy order if the condition is met. Please replace `'AAPL'` with the ticker symbol of the stock you want to trade.

Please note that this code does not actually execute a trade, it only simulates the decision process. To execute real trades, you would need to integrate with a trading platform API, like Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, etc. and you should have proper permissions and follow regulations.
