Sure, here's a basic example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the fallback strategy will simply print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your actual backtest implementation
    # It should return a dictionary with the backtest results
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy.")
    return {}

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest_strategy(strategy)

    if not results:
        results = fallback_strategy()

    return results
```

In this code, `execute_strategy` is the main function that you would call to execute a trading strategy. It first tries to backtest the strategy by calling `backtest_strategy`. If no results are found (i.e., if `results` is empty), it then calls `fallback_strategy` to get the fallback results.

Please replace the `backtest_strategy` function with your actual backtest implementation. The `fallback_strategy` function should also be replaced with whatever you want your fallback strategy to be.
