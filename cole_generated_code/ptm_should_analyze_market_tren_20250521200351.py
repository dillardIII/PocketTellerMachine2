Unfortunately, writing a Python code to analyze market trends and patterns to identify potential trading opportunities is a complex task that involves a deep understanding of financial markets and machine learning. However, I can provide a simple example of how you might start to approach this problem using Python and pandas library.

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as web
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Get the stock data
df = web.DataReader('AAPL', data_source='yahoo', start='2012-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate the moving average
df['MA50'] = df['Adj Close'].rolling(50).mean()
df['MA200'] = df['Adj Close'].rolling(200).mean()

# Create a new data frame for the features
features = df[['High','Low','Open','Volume']].shift().dropna()
targets = df['Adj Close']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, targets, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()  
model.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(x_test)

# Calculate the absolute errors
errors = abs(predictions - y_test)

# Print out the mean absolute error
print('Mean Absolute Error:', round(np.mean(errors), 2))

# Plot the data
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(df['Adj Close'])
plt.plot(df['MA50'])
plt.plot(df['MA200'])
plt.title('Stock Price with Moving Averages')
plt.legend(['Adj Close', 'MA50', 'MA200'])
plt.show()
```

This script gets the historical stock data for a specific company (in this case, Apple), calculates the moving averages, and uses a simple linear regression model to predict future prices. It then calculates the mean absolute error of the predictions and plots the stock price with the moving averages.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take many more factors into account.
