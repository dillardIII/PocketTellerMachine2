Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a basic example of how you might implement an EMA Crossover Analyzer in Python using the `pandas` library. This example assumes that you have a pandas DataFrame `df` with a 'Close' column for the closing prices.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assuming df is your DataFrame and it has a 'Close' column

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def ema_crossover(data, short_window, long_window):
    # Calculate short and long EMA
    short_ema = calculate_ema(data['Close'], short_window)
    long_ema = calculate_ema(data['Close'], long_window)

    # Create signals
    data['short_ema'] = short_ema
    data['long_ema'] = long_ema
    data['signal'] = 0.0
    data['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(short_ema[short_window:] > long_ema[short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

    # Generate trading orders
    data['positions'] = data['signal'].diff()

    # Return dataframe
    return data

# Use the function
df = ema_crossover(df, 12, 26)
```

In this code, the `calculate_ema` function is used to calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for a given window of data. The `ema_crossover` function calculates the short and long EMA, creates a signal when the short EMA crosses the long EMA, and generates trading orders based on these signals.

Please note that you need to replace `df` with your actual dataframe and 'Close' with the actual column name that contains the closing prices. Also, you may need to adjust the short and long window parameters (12 and 26 in this case) according to your needs.
