Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation for PTM (Python Trading Machine). Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading involves more complex algorithms and risk management strategies.

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, symbol, quantity):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.quantity = quantity

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []
        self.experience = 0
        self.wins = 0

    def initiate_trade(self, trade):
        print(f"Initiating trade: {trade.symbol}, Quantity: {trade.quantity}")
        self.trades.append(trade)
        self.experience += 1

        # Simulate win/loss with 50/50 chance
        if random.randint(0, 1) == 1:
            self.wins += 1
            print(f"Trade successful! Wins: {self.wins}")
        else:
            print("Trade failed.")

# Create PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
trade = Trade("AAPL", 100)
ptm.initiate_trade(trade)
```

This code creates a `PTM` class which has methods to initiate trades. Each trade increases the experience of the PTM. The outcome of the trade (win or loss) is simulated with a 50/50 chance. If the trade is successful, the number of wins is increased.
