Here is a simple example of how you might implement and test different trading strategies in Python. In this example, we will use the `yfinance` library to download stock price data, and `pandas` for data manipulation. We will implement two simple trading strategies: a momentum strategy and a mean reversion strategy.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Define the tickers of the stocks in the portfolio
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'FB']

# Download historical data
data = yf.download(tickers, start='2020-01-01', end='2021-12-31')

# Calculate returns
data['Return'] = data['Adj Close'].pct_change()

# Momentum strategy: buy if the stock went up yesterday, sell if it went down
data['Momentum Signal'] = np.sign(data['Return'].shift(1))
data['Momentum Strategy Return'] = data['Momentum Signal'] * data['Return']

# Mean reversion strategy: buy if the stock went down yesterday, sell if it went up
data['Mean Reversion Signal'] = -np.sign(data['Return'].shift(1))
data['Mean Reversion Strategy Return'] = data['Mean Reversion Signal'] * data['Return']

# Calculate cumulative returns
data['Momentum Cumulative Return'] = (1 + data['Momentum Strategy Return']).cumprod() - 1
data['Mean Reversion Cumulative Return'] = (1 + data['Mean Reversion Strategy Return']).cumprod() - 1

# Print the last rows of the dataframe
print(data.tail())
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world trading strategies would be much more complex. Also, this code does not take into account transaction costs, slippage, or other factors that could impact performance. Always do thorough backtesting and risk management before trading live.
