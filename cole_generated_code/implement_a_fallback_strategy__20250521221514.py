Here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this example, I'm assuming that `backtest()` is a function that performs the backtest and returns results or `None` if no results are found. The fallback strategy is simply printing a message, but you can replace it with any other action.

```python
def backtest():
    # This function should implement the backtest and return the results.
    # If no results are found, it should return None.
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function implements the fallback strategy.
    print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")

def perform_backtest():
    results = backtest()
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")
        # Process the results here.
```

You can call `perform_backtest()` to perform the backtest and automatically implement the fallback strategy if no results are found. 

Please replace the `backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` functions with your actual implementations.
