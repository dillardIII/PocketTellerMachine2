Sure, here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the code will print a message and then proceed to execute the fallback strategy.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Run backtest
    results = strategy.run_backtest()

    # Check if results are empty
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found. Proceeding with strategy.")
        # Continue with your code here

def fallback_strategy():
    # Define your fallback strategy here
    print("Running fallback strategy.")

# Define your strategy here
class Strategy:
    def run_backtest(self):
        # This is just a placeholder. Replace this with your actual backtest code.
        return None

strategy = Strategy()
backtest_strategy(strategy)
```

In this code, `Strategy` is a placeholder class that represents your trading strategy. You would replace this with your actual strategy class. The `run_backtest` method is also a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual method to run the backtest. If the backtest returns no results, the `fallback_strategy` function is called. You would need to define what the fallback strategy should do in this function.
