To increase the number of trades, we can simply increase the number of iterations in a trading loop. However, please note that increasing the number of trades doesn't necessarily improve the chances of recording wins. It depends on the trading strategy, market conditions, and many other factors. Here is a simple example of how you might increase the number of trades in a Python trading bot:

```python
import random

class TradingBot:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance):
        self.balance = initial_balance
        self.trades = []

    def trade(self):
        # This is a very simple trading strategy for demonstration purposes only
        # In reality, you would use a more sophisticated strategy
        if random.random() > 0.5:
            self.balance += 10
            self.trades.append('win')
        else:
            self.balance -= 10
            self.trades.append('loss')

    def run(self, num_trades):
        for _ in range(num_trades):
            self.trade()

# Increase the number of trades to 10000
bot = TradingBot(1000)
bot.run(10000)

print(f'Final balance: {bot.balance}')
print(f'Number of wins: {bot.trades.count("win")}')
print(f'Number of losses: {bot.trades.count("loss")}')
```

This code creates a simple trading bot that makes a series of trades. Each trade has a 50% chance of winning and a 50% chance of losing. The bot starts with an initial balance of 1000 and makes 10000 trades. The final balance and the number of wins and losses are printed at the end.
