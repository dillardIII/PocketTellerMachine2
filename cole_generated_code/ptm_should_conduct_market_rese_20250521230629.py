To conduct market research, we can use APIs to fetch real-time data from the stock market. Here is a simple example of how to do this using the yfinance library in Python, which allows you to download stock data from Yahoo Finance.

```python
import yfinance as yf

def get_stock_data(ticker_symbol):
    # Get the data for the stock
    stock = yf.Ticker(ticker_symbol)

    # Get historical market data
    hist = stock.history(period="5d")

    return hist

def identify_opportunities(data):
    # This is a placeholder for your market research logic
    # You could analyze the data for patterns, use machine learning models, etc.
    # For this example, let's just say if the latest close price is higher than the previous day's, it's a potential opportunity
    if data['Close'].iloc[-1] > data['Close'].iloc[-2]:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Use the function
data = get_stock_data("AAPL")
opportunity = identify_opportunities(data)

if opportunity:
    print("Potential trading opportunity identified!")
else:
    print("No trading opportunities identified at this time.")
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example. Real-world market research would involve much more complex analysis and would likely use more sophisticated methods for identifying potential trading opportunities.
