Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. This code does not connect to a real trading platform, but it gives you an idea of how it might work.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []

    def initiate_trade(self, stock, quantity, trade_type):
        trade_id = random.randint(1000, 9999)
        trade = {
            'trade_id': trade_id,
            'stock': stock,
            'quantity': quantity,
            'type': trade_type
        }
        self.trades.append(trade)
        print(f"Trade initiated. Trade ID: {trade_id}")
        return trade

# Create PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
trade = ptm.initiate_trade('AAPL', 100, 'buy')

# Print the trade
print(trade)
```

In this code, PTM is a class that represents a trading system. It has a method called `initiate_trade` that initiates a trade. The trade is represented as a dictionary with keys 'trade_id', 'stock', 'quantity', and 'type'. The 'trade_id' is a random number between 1000 and 9999, 'stock' is the stock symbol, 'quantity' is the number of shares to trade, and 'type' is either 'buy' or 'sell'.

Please note that this is a very simplified representation of a trading system. In a real-world application, you would need to connect to a trading platform API, handle authentication, manage errors, and more.
