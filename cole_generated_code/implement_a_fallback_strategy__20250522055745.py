Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest implementation
    # It should return the backtest results if they exist, and None otherwise
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your fallback strategy
    # It should return some kind of result even when the backtest fails
    pass

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Falling back to fallback strategy.")
        results = fallback_strategy()
    return results
```

In this example, the `execute_strategy` function tries to run a backtest on a given strategy. If no results are found (i.e., if `backtest(strategy)` returns `None`), it falls back to a fallback strategy.

You would need to replace the `backtest` and `fallback_strategy` functions with your actual implementation. The `backtest` function should return `None` when no results are found, and the `fallback_strategy` function should return some kind of result even when the backtest fails.
