Sure, I can provide a basic example of how you might use Python to analyze market trends. This example will use the `pandas` library for data manipulation and `yfinance` to download stock price data. We will also use `matplotlib` for visualization.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world financial analysis would require a much more thorough approach.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Calculate simple moving average
tickerDf['SMA'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=14).mean()

# Calculate standard deviation
tickerDf['STD'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=14).std()

# Calculate upper Bollinger Band
tickerDf['Upper'] = tickerDf['SMA'] + (tickerDf['STD'] * 2)

# Calculate lower Bollinger Band
tickerDf['Lower'] = tickerDf['SMA'] - (tickerDf['STD'] * 2)

# Plot everything
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(tickerDf['Close'], label='Close Price', color='blue')
plt.plot(tickerDf['SMA'], label='Simple Moving Average', color='red')
plt.plot(tickerDf['Upper'], label='Upper Bollinger Band', color='green')
plt.plot(tickerDf['Lower'], label='Lower Bollinger Band', color='orange')
plt.fill_between(tickerDf.index, tickerDf['Upper'], tickerDf['Lower'], color='grey', alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Bollinger Band for AAPL')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This script downloads the historical price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from 2010 to 2020. It then calculates a simple moving average and standard deviation for the closing prices. The upper and lower Bollinger Bands are then calculated and everything is plotted on a graph.

Bollinger Bands are a type of statistical chart characterizing the prices and volatility over time of a financial instrument or commodity, using a formulaic method propounded by John Bollinger in the 1980s. They are used in trading as signals for buying and selling.
