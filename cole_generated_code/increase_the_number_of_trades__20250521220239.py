To increase the number of trades, you could use a loop in Python. However, the actual trading part would require an API or some sort of trading algorithm. Here is a basic example of how you might set up the loop:

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self):
        self.wins = 0
        self.losses = 0

    def make_trade(self):
        # Here we'll just randomize a win or loss. In a real situation, you'd use an API or algorithm.
        if random.randint(0, 1) == 0:
            self.wins += 1
        else:
            self.losses += 1

    def report(self):
        print(f"Wins: {self.wins}, Losses: {self.losses}")

# Create a new trade instance
trade = Trade()

# Increase the number of trades to improve chances of recording wins
for _ in range(1000):
    trade.make_trade()

trade.report()
```

In this example, we're just randomly determining whether each trade is a win or a loss. In a real trading situation, you'd want to replace the `make_trade` method with actual trading logic. You might also want to add more sophisticated tracking, such as tracking the amount of money won or lost in each trade.
