I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but your request seems to be more related to a business strategy or management task rather than a coding task. Python is a programming language and it can't conduct a review of a company's trading approach. 

However, if you have specific data analysis tasks, such as analyzing trading data, calculating trading metrics, or visualizing trading performance, Python can be very useful. Please provide more details about the data and the specific analysis tasks, and I'd be happy to help with the Python code for that.
