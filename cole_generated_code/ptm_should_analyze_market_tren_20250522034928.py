To analyze market trends and patterns, we can use Python's pandas library for data manipulation and analysis, and yfinance to download historical market data from Yahoo! finance. We can also use matplotlib for data visualization and statsmodels for statistical modeling.

Here is a simple Python code that downloads historical data for a specific stock, calculates its moving averages, and plots the data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = "AAPL"
data = yf.download(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA10'] = data['Close'].rolling(10).mean()
data['MA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(50).mean()

# Plot closing price and moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.grid(True)
plt.plot(data['Close'],label='Close')
plt.plot(data['MA10'], label='MA 10 days')
plt.plot(data['MA50'], label='MA 50 days')
plt.legend(loc=2)
plt.show()

# Decompose time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components
decomposition = seasonal_decompose(data['Close'], model='multiplicative', period = 30)

trend = decomposition.trend
seasonal = decomposition.seasonal
residual = decomposition.resid

# Plot the original data, the trend, the seasonality, and the residuals 
plt.subplot(411)
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Original')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.subplot(412)
plt.plot(trend, label='Trend')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.subplot(413)
plt.plot(seasonal,label='Seasonality')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.subplot(414)
plt.plot(residual, label='Residuals')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This code provides a simple moving average crossover strategy and decomposes the time series into trend and seasonality. However, it's important to note that real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors. Also, this code does not actually execute any trades, it just identifies potential trading opportunities based on historical data.
