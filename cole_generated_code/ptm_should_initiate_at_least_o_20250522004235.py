Sure, I can provide a basic Python code example that simulates a trade initiation. However, please note that real trading requires a complex system and should be done using established trading platforms and APIs. Here is a simple example:

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, symbol, volume):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.volume = volume

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []

    def initiate_trade(self, trade):
        self.trades.append(trade)
        print(f"Trade initiated: {trade.symbol} for volume {trade.volume}")

    def get_insights(self):
        symbols = [trade.symbol for trade in self.trades]
        volumes = [trade.volume for trade in self.trades]

        print(f"Most traded symbol: {max(set(symbols), key = symbols.count)}")
        print(f"Average trade volume: {sum(volumes) / len(volumes)}")

# Create PTM
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate trades
for i in range(10):
    trade = Trade(f"Stock{i}", random.randint(1, 100))
    ptm.initiate_trade(trade)

# Get insights
ptm.get_insights()
```

In this code, we create a PTM (Portfolio Trade Manager) that can initiate trades and provide insights on them. We simulate the initiation of 10 trades with random volumes. The insights provided are the most traded symbol and the average trade volume. 

Again, this is a very simplified example and real trading involves many more factors and complexities.
