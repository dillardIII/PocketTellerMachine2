Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that simulates a trading system. This code doesn't connect to a real trading platform, but it can be a starting point for your real trading bot.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []
        self.wins = 0
        self.losses = 0

    def initiate_trade(self):
        # Here we simulate a trade with random outcome
        # In a real trading bot, you would connect to your trading platform and initiate a trade
        outcome = random.choice(['win', 'loss'])
        self.trades.append(outcome)

        if outcome == 'win':
            self.wins += 1
        else:
            self.losses += 1

    def report(self):
        print(f"Total trades: {len(self.trades)}")
        print(f"Wins: {self.wins}")
        print(f"Losses: {self.losses}")


# Create a PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
ptm.initiate_trade()

# Print report
ptm.report()
```

In this code, we create a PTM class that has methods for initiating a trade and reporting on the outcomes. The `initiate_trade` method simulates a trade with a random outcome, either 'win' or 'loss'. The `report` method prints the total number of trades, wins, and losses.
