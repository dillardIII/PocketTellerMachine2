To analyze market trends and patterns, we can use the pandas library in Python to manipulate and analyze data. We can also use yfinance to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance. For simplicity, let's assume that we are looking for opportunities in the stock market and we will use a simple moving average crossover strategy to identify these opportunities.

Here's a simple Python script that does this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# Calculate the short-term simple moving average
short_sma = tickerDf.Close.rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-term simple moving average
long_sma = tickerDf.Close.rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create a new column in the dataframe to hold the buy signals
tickerDf['Buy_Signal'] = (short_sma > long_sma)

# Create a new column in the dataframe to hold the sell signals
tickerDf['Sell_Signal'] = (short_sma < long_sma)

# Print the dataframe
print(tickerDf)
```

This script downloads the historical price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from 2010 to 2020. It then calculates the 20-day and 100-day simple moving averages of the closing prices. If the short-term average is greater than the long-term average, this is a potential buy signal. If the short-term average is less than the long-term average, this is a potential sell signal.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real trading algorithms are much more complex. They would take into account many more factors and use more sophisticated statistical methods. Also, this script doesn't actually execute any trades, it just identifies potential trading opportunities.
