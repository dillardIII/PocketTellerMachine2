To analyze market trends and identify potential trading opportunities, we can use Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download the stock data, and matplotlib for data visualization. Here is a simple Python code to analyze market trends:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters
register_matplotlib_converters()

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Plot the close price of the stock
tickerDf['Close'].plot(figsize=(10, 7))
plt.title("Close Price of %s" % tickerSymbol, fontsize=16)
plt.ylabel('Price', fontsize=14)
plt.xlabel('Year', fontsize=14)
plt.grid(which="major", color='k', linestyle='-.', linewidth=0.5)
plt.show()
```

This code will download the historical market data for Apple Inc. from 2010 to 2020 and plot the closing prices. 

Please note that this is a simple trend analysis and does not include potential trading opportunities. For identifying trading opportunities, more advanced techniques like Machine Learning, Technical Analysis (Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, etc.), and Fundamental Analysis are used. 

Also, please make sure to install the required libraries by using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas yfinance matplotlib
```

Lastly, please be aware that financial trading involves risks. This code is a simple example and should not be used for actual trading without further enhancements.
