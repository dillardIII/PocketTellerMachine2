In order to initiate a trade, we need to have some information about the market, like the prices of different stocks, their historical data, etc. However, since we don't have any specific data, I'll write a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation.

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, stock, price, quantity):
        self.stock = stock
        self.price = price
        self.quantity = quantity

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # initial balance
        self.portfolio = {}  # stocks owned

    def initiate_trade(self, trade):
        cost = trade.price * trade.quantity
        if cost > self.balance:
            print("Not enough balance to initiate the trade.")
            return
        self.balance -= cost
        self.portfolio[trade.stock] = self.portfolio.get(trade.stock, 0) + trade.quantity
        print(f"Trade initiated. Bought {trade.quantity} of {trade.stock} at {trade.price}. Current balance: {self.balance}")

# create PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# create a trade
trade = Trade('AAPL', 150, 10)

# initiate trade
ptm.initiate_trade(trade)
```

This code creates a PTM (Portfolio Trade Manager) that can initiate trades. It checks if the balance is enough to initiate the trade, if not, it prints an error message. If the balance is enough, it initiates the trade, updates the balance and the portfolio, and prints a success message. 

Please note that this is a very simplified version of a trading system. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider many other factors like market data, trading fees, etc.
