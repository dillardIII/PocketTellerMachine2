Here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. The function `backtest_strategy` takes a trading strategy as input, backtests it, and returns the results. If no results are found, it falls back to a default strategy.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Backtest the strategy
    results = strategy.backtest()
    
    # If no results are found, fall back to a default strategy
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Falling back to default strategy.")
        default_strategy = DefaultStrategy()
        results = default_strategy.backtest()
        
    return results
```

Please note that this is a simple example and the actual implementation may vary based on the details of your trading strategies, backtesting methods, and what you consider as a 'default' strategy. Also, the `DefaultStrategy` class and `backtest` method are placeholders and would need to be replaced with your actual trading strategy classes and backtesting methods.
