To initiate a trade, we need to have a trading system in place. Python doesn't have a built-in trading function, but we can use libraries like `yfinance` to fetch data from Yahoo Finance and `alpaca_trade_api` to make trades. Here is a simple example of how to initiate a trade using `alpaca_trade_api`.

Please note that you need to have an Alpaca account and API keys to use this.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Replace these with your API connection info from the dashboard
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Check if the market is open now.
clock = api.get_clock()
if clock.is_open:
    # Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
    api.submit_order(
        symbol='AAPL',
        qty=1,
        side='buy',
        type='market',
        time_in_force='gtc'
    )
else:
    print("The market is closed at this moment.")
```

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock if the market is open. Please replace `<APCA-API-KEY-ID>` and `<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>` with your actual API keys. Also, this is a paper trading API URL, which means it's for testing and won't make actual trades. If you want to do actual trading, you need to use the live trading API URL.

Please note that trading involves risks, and this code is a very basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to implement more sophisticated strategies, risk management, and error handling.
