Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code for a trading strategy. This strategy will be based on simple moving average (SMA). The idea is to buy when the short-term SMA crosses above the long-term SMA and sell when the short-term SMA crosses below the long-term SMA.

Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading strategies are much more complex and take into account many other factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as web

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
df = web.DataReader(tickerSymbol, 'yahoo', '2020-1-1', '2021-1-1')

# Calculate the short-term SMA and long-term SMA
short_sma = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
long_sma = df['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create a column in the DataFrame to hold the trading signals
df['signal'] = 0.0

# Generate trading signals based on the SMA crossover
df['signal'][20:] = np.where(short_sma[20:] > long_sma[20:], 1.0, 0.0)

# Generate trading orders based on the trading signals
df['positions'] = df['signal'].diff()

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```

In this code, we first fetch the historical data for a specific ticker symbol (in this case, AAPL for Apple Inc.) from Yahoo Finance. We then calculate the short-term and long-term SMAs of the closing prices. The trading signals are generated based on the SMA crossover: when the short-term SMA crosses above the long-term SMA, the signal is 1 (indicating a buy), and when the short-term SMA crosses below the long-term SMA, the signal is 0 (indicating a sell). The trading orders are then generated based on the changes in the trading signals.

Please note that this code requires the `pandas`, `pandas_datareader`, and `numpy` libraries. Also, this is a very basic strategy and may not be profitable in real trading. Always backtest your strategies before using them in live trading.
