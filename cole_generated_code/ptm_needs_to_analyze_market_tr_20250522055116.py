To analyze market trends and identify potential winning trades, we need to use some kind of financial data. We can use the `yfinance` library to get stock data, and `pandas` to analyze it. Here is a simple example:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'GOOGL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2020-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Calculate the moving average
tickerDf['MA'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Identify potential winning trades
winning_trades = tickerDf[tickerDf['Close'] > tickerDf['MA']]

print(winning_trades)
```

This script will download the historical price data for Google's stock for the year 2020, calculate the 20-day moving average, and then identify the days where the closing price was higher than the moving average, which could indicate a potential winning trade.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and might not be profitable in real trading. You should use more sophisticated strategies and consider more factors (like volume, other technical indicators, news, etc.) in real trading.
