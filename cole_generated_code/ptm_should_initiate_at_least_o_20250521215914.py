To initiate a trade and gain insights on market trends, you would need to use an API of a trading platform. Here's an example of how you might do it using the Alpaca API, which allows for commission-free trading. 

Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading involves more complexity and risk. Always ensure you understand the API and trading platform you are using. 

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Setup
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Get daily price data for AAPL over the last 5 trading days.
barset = api.get_barset('AAPL', 'day', limit=5)
aapl_bars = barset['AAPL']

# See how much AAPL moved in that timeframe.
week_open = aapl_bars[0].o
week_close = aapl_bars[-1].c
percent_change = (week_close - week_open) / week_open * 100
print('AAPL moved {}% over the last 5 days'.format(percent_change))

# Now we can use this information to make a trade.
if percent_change > 0.5:
    # If the stock price increased over 0.5% over the last 5 days, let's buy 1 share.
    api.submit_order(
        symbol='AAPL',
        qty=1,
        side='buy',
        type='market',
        time_in_force='gtc'
    )
```

This code retrieves the last 5 days of price data for AAPL, calculates the percentage change, and if the change is greater than 0.5%, it initiates a buy order for 1 share of AAPL.

Please replace '<APCA-API-KEY-ID>' and '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>' with your actual Alpaca API key ID and secret key.

Also, please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and is not recommended for actual trading. It's just an example of how you might initiate a trade using Python and the Alpaca API.
