To write a Python code that can review and adjust strategies for potential trades, the most logical step would be to create a model that could analyze past performance of different investment strategies and then make adjustments based on their success rate. This could imply the use of a Machine Learning algorithm.

Please note that implementation of such a system is complex and requires significant financial knowledge and a robust dataset.

Here is a basic concept for how the code might look, using pandas` DataFrame to handle the data and scikit-learn` library for Machine Learning:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Assume we have a DataFrame 'df' with historical trade data
df = pd.read_csv('historical_data.csv')

# Define input variables (investment strategies) and target variable (success rate)
X = df.drop('Success', axis=1)
y = df['Success']

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Create a Random Forest Regressor model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print("Accuracy: ", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))

# Let's assume we have data 'new_data' for which we want to predict the potential success
new_data = pd.read_csv('new_data.csv')
new_predictions = model.predict(new_data)

# Printing potential trades
print("Potential trades: ", new_predictions)
```

This code only serves as a concept, actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements, available data, and context.
