Sure, here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this example, we'll assume that the backtest function returns None when no results are found.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your actual backtest function
    # It should return the backtest results if they exist, and None otherwise
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is your fallback strategy
    # It could be anything you want, like buying a safe asset or staying in cash
    print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy.")

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # If backtest results exist, execute the original strategy
        print("Backtest results found. Executing original strategy.")

# Test the function with a strategy
execute_strategy("my_strategy")
```

In this code, `execute_strategy` first tries to get backtest results for a given strategy. If no results are found (i.e., `backtest` returns `None`), it executes the fallback strategy. Otherwise, it executes the original strategy.

Please replace the placeholder functions `backtest` and `fallback_strategy` with your actual functions.
