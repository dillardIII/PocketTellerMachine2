The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. 

Here is a simple Python code using the pandas library to generate a basic RSI trading strategy:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as web
import numpy as np

def calculate_rsi(data, window):
    delta = data.diff()
    up, down = delta.copy(), delta.copy()
    up[up < 0] = 0
    down[down > 0] = 0
    average_gain = up.rolling(window).mean()
    average_loss = abs(down.rolling(window).mean())
    rs = average_gain / average_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi

# Fetch historical data
data = web.DataReader('AAPL', 'yahoo', start='01-01-2020', end='12-31-2020')
data['RSI'] = calculate_rsi(data['Close'], 14)

# Define RSI strategy
def implement_rsi_strategy(data, low_rsi, high_rsi):
    data['Buy_Signal'] = np.where((data['RSI'] < low_rsi), 1, 0)
    data['Sell_Signal'] = np.where((data['RSI'] > high_rsi), -1, 0)
    return data

# Implement the strategy with 30 as the low RSI threshold and 70 as the high RSI threshold
data = implement_rsi_strategy(data, 30, 70)
```

In this code, we first define a function to calculate the RSI. We then fetch historical data for a specific stock (in this case, Apple) using the `pandas_datareader` library. We add the RSI to our data frame and then define our RSI strategy. If the RSI is below 30, we mark it as a buy signal, and if it's above 70, we mark it as a sell signal. Finally, we implement the strategy on our data. 

Please note that this is a very basic RSI strategy and may not be profitable in real trading. Always backtest your strategies before using them in live trading.
