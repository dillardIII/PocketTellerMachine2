To analyze market trends and patterns, we can use Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computation, and matplotlib for visualization. We also need to use a library like yfinance to download the stock data.

Here is a simple example of how you can do this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import yfinance as yf

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-1-25')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Calculate moving average
tickerDf['MA_50'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(50).mean()
tickerDf['MA_200'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(200).mean()

# Plot the close price and the moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.grid(True)
plt.plot(tickerDf['Close'],label='Close Price')
plt.plot(tickerDf['MA_50'], label='MA 50 days')
plt.plot(tickerDf['MA_200'], label='MA 200 days')
plt.legend(loc=2)
plt.show()

# Identify potential trading opportunities
buy_signals = (tickerDf['MA_50'] > tickerDf['MA_200']) & (tickerDf['MA_50'].shift(1) < tickerDf['MA_200'].shift(1))
sell_signals = (tickerDf['MA_50'] < tickerDf['MA_200']) & (tickerDf['MA_50'].shift(1) > tickerDf['MA_200'].shift(1))

# Print potential buy and sell dates
print('Potential Buy Dates:')
print(tickerDf.loc[buy_signals])

print('Potential Sell Dates:')
print(tickerDf.loc[sell_signals])
```

This script downloads the historical data for the specified ticker symbol, calculates the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and plots them. It then identifies potential buy signals (when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average) and sell signals (when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average).

Please note that this is a very basic example of trend analysis and should not be used for real trading decisions without further enhancements. For example, you might want to consider other factors like volume, other technical indicators, news events, etc. Also, this script does not take into account trading fees or slippage.
