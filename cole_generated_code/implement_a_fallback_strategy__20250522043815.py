Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume run_backtest is a function that runs the backtest and returns the results
    results = run_backtest(strategy)

    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Assume fallback_strategy is the alternative strategy to be used when no backtest results are found
        results = run_backtest(fallback_strategy)

    return results

# Now you can call the function with the strategy
strategy = "My Trading Strategy"
backtest_strategy(strategy)
```

In this code, we first try to run the backtest with the given strategy. If no results are found (i.e., `results` is `None` or an empty list), we print a message and then run the backtest again with a fallback strategy.

Please replace `run_backtest` and `fallback_strategy` with your actual backtest running function and fallback strategy. If your backtest running function or the way you check for no results is different, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.
