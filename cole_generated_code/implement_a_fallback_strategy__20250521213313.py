Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This example assumes that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that returns the backtest results, and a function called `fallback_strategy()` that is called when no backtest results are found.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    results = run_backtest()
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
        results = fallback_strategy()
    return results

def run_backtest():
    # Your code here to run the backtest
    # This is just a placeholder
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your code here for the fallback strategy
    # This is just a placeholder
    return "Fallback results"

# Test the function
print(get_backtest_results())
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results()` first tries to get the backtest results by calling `run_backtest()`. If no results are found (i.e., if `results` is `None` or an empty list), it prints a message and then calls `fallback_strategy()` to get the fallback results. The function then returns the results, whether they're from the original backtest or the fallback strategy.

Please replace the `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` functions with your actual implementation.
