To conduct a market analysis, we would need to have access to a database or API that provides us with real-time or historical market data. For this example, I will use the `yfinance` library, which allows us to download stock price data from Yahoo Finance.

Here's a simple Python script that downloads the latest stock price data for a given list of tickers, calculates the percentage change over the last day, and identifies stocks that have increased or decreased by more than a certain threshold. 

Please note that this is a very basic form of market analysis and may not be sufficient for making actual trading decisions.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# List of stock tickers to analyze
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'FB']

# Download latest stock price data
data = yf.download(tickers, period='1d', interval='1m')

# Calculate percentage change over the last day
data['Change'] = data['Adj Close'].pct_change()

# Define thresholds for significant increase/decrease
increase_threshold = 0.05  # 5% increase
decrease_threshold = -0.05  # 5% decrease

# Identify potential trading opportunities
increases = data[data['Change'] > increase_threshold]
decreases = data[data['Change'] < decrease_threshold]

# Print results
print("Potential trading opportunities for the next day:")
print("Stocks with significant increases:")
print(increases)
print("Stocks with significant decreases:")
print(decreases)
```

This script will print out the stocks that have increased or decreased by more than 5% over the last day. You can adjust the list of tickers and the thresholds as needed.

Please note that this script assumes that you have the `yfinance` and `pandas` libraries installed. If you don't, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas
```
