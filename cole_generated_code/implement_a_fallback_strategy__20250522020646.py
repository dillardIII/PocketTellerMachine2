Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume `run_backtest` is a function that runs a backtest for a given strategy
    # and returns a dictionary with the results.
    results = run_backtest(strategy)

    # If no results are found, implement the fallback strategy.
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        return {}

    return results

def run_backtest(strategy):
    # This is just a placeholder for the actual backtesting code.
    # In the real function, you'd run the backtest and return the results.
    # For this example, let's assume that no results are found.
    return None

# Test the function with a strategy.
strategy = "Buy and hold"
print(backtest_strategy(strategy))
```

In this example, the `run_backtest` function is a placeholder for the actual backtesting code. You'd need to replace it with the real backtesting code. The `backtest_strategy` function runs the backtest and checks if any results are found. If no results are found, it implements the fallback strategy, which in this case is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.
