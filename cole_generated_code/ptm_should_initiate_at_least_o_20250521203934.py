Sure, I can help you with that. However, I need to clarify that trading involves risks and there's no guaranteed way to always make a profit. Here's a simple Python code that uses a fictional trading API to initiate a trade. 

```python
import random
import requests

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_url = "http://trading-api.com"  # This is a fictional API

    def initiate_trade(self):
        # Randomly choose a stock to trade
        stock = random.choice(['AAPL', 'GOOG', 'TSLA', 'AMZN'])

        # Randomly decide whether to buy or sell
        action = random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])

        # Randomly decide the quantity to buy/sell
        quantity = random.randint(1, 100)

        # Construct the API endpoint
        endpoint = f"{self.base_url}/trade"

        # Construct the payload
        payload = {
            'stock': stock,
            'action': action,
            'quantity': quantity
        }

        # Make the API request
        response = requests.post(endpoint, json=payload)

        # Check the response
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print(f"Trade initiated: {action} {quantity} shares of {stock}")
        else:
            print("Failed to initiate trade")

# Create an instance of PTM
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
ptm.initiate_trade()
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example. Real-world trading involves more complex considerations and strategies. Also, the trading API used here is fictional. In a real-world scenario, you would need to use a real trading API (like Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, etc.) and you would need to handle authentication, error checking, and other important aspects.
