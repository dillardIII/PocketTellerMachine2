As an AI model, I can't execute trades, but I can help you write a Python code that simulates a trading activity. Here's a simple example of how you might do this using a hypothetical trading API:

```python
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class TradingAPI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stocks = ['AAPL', 'GOOG', 'TSLA', 'AMZN']

    def get_price(self, stock):
        # This is a mock function. In real life, it would get the current price of the stock.
        return random.uniform(100.0, 500.0)

    def buy(self, stock, quantity):
        price = self.get_price(stock)
        print(f"Bought {quantity} of {stock} at {price}")
        return quantity * price

    def sell(self, stock, quantity):
        price = self.get_price(stock)
        print(f"Sold {quantity} of {stock} at {price}")
        return quantity * price

def execute_trade():
    api = TradingAPI()

    # Choose a random stock to trade
    stock = random.choice(api.stocks)

    # Decide randomly whether to buy or sell
    action = random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])

    # Choose a random quantity to trade
    quantity = random.randint(1, 10)

    if action == 'buy':
        api.buy(stock, quantity)
    else:
        api.sell(stock, quantity)

# Schedule the trade for tomorrow
tomorrow = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1)
while datetime.now() < tomorrow:
    continue

execute_trade()
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example and doesn't represent how you would do this in a real-world application. For instance, in a real application, you would need to handle authentication with the trading API, error handling, and much more. You would also need to use an actual scheduling library to schedule the trade for tomorrow, rather than using a busy-wait loop as shown here.
