Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. 

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    try:
        # Try to get backtest results
        backtest_results = strategy.backtest()
        
        # If no results found, raise an exception
        if not backtest_results:
            raise Exception('No backtest results found')
        
        return backtest_results

    except Exception as e:
        print(str(e))
        
        # Fallback strategy
        print("Implementing fallback strategy...")
        
        fallback_results = strategy.fallback_strategy()
        
        return fallback_results

# Assuming we have a strategy object
strategy = Strategy()

# Call the backtest function
results = backtest_strategy(strategy)
```

This code tries to backtest a given strategy. If no backtest results are found (i.e., the backtest results are None or empty), it raises an exception. This exception is caught and the fallback strategy is implemented. 

Please note that the actual implementation of `backtest` and `fallback_strategy` methods depends on your specific trading strategy and system. This is a general structure of how you can handle such a situation.
