Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found:

```python
class TradingAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.backtest_results = None

    def perform_backtest(self):
        # Code to perform backtest goes here
        # This is a placeholder as the actual code would depend on the specific backtest being performed
        pass

    def fallback_strategy(self):
        # Code for fallback strategy goes here
        # This is a placeholder as the actual code would depend on the specific fallback strategy
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")

    def execute_strategy(self):
        if self.backtest_results is None:
            self.fallback_strategy()
        else:
            # Code to execute strategy based on backtest results goes here
            pass

assistant = TradingAssistant()
assistant.execute_strategy()
```

In this code, `TradingAssistant` is a class that represents the trading assistant. It has a method `perform_backtest` to perform the backtest, a method `fallback_strategy` to implement the fallback strategy, and a method `execute_strategy` to execute the strategy based on the backtest results.

If no backtest results are found (i.e., `self.backtest_results` is `None`), the `fallback_strategy` is called. Otherwise, the strategy based on the backtest results is executed.

Please replace the `pass` statements with the actual code to perform the backtest and implement the strategies.
