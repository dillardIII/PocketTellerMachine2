The details provided in your request are a bit sparse. However, I can take an educated guess and provide you a skeleton for improving a simple algorithmic trading system using Python. The 'proactive approach' could mean many things, but I assume it means to be able to identify and act opportunities faster here.

Here's basic Python code utilizing pandas for data manipulation and yfinance to download stocks data. I use Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover strategy for demonstration. 

This code will need to be customized to fit the specific needs of your trading strategy, including but not limited to other trading strategies, risk management, different financial instruments, etc.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    return data.rolling(window=window).mean()

def calculate_signals(df):
    short_window = 40
    long_window = 100

    # create short simple moving average over the short window
    df['short_mavg'] = calculate_sma(df['Close'], short_window)

    # create long simple moving average over the long window
    df['long_mavg'] = calculate_sma(df['Close'], long_window)

    # create signals
    df['signal'] = 0.0
    df.loc[df['short_mavg'] > df['long_mavg'], 'signal'] = 1.0

    return df

def backtest(df):
    # set initial capital
    initial_capital = float(100000.0)

    # create a DataFrame 'positions'
    positions = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index).fillna(0.0)

    # buy a 100 shares
    positions['AAPL'] = 100 * df['signal']

    # initialize the portfolio with value owned
    portfolio = positions.multiply(df['Adj Close'], axis=0)

    # store the difference in shares owned
    pos_diff = positions.diff()

    # add 'holdings' to portfolio
    portfolio['holdings'] = (positions.multiply(df['Adj Close'], axis=0)).sum(axis=1)

    # add 'cash' to portfolio
    portfolio['cash'] = initial_capital - (pos_diff.multiply(df['Adj Close'], axis=0)).sum(axis=1).cumsum()

    # add 'total' to portfolio
    portfolio['total'] = portfolio['cash'] + portfolio['holdings']

    # add 'returns' to portfolio
    portfolio['returns'] = portfolio['total'].pct_change()

    return portfolio

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download("AAPL", start="2020-01-01", end="2022-11-30")

# Compute the signals
signals = calculate_signals(data)

# Execute the backtest
results = backtest(signals)

print(results)
```
This is just a very basic example of a trading algorithm. A real-world trading algorithm includes much more complex calculations and advanced strategies. So just treat it as a starting point.

Some other aspects you may want to consider adding:
- Implementation of other technical indicators
- Risk management (stop-loss, take-profit)
- Real time data handling
- Transaction cost consideration
- Methods to optimize the performance
- Multiple securities trading simultaneously
- Machine learning for prediction
- Portfolio optimization
