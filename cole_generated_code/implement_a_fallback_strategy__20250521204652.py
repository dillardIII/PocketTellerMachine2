Sure, here's a simple way to implement a fallback strategy using Python. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` which runs the backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, it will run a fallback function `run_fallback()`.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    # This function should return the backtest results if successful, or None if no results were found
    pass

def run_fallback():
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")
    # Your fallback strategy code here
    pass

def main():
    backtest_results = run_backtest()
    if backtest_results is None:
        run_fallback()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found:", backtest_results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please replace the `run_backtest()` and `run_fallback()` functions with your actual backtest and fallback strategy code. The `main()` function will run the backtest and check the results. If no results are found, it will run the fallback strategy.
