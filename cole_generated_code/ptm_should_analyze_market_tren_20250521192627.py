To complete this task, you would need to use a Python library like pandas for data analysis and manipulation, and yfinance to download the historical market data from Yahoo Finance. For simplicity, let's assume we're analyzing the market trends and patterns for a single stock.

Here's a simple Python script that downloads the historical data for a specific stock symbol, calculates its moving averages, and identifies potential trading opportunities based on these averages:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate the short-term and long-term moving averages
data['Short_SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['Long_SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create a function to signal when to buy and sell an asset
def identify_opportunities(data):
    buy_signal = []
    sell_signal = []
    
    for i in range(len(data)):
        if data['Short_SMA'].iloc[i] > data['Long_SMA'].iloc[i]:
            if len(buy_signal) > 0:
                if sell_signal[-1] > buy_signal[-1]:
                    buy_signal.append(data['Close'].iloc[i])
                    sell_signal.append(np.nan)
                else:
                    buy_signal.append(np.nan)
                    sell_signal.append(np.nan)
            else:
                buy_signal.append(data['Close'].iloc[i])
                sell_signal.append(np.nan)
        elif data['Short_SMA'].iloc[i] < data['Long_SMA'].iloc[i]:
            if len(sell_signal) > 0:
                if buy_signal[-1] > sell_signal[-1]:
                    sell_signal.append(data['Close'].iloc[i])
                    buy_signal.append(np.nan)
                else:
                    buy_signal.append(np.nan)
                    sell_signal.append(np.nan)
            else:
                sell_signal.append(data['Close'].iloc[i])
                buy_signal.append(np.nan)
        else:
            buy_signal.append(np.nan)
            sell_signal.append(np.nan)
            
    return (buy_signal, sell_signal)

# Add the buy and sell signals to the data
data['Buy_Signal_Price'] = identify_opportunities(data)[0]
data['Sell_Signal_Price'] = identify_opportunities(data)[1]

# Print the data
print(data)
```

This script identifies potential trading opportunities based on the crossover of the short-term and long-term moving averages, which is a common trading strategy. When the short-term average crosses above the long-term average, it generates a buy signal, and when it crosses below, it generates a sell signal.

Please note that this is a very basic script and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex, taking into account many other factors and using more sophisticated statistical methods.
