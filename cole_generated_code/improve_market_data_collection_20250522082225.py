To improve market data collection for better decision-making, we can use Python's libraries such as pandas, yfinance, and matplotlib. Here's a simple example of how we can collect and visualize stock market data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'GOOGL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Visualize the data
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
plt.plot(tickerDf['Close'])
plt.title('Historical Stock Value')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Stock Price')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This code will collect the historical prices for Google's stock (GOOGL) from 2010 to 2020, print the data, and then plot the closing prices. You can replace 'GOOGL' with any other valid ticker symbol to get data for that stock.

Please note that this is a simple example and real-world market data collection might involve collecting data from multiple sources, handling missing data, and more complex analysis.
