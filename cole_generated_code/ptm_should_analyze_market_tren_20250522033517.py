Unfortunately, writing a Python code for a Pattern Trend Machine (PTM) that analyzes market trends and patterns to identify potential trading opportunities is a complex task that requires extensive knowledge and experience in both finance and machine learning. However, I can provide you with a simple example of how you can start building such a system using Python and pandas library. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world financial systems are much more complex and require a lot of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and sophisticated algorithms.

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# Download historical data as dataframe
df = pdr.get_data_yahoo("AAPL", start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

# Calculate moving averages
df['SMA_5'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=5).mean()
df['SMA_20'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Define a simple strategy
df['Buy_Signal'] = (df['SMA_5'] > df['SMA_20']).astype(int)
df['Sell_Signal'] = (df['SMA_5'] < df['SMA_20']).astype(int)

# Identify potential trading opportunities
buy_signals = df[df['Buy_Signal'] == 1]
sell_signals = df[df['Sell_Signal'] == 1]

print("Potential Buy Signals:\n", buy_signals)
print("Potential Sell Signals:\n", sell_signals)
```

This code will download the historical data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance, calculate the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), and generate buy/sell signals based on the crossover strategy (buy when the 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, and sell when it's below).

Please note that this is a very simple strategy and might not be profitable in real trading. You should always backtest your strategies before using them in live trading.
