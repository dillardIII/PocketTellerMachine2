To analyze market trends and opportunities, we will need to use some kind of data analysis or machine learning library. In this case, we will use pandas for data analysis and yfinance to download the stock data. 

Here is a simple Python code to analyze market trends:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

# Use yfinance while pandas datareader is not working
yf.pdr_override()

# Input the stock you want to analyze
stock = input("Enter a stock ticker: ")
df = pdr.get_data_yahoo(stock, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

# Calculate moving averages
df['MA10'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
df['MA50'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a function to signal when to buy and sell an asset
def buy_sell(signal):
    Buy = []
    Sell = []
    flag = -1

    for i in range(0, len(signal)):
        if signal['MA10'][i] > signal['MA50'][i]:
            Sell.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 1:
                Buy.append(signal['Close'][i])
                flag = 1
            else:
                Buy.append(np.nan)
        elif signal['MA10'][i] < signal['MA50'][i]:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 0:
                Sell.append(signal['Close'][i])
                flag = 0
            else:
                Sell.append(np.nan)
        else:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            Sell.append(np.nan)

    return (Buy, Sell)

# Create buy and sell column
df['Buy_Signal_Price'] = buy_sell(df)[0]
df['Sell_Signal_Price'] = buy_sell(df)[1]

# Print the dataframe
print(df)
```

This code will calculate the 10-day and 50-day moving averages for the stock. When the 10-day moving average is greater than the 50-day moving average, it's a signal to buy. When the 50-day moving average is greater than the 10-day moving average, it's a signal to sell.

Please note that this is a very simple trading strategy and real-life trading involves many more factors. Always do your own research before making any trading decisions.
