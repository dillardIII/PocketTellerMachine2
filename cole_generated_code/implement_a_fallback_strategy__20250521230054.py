Sure, here's a basic example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python when no backtest results are found. This example assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that returns the backtest results or `None` if no results are found, and a function `fallback_strategy()` that should be run if no backtest results are found.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
        results = fallback_strategy()
    return results

def run_backtest():
    # Your code to run the backtest goes here.
    # This is just a placeholder.
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your code for the fallback strategy goes here.
    # This is just a placeholder.
    return "Fallback results"

# Test the function
print(get_backtest_results())
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results()` first tries to get the backtest results by calling `run_backtest()`. If `run_backtest()` returns `None`, indicating that no results were found, it then runs the fallback strategy by calling `fallback_strategy()`. The results of the fallback strategy are then returned.
