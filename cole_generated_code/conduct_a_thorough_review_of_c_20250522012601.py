To complete this task, we would need to use a Python library like pandas_datareader to fetch data from a financial market data provider like Yahoo Finance. We would also use pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for data visualization. However, please note that this is a simplified version of a very complex process and in real-world trading, more sophisticated models and algorithms are used.

Here is a simple Python code to fetch the last 60 days' data for a specific stock (for example, Apple Inc.) and calculate its moving average:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader.data as web
import datetime
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the date range
end = datetime.datetime.now()
start = end - datetime.timedelta(days=60)

# Fetch the data from Yahoo Finance
df = web.DataReader('AAPL', 'yahoo', start, end)

# Calculate the moving average
df['Moving Average'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Plot the closing price and the moving average
df[['Close', 'Moving Average']].plot(figsize=(10,5))
plt.grid(True)
plt.title('Moving Average for AAPL')
plt.axis('tight')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.show()
```

This code will plot the closing price and the moving average for Apple Inc. for the last 60 days. A potential trading opportunity could be identified if the closing price crosses the moving average.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and real-world trading involves more complex strategies and risk management. Also, this code does not take into account trading costs, slippage, etc.
