Sure, I can provide a simple example of how you might initiate a trade using Python. This example will use the `yfinance` library to fetch stock data and the `alpaca_trade_api` library to initiate the trade. 

Please note that you'll need to replace `'APCA-API-KEY-ID'` and `'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY'` with your actual Alpaca API key and secret. Also, this is a simple example and doesn't include any logic for when or why to initiate a trade. 

```python
import yfinance as yf
from alpaca_trade_api import REST

# Define Alpaca API and Secret Keys
api = REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Define the stock to trade
symbol = 'AAPL'

# Fetch current price
current_price = yf.Ticker(symbol).info['regularMarketPrice']

# Define the quantity to trade
quantity = 1

# Initiate a buy order
api.submit_order(
    symbol=symbol,
    qty=quantity,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This script will initiate a buy order for 1 share of Apple stock at the current market price. 

Please remember that trading involves risk and this script does not include any risk management or strategy for choosing when to buy or sell. It is crucial to develop a well-tested strategy before live trading.
