Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this example, I'll assume that `backtest()` is a function that performs the backtest and returns the results if they exist, and `fallback_strategy()` is a function that implements the fallback strategy.

```python
def perform_backtest():
    try:
        results = backtest()
        if results is None:
            raise Exception("No backtest results found")
        return results
    except Exception as e:
        print(str(e))
        print("Implementing fallback strategy...")
        return fallback_strategy()

def backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your fallback strategy code here
    pass
```

In this code, `perform_backtest()` tries to perform the backtest and return the results. If no results are found (i.e., `backtest()` returns `None`), it raises an exception. This exception is caught, and the fallback strategy is implemented instead.

Please replace the `backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` functions with your actual backtest and fallback strategy implementations.
