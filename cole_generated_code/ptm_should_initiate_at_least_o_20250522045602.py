Sure, here is a simple Python code to simulate a trade using a hypothetical stock. This code does not represent real-world trading and is only for illustrative purposes. In reality, you would use a trading API to execute trades.

```python
import datetime
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, symbol, quantity):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.price = None
        self.time = None

    def execute_trade(self):
        # In reality, you would use a trading API to get the actual price
        self.price = random.uniform(10.0, 200.0)  # Simulate price with a random number
        self.time = datetime.datetime.now()  # Get the current time
        return self.price * self.quantity  # Return the total cost of the trade

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []
        self.funds = 10000.0  # Starting funds

    def initiate_trade(self, symbol, quantity):
        trade = Trade(symbol, quantity)
        cost = trade.execute_trade()
        if cost > self.funds:
            print("Insufficient funds for trade.")
            return
        self.trades.append(trade)
        self.funds -= cost
        print(f"Trade executed: Bought {quantity} of {symbol} at {trade.price} each. Total cost: {cost}. Remaining funds: {self.funds}")

    def evaluate_performance(self):
        total_spent = sum(trade.price * trade.quantity for trade in self.trades)
        average_price = total_spent / sum(trade.quantity for trade in self.trades)
        print(f"Total spent on trades: {total_spent}. Average price per stock: {average_price}.")

ptm = PTM()
ptm.initiate_trade("AAPL", 5)
ptm.evaluate_performance()
```

This code creates a PTM (Portfolio Trading Manager) that can initiate trades and evaluate performance. The `initiate_trade` method creates a new `Trade` object, executes the trade, and adds it to the list of trades. The `evaluate_performance` method calculates the total amount spent on trades and the average price per stock.
