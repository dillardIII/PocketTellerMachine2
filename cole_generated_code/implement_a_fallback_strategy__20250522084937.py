Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, I'm assuming that the backtest results are normally stored in a list. If the list is empty, the fallback strategy will be executed.

```python
def backtest_strategy():
    # This is where your backtest strategy would be implemented
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is where your fallback strategy would be implemented
    print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")

def execute_strategy():
    backtest_results = []

    # Normally, backtest_results would be populated with the results of your backtest strategy
    backtest_strategy()

    if len(backtest_results) == 0:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Process backtest results
        pass

execute_strategy()
```

In this code, `backtest_strategy()` is a placeholder for your backtest strategy. If the backtest results list remains empty after this function is called, the `fallback_strategy()` function is called instead. You would replace these placeholder functions with your actual strategies.
