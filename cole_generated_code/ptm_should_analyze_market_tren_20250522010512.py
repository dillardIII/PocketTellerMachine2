To complete this task, we'll need to use Python libraries that can handle data analysis and machine learning. Here's a basic example of how you could set up a system to analyze market trends and adjust trading approach. This example uses the pandas library for data handling and the sklearn library for machine learning.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Load market data
# This could be a CSV file or data from a database
# For this example, let's assume it's a CSV file with 'Date' and 'Price' columns
market_data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Convert 'Date' column to datetime
market_data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(market_data['Date'])

# Sort data by date
market_data = market_data.sort_values('Date')

# Use previous prices to predict future prices
market_data['Previous_Price'] = market_data['Price'].shift()

# Drop the first row which does not have a previous price
market_data = market_data.dropna()

# Split data into features (X) and target (y)
X = market_data['Previous_Price'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = market_data['Price']

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions using the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy of the model
print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))
print('Mean Squared Error:', metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
print('Root Mean Squared Error:', np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)))

# If the error is acceptable, use the model to predict future prices and adjust trading approach
```

This is a very basic example and might not be suitable for real-world trading. In reality, you'd likely need to take into account many more factors and use more complex models.
