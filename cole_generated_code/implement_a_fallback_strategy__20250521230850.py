Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to simply print a message and return an empty dictionary. You can replace this with your own fallback strategy.

```python
def get_backtest_results(backtest_id):
    # Simulate getting backtest results from some API or database
    backtest_results = {}  # Assume no results found

    # If no results found, implement fallback strategy
    if not backtest_results:
        print(f"No backtest results found for ID: {backtest_id}")
        # Fallback strategy: return an empty dictionary
        return {}

    return backtest_results

# Test the function
print(get_backtest_results(123))
```

This code is just a simulation. In a real-world scenario, you would replace the line where `backtest_results` is defined with actual code to fetch backtest results from an API or a database. The fallback strategy would also likely be more complex, possibly involving re-running the backtest or fetching results from a backup source.
