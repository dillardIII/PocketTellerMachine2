To analyze market trends and identify potential trading opportunities, we can use Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download the stock data, and matplotlib for visualization. 

Here is a simple Python code that uses moving average strategy to identify potential trading opportunities:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
def download_data(stock, start, end):
    data = {}
    ticker = yf.download(stock, start, end)
    data['Price'] = ticker['Adj Close']
    return pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate moving averages
def calculate_MA(data, short_window, long_window):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['Price'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['Price'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()
    return signals

# Plot the data
def plot_data(data, signals):
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111, ylabel='Price in $')
    data["Price"].plot(ax=ax1, color='r', lw=2.)
    signals[['short_mavg', 'long_mavg']].plot(ax=ax1, lw=2.)
    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == 1.0].index, signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == 1.0], '^' , markersize=10, color='m')
    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == -1.0].index, signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == -1.0], 'v' , markersize=10, color='k')
    plt.show()

# Define the ticker symbol and the period for which we want to download the data
stock = 'AAPL'
start_date = '01-01-2020'
end_date = '01-01-2022'

# Define the short and long moving windows
short_window = 40
long_window = 100

# Download the data
data = download_data(stock, start_date, end_date)

# Calculate the moving averages
signals = calculate_MA(data, short_window, long_window)

# Plot the data
plot_data(data, signals)
```

In this code, we are using a simple moving average crossover strategy. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it generates a buy signal. Conversely, when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, it generates a sell signal. 

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and may not always work as expected. You should use it as a starting point and build more sophisticated strategies, possibly incorporating more indicators and machine learning models.
