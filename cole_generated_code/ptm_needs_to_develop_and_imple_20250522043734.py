Sure, I can provide a basic Python code structure for developing trading strategies. However, please note that this is a simplified version and real trading strategies can be extremely complex, involving advanced mathematical models and machine learning algorithms. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load your trading data
# This is a placeholder, replace it with your actual data
data = pd.read_csv('trading_data.csv')

# Split the data into features and target
# This is a placeholder, replace 'feature1', 'feature2', 'target' with your actual features and target
features = data[['feature1', 'feature2']]
target = data['target']

# Split the data into training set and test set
features_train, features_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define the trading strategy
# This is a placeholder, replace it with your actual trading strategy
def trading_strategy(features, target):
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(features, target)
    return model

# Implement the trading strategy
strategy = trading_strategy(features_train, target_train)

# Test the trading strategy
predictions = strategy.predict(features_test)

# Evaluate the trading strategy
# This is a placeholder, replace it with your actual evaluation metric
score = strategy.score(features_test, target_test)
print(f'The score of the trading strategy is: {score}')
```

This code is a basic example of a trading strategy using linear regression. It first loads the trading data, then splits it into features and target. It defines a trading strategy which is a linear regression model in this case. It then implements the trading strategy by fitting the model with the training data. It tests the trading strategy by predicting the target for the test data. Finally, it evaluates the trading strategy by calculating the score of the model.
