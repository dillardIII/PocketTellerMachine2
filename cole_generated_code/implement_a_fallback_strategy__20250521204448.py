Sure, I can help with that. However, I'll need a bit more context to provide a more accurate solution. For now, I'll assume that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that returns backtest results and that you want to implement a fallback strategy when no results are returned.

Here's a simple Python code snippet that implements this:

```python
def fallback_strategy():
    # Implement your fallback strategy here
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")

def main():
    backtest_results = run_backtest()

    if not backtest_results:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Process backtest results
        print("Backtest results found. Processing...")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` is a placeholder for your actual backtesting function. If this function returns `None` or an empty list (i.e., no results), the `fallback_strategy()` function is called.

Please replace the `fallback_strategy()` and `run_backtest()` functions with your actual functions and logic.
