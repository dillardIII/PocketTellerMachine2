Sure, here is a simple example of how you might initiate a trade using a Python library like `ccxt` which is used for cryptocurrency trading. Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading involves much more considerations like handling failures, managing balances, etc.

```python
import ccxt

# Instantiate the exchange
exchange = ccxt.binance({
    'apiKey': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    'secret': 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
})

# Define the market and amount
market = 'BTC/USDT'
amount = 0.001

# Fetch the current price
ticker = exchange.fetch_ticker(market)
price = ticker['last']

# Create a limit buy order
order = exchange.create_limit_buy_order(market, amount, price)

print(order)
```

This script will create a limit buy order for 0.001 BTC at the current market price on the Binance exchange. You need to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` and `'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'` with your actual API key and secret key.

Please note that trading involves risk and you should only trade with what you can afford to lose.
