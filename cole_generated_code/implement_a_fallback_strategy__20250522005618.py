Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This example assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs a backtest and returns the results, or `None` if no results are found. The fallback strategy here is to simply print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Falling back to default strategy.")
        return {}
    else:
        return results

def run_backtest():
    # This is a placeholder for your actual backtest function.
    # It should return the backtest results, or None if no results are found.
    pass
```

You can replace the `print` statement and the empty dictionary with whatever fallback strategy you want to implement. For example, you might want to run a different backtest, return some default results, or raise an exception.
