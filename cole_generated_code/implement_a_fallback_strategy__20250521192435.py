Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found:

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Run backtest
    results = strategy.run_backtest()

    # Check if results are empty
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Implement fallback strategy
        fallback_strategy = FallbackStrategy()
        fallback_results = fallback_strategy.run_backtest()

        # Check if fallback results are also empty
        if not fallback_results:
            print("No results found even with fallback strategy. Please check the strategies.")
            return None
        else:
            return fallback_results
    else:
        return results
```

In this code, `strategy` and `FallbackStrategy` are placeholders for your actual strategy and fallback strategy objects. The `run_backtest` method is also a placeholder for the method that you would use to run the backtest on the strategy. If no results are found, the code implements a fallback strategy and returns its results. If the fallback strategy also fails to produce results, the function returns `None` and prints an error message.
