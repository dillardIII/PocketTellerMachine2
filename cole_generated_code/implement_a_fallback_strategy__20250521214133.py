Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the function will return a message saying "No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy."

```python
def backtest_strategy(data):
    # Assuming data is a list of backtest results
    if len(data) == 0:
        return "No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy."
    else:
        # Process the backtest results
        # This is just a placeholder. In real code, you would have some logic here to handle the backtest results.
        return "Backtest results processed."

# Test the function with some data
print(backtest_strategy([]))  # Should print "No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy."
```

This is a very basic example. Depending on your specific needs, your fallback strategy could involve more complex actions, such as running a different type of backtest, using a default set of results, or raising an error.
