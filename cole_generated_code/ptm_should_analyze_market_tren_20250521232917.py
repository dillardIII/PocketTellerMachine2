This task requires a lot of data analysis and machine learning knowledge. Here is a simple example of how you might start to analyze market trends and patterns using Python. This example uses the pandas and yfinance libraries to fetch stock data and analyze it.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Fetch historical market data for a specific stock
data = yf.download('AAPL','2016-01-01','2021-12-31')

# Calculate the moving average
data['SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=14).mean()
data['EMA'] = data['Close'].ewm(span=14, adjust=False).mean()

# Define the predictor variables and target variable
X = data[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume', 'SMA', 'EMA']].dropna()
y = data['Close'][X.index]

# Split the data into training set and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy of the model
print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions))  
print('Mean Squared Error:', metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))  
print('Root Mean Squared Error:', np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)))
```

This is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex. They would likely use more advanced machine learning models and take into account many more factors.
