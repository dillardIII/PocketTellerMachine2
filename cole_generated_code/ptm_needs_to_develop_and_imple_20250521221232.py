Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic trading strategy. This strategy will be based on moving averages, a common indicator used in trading. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading strategies are much more complex and take into account many more factors. Also, trading involves significant risk and should only be done after thorough research and consideration.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL' # Apple Inc.

# Gather data from Yahoo Finance
data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickerSymbol, start="2020-01-01", end="2021-12-31")

# Calculate short-term simple moving average
short_sma = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate long-term simple moving average
long_sma = data['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create a column in the data dataframe to hold the trading signals
data['signal'] = 0.0

# Generate trading signals based on the crossover of the short-term and long-term moving averages
data['signal'][short_sma > long_sma] = 1.0

# Calculate daily returns
data['daily_returns'] = data['Close'].pct_change()

# Calculate strategy returns
data['strategy_returns'] = data['daily_returns'] * data['signal'].shift()

# Calculate cumulative returns
data['cumulative_returns'] = (1 + data['strategy_returns']).cumprod()

# Print the dataframe
print(data)
```

This script downloads historical price data for Apple Inc. from Yahoo Finance, calculates the short-term (20 days) and long-term (100 days) simple moving averages, generates trading signals based on the crossover of these moving averages (buy when the short-term average is above the long-term average, sell otherwise), calculates the daily and strategy returns, and finally the cumulative returns of the strategy.
