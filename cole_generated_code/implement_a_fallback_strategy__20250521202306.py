Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found:

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume that we have a function called backtest that takes a strategy
    # and returns the backtest results or None if no results are found
    backtest_results = backtest(strategy)

    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found for the strategy.")
        print("Implementing fallback strategy...")

        # Assume that we have a function called fallback_strategy
        # that implements the fallback strategy
        fallback_results = fallback_strategy()

        return fallback_results

    return backtest_results

# Testing the function with a strategy
strategy = "Strategy 1"
results = backtest_strategy(strategy)
```

This code assumes that you have two functions: `backtest` and `fallback_strategy`. The `backtest` function takes a strategy as an argument and returns the backtest results or `None` if no results are found. The `fallback_strategy` function implements the fallback strategy and returns its results.

Please replace these function calls with your actual implementation. Also, you may want to handle the case when the fallback strategy also fails to produce results.
