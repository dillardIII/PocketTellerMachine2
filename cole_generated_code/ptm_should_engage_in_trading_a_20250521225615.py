To simulate trading activities, we can create a simple Python script that generates random wins and losses for PTM. Here's a simple example:

```python
import random

def simulate_trading(days=1):
    results = []
    for _ in range(days):
        # Assume that the chance of winning is 50%
        win = random.choice([True, False])
        if win:
            # If win, the profit is a random number between 1 and 100
            profit = random.randint(1, 100)
        else:
            # If lose, the loss is a random number between 1 and 100
            profit = -random.randint(1, 100)
        results.append(profit)
    return results

# Simulate trading activities for tomorrow
tomorrow_trading_results = simulate_trading()

print(tomorrow_trading_results)
```

This script will simulate trading activities for tomorrow and print the results. Each result is either a positive number (which represents a win) or a negative number (which represents a loss). The magnitude of the number represents the amount of the win or loss.

Please note that this is a very simplified simulation. Real-world trading involves many more factors and is much more complex.
