Sure, here is a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python when no backtest results are found. In this example, I assume that the backtest function returns None when no results are found.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest function
    # It should return the backtest results if they exist, and None otherwise
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your fallback strategy
    # It should be executed when no backtest results are found
    print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy.")

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Continue with your normal strategy execution using the results
        pass

# Execute a strategy
execute_strategy("your_strategy")
```

In this code, `execute_strategy` first tries to get the backtest results. If the results are not found (i.e., `backtest` returns `None`), it executes the fallback strategy. Otherwise, it continues with the normal strategy execution. You would need to replace the `backtest` and `fallback_strategy` functions with your actual functions.
