Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python:

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This function is a placeholder for your actual backtest function
    # It should return the backtest results if they exist, otherwise None
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function is a placeholder for your fallback strategy
    # It should be executed when no backtest results are found
    pass

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    # Execute the backtest
    results = backtest(strategy)

    # If no results are found, execute the fallback strategy
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found. Executing strategy.")
        # Here you would normally do something with the results, like executing the strategy

# Example usage:
execute_strategy("my_strategy")
```

This is a very basic example and you would need to replace the placeholder functions with your actual functions. Also, you might want to handle errors and exceptions depending on your specific needs.
