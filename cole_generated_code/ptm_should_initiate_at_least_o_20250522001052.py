Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. Please note that this is a simulation and doesn't involve real trading. For real trading, you would need to use a trading platform's API.

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, ticker, quantity, price):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.price = price

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []
        self.balance = 10000  # initial balance

    def initiate_trade(self, trade):
        cost = trade.quantity * trade.price
        if cost > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient balance for this trade.")
            return
        self.trades.append(trade)
        self.balance -= cost
        print(f"Trade initiated: Bought {trade.quantity} shares of {trade.ticker} at {trade.price} each.")

# Example usage:
ptm = PTM()
trade = Trade("AAPL", 10, 150)  # Assume we are buying 10 shares of AAPL at $150 each
ptm.initiate_trade(trade)
```

This code defines two classes: `Trade` and `PTM`. `Trade` represents a trade with a ticker symbol, quantity, and price. `PTM` represents a trading manager, which can initiate trades and keeps track of the balance and the trades it has made. The `initiate_trade` method checks if the balance is sufficient for the trade, and if so, it adds the trade to its list of trades and deducts the cost from the balance.
