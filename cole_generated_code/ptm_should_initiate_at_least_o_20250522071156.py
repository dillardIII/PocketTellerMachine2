Sure, here's a simple example of how you might initiate a trade using Python. This example uses the `yfinance` library to fetch stock data and the `alpaca_trade_api` library to initiate the trade. 

Please replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your actual Alpaca API keys.

```python
import yfinance as yf
from alpaca_trade_api import REST

# Define your API keys
APCA_API_BASE_URL = "https://paper-api.alpaca.markets"
APCA_API_KEY_ID = "APCA-API-KEY-ID"
APCA_API_SECRET_KEY = "APCA-API-SECRET-KEY"

# Initialize Alpaca API
api = REST(APCA_API_KEY_ID, APCA_API_SECRET_KEY, APCA_API_BASE_URL, api_version='v2')

# Define the stock to trade
stock = 'AAPL'

# Fetch the stock data
data = yf.download(stock, period='1d', interval='1m')

# Get the last price
last_price = data['Close'][-1]

# Define the number of shares to buy
shares = 1

# Initiate the trade
api.submit_order(
    symbol=stock,
    qty=shares,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc',
)

print(f"Successfully initiated a trade to buy {shares} shares of {stock} at {last_price}")
```

This script will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of AAPL at the current market price. Note that this is a very basic example and doesn't include any kind of trading strategy. In a real-world scenario, you would likely want to use a more sophisticated approach to decide when and what to trade.
