Sure, I'll write a simple Python code that simulates a trading bot. This bot will initiate a trade when a certain condition is met. For simplicity, let's assume that we are trading stocks and we initiate a trade when the price of a stock goes below a certain threshold.

```python
class TradingBot:
    def __init__(self, threshold):
        self.threshold = threshold

    def trade(self, current_price):
        if current_price < self.threshold:
            self.buy_stock()
        else:
            print("Price is too high, waiting for it to go below the threshold.")

    def buy_stock(self):
        print("Buying stock...")

# Initialize the bot with a threshold of 100
ptm = TradingBot(100)

# Simulate current price of the stock
current_price = 95

# Use the bot to trade
ptm.trade(current_price)
```

In this code, we first define a `TradingBot` class with a `trade` method. This method checks if the current price of a stock is below a certain threshold. If it is, the bot initiates a trade by calling the `buy_stock` method. If the price is above the threshold, the bot does nothing and waits for the price to go down.

Please note that this is a very simplified version of a trading bot. In a real-world scenario, trading involves much more complex strategies and risk management.
