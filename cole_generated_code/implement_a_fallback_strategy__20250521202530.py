Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This function, `run_backtest`, simulates running a backtest and returns the results. If no results are found (simulated by a random chance in this case), it falls back to a default strategy.

```python
import random

def run_backtest():
    # Simulate running a backtest with a 10% chance of no results
    if random.random() < 0.1:
        print("No backtest results found.")
        return fallback_strategy()
    else:
        return "Backtest results"

def fallback_strategy():
    # Implement your fallback strategy here
    return "Fallback strategy results"

# Test the function
print(run_backtest())
```

In this code, `run_backtest` randomly fails to find backtest results 10% of the time. When this happens, it calls `fallback_strategy` and returns its results instead. You would replace the `fallback_strategy` function with whatever your fallback strategy is.

Please replace the `fallback_strategy` function and the probability in the `run_backtest` function according to your needs.
