Sure, here's a basic example of how you might create an EMA Crossover Analyzer in Python using the pandas library. This script will analyze the EMA crossover for a given stock using its closing prices.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as pdr
from datetime import datetime

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def ema_crossover_analyzer(stock, short_window, long_window):
    end = datetime.now()
    start = datetime(end.year - 1, end.month, end.day)
    data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(stock, start, end)

    short_ema = calculate_ema(data['Close'], short_window)
    long_ema = calculate_ema(data['Close'], long_window)

    data['Short EMA'] = short_ema
    data['Long EMA'] = long_ema

    # Create signals
    data['Buy_Signal'] = (short_ema > long_ema)
    data['Sell_Signal'] = (short_ema < long_ema)

    # Print data
    print(data)

# Test the function
ema_crossover_analyzer('AAPL', 12, 26)
```

This script will print a data frame with the closing prices, short EMA, long EMA, and the buy and sell signals for the stock. The buy signal is True when the short EMA is greater than the long EMA, and the sell signal is True when the short EMA is less than the long EMA.

Please note that you need to install pandas_datareader library if it's not installed yet. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install pandas-datareader
```

Also, this is a very basic EMA Crossover Analyzer. Depending on your needs, you might want to add more features or complexity to it.
