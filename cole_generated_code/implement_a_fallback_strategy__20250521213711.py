Sure, I can help with that. However, the implementation of the fallback strategy will depend on the context and what you want to do when no backtest results are found. Here is a simple example where we print a message and return an empty dictionary when no backtest results are found.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assuming backtest() is a function that returns backtest results
    results = backtest(strategy)
    
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy...")
        # Implement your fallback strategy here
        # For this example, we will just return an empty dictionary
        return {}
    
    return results
```

In this example, if the `backtest()` function returns an empty result (which could be an empty list, None, etc.), we print a message and return an empty dictionary. You can replace the print statement and the return statement with whatever fallback strategy you want to implement.
