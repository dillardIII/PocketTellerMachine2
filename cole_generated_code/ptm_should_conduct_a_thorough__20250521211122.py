As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I can provide you with a basic structure of Python code that could be used to analyze market data. However, please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading analysis would require more complex algorithms, data sources, and possibly machine learning models.

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as web
import datetime

# Define the instruments to download. We would like to see Apple, Microsoft and the S&P500 index.
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', '^GSPC']

# Define which online source to use
data_source = 'yahoo'

# Define the start and end dates
start_date = datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=365)
end_date = datetime.datetime.now()

# Use pandas_datareader.data.DataReader to load the desired data
panel_data = web.DataReader(tickers, data_source, start_date, end_date)

# Getting just the adjusted closing prices. This will return a Pandas DataFrame
# The index in this DataFrame is the major index of the panel_data.
close = panel_data['Adj Close']

# Getting all weekdays in the desired date range
all_weekdays = pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date, freq='B')

# Align the existing prices in adj_close with our new set of dates
close = close.reindex(all_weekdays)

# Reindexing will insert missing values (NaN) for the dates that were not present
# in the original set. We can fill the missing by replacing them with the latest available price for each instrument.
close = close.fillna(method='ffill')

print(close.describe())

# Here you can implement any trading strategy or machine learning model for prediction
# For example, you can calculate technical indicators like RSI, MACD, SMA etc.
# You can also use machine learning models to predict the future prices.
```

This code will download the historical market data for Apple, Microsoft, and the S&P500 index from Yahoo Finance, fill any missing values, and print the statistical summary of the data. 

Please note that you need to install pandas_datareader library to use this code. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install pandas_datareader
```

Also, this code doesn't implement any trading strategy or prediction model. You need to implement it based on your requirements.
