Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs the backtest and returns the results, and a function `fallback_strategy()` that implements your fallback strategy.

```python
def execute_strategy():
    backtest_results = run_backtest()

    if backtest_results is None or len(backtest_results) == 0:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy.")
        fallback_results = fallback_strategy()
        return fallback_results
    else:
        return backtest_results

def run_backtest():
    # Your code to run backtest goes here
    # This is a placeholder and will not return any results
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your code for the fallback strategy goes here
    # This is a placeholder and will not return any results
    return None

# Execute the strategy
results = execute_strategy()
```

In this code, `execute_strategy()` is the main function that runs the backtest and implements the fallback strategy if no backtest results are found. The `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` functions are placeholders and should be replaced with your actual backtest and fallback strategy code.
