Sure, here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, I'm assuming that the backtest function returns None when no results are found.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest function
    # It should return the results if successful, or None if no results are found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your fallback strategy
    # It should be implemented to handle the case when no backtest results are found
    pass

def run_backtest(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")
        results = fallback_strategy()
    return results
```

In this code, `run_backtest` is the main function you would call with your trading strategy. If the `backtest` function returns `None`, indicating that no results were found, it will automatically run the `fallback_strategy` function. 

Please replace the `pass` in `backtest(strategy)` and `fallback_strategy()` with your actual backtest and fallback strategy code.
