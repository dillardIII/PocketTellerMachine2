To conduct a market analysis, we'll need to use some financial data. We can use the `yfinance` library in Python to fetch this data. Here's a basic example of how you might set up a script to analyze the market.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Define the list of stocks we're interested in
stocks = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'FB']

# Define the period for which we want to get data
period = '1y'

# Create an empty DataFrame to store the data
data = pd.DataFrame()

# Fetch the data
for stock in stocks:
    ticker_data = yf.Ticker(stock)
    ticker_df = ticker_data.history(period=period)
    ticker_df['Symbol'] = stock  # Add a column to identify the stock
    data = data.append(ticker_df)

# Now, you can perform your analysis on the `data` DataFrame.
# For example, you might want to calculate the average closing price for each stock:
average_closing_prices = data.groupby('Symbol')['Close'].mean()

print(average_closing_prices)
```

This is a very basic example. A real market analysis might involve more complex calculations and could take into account other factors like news events or macroeconomic data. You might also want to use machine learning techniques to predict future price movements.

Please note that you need to install `yfinance` and `pandas` libraries. You can install them using pip:

```shell
pip install yfinance pandas
```

Also, please be aware that this script might not work as expected if the market is closed at the time you run it, because `yfinance` fetches live market data.
