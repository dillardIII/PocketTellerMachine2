Sure, here is a simple example of how you might use Python to analyze market trends. This code uses the pandas library to analyze historical stock data and calculate the moving average, which is a common indicator used in trend analysis.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take many more factors into account.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as web
import datetime as dt

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'  # Apple Inc.

# Get data for the specified period
start = dt.datetime(2020,1,1)
end = dt.datetime.now()
df = web.DataReader(tickerSymbol, 'yahoo', start, end)

# Calculate the moving average
df['MA10'] = df['Adj Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
df['MA50'] = df['Adj Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# A basic trading strategy could be to buy when the 10-day MA is above the 50-day MA
df['Buy_Signal'] = (df['MA10'] > df['MA50'])

print(df)
```

This script fetches historical stock data for Apple Inc. from Yahoo Finance, calculates the 10-day and 50-day moving averages, and generates a buy signal whenever the 10-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average. 

Please note that you need to install the `pandas_datareader` library to fetch the data from Yahoo Finance. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas_datareader
```

Also, this is a very simplistic trading strategy and not recommended for actual trading. For real trading, you should consider many other factors and possibly use machine learning algorithms to predict the stock price.
