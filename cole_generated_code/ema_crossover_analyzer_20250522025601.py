Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a simple implementation of an EMA Crossover Analyzer using Python and pandas library. This code assumes that you have a dataframe `df` with a 'Close' column for closing prices.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def ema_crossover_analyzer(df):
    # Define short and long windows
    short_window = 12
    long_window = 26

    # Initialize signals DataFrame with signal column
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Create short and long simple moving averages over the respective periods
    signals['short_ema'] = calculate_ema(df['Close'], short_window)
    signals['long_ema'] = calculate_ema(df['Close'], long_window)

    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_ema'][short_window:] 
                                                > signals['long_ema'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   

    # Generate trading orders
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals
```

This function will return a DataFrame with columns 'signal', 'short_ema', 'long_ema', and 'positions'. 'signal' column will tell you when the short EMA is above the long EMA (indicated by 1) and vice versa (indicated by 0). 'positions' column will tell you when to buy (indicated by 1) and when to sell (indicated by -1).

You can adjust the short and long window parameters as per your needs. The typical values used for short and long windows are 12 and 26 respectively. 

Please note that you need to have pandas and numpy installed in your Python environment to run this code. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```
