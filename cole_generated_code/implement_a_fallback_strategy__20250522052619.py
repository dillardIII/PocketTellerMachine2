Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this example, we will assume that the backtest results are stored in a list. If the list is empty, we will execute the fallback strategy.

```python
# List to store backtest results
backtest_results = []

# Fallback strategy
def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
    # Add your fallback strategy code here

# Check if backtest results exist
if len(backtest_results) == 0:
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    print("Backtest results found.")
```

In this code, the `fallback_strategy` function is called when there are no backtest results. You can replace the print statement inside the `fallback_strategy` function with your actual fallback strategy.

Please replace the `fallback_strategy` function with your actual fallback strategy. This is just a template and the actual implementation will depend on the specifics of your trading system.
