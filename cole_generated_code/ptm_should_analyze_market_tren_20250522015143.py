To complete this task, we will need to use Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation and analysis, yfinance to download historical market data from Yahoo finance, and sklearn for machine learning.

Here is a simple example of how you might use these libraries to analyze market trends and make trading decisions. In this example, we will use a simple moving average strategy.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = "AAPL"
data = yf.download(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2021-12-31")

# Calculate moving averages
data['SMA_20'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a 'Signal' column where if 20-day moving average is above 50-day moving average then set Signal as 1 else 0
data['Signal'] = 0.0  
data['Signal'][data['SMA_20'] > data['SMA_50']] = 1.0

# The trading decision is made: 'Buy' if the signal is 1, else 'Sell'
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Print data
print(data)

# Prepare data for machine learning model
X = data[['SMA_20', 'SMA_50']]
y = data['Signal']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the machine learning model
clf = svm.SVC()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the model to make predictions on the test data
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

# Print the predictions
print(predictions)
```

This is a very basic example and in a real-world scenario, you would need to consider many other factors and use more complex strategies and machine learning models.
