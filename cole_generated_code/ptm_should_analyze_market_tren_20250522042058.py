To analyze market trends and patterns, we need historical data of the market. We can use libraries like pandas to handle data, matplotlib to plot data, and sklearn to create prediction models. Here is a simple example of how you can do it:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# We will use 'Open' and 'Close' prices to find trends
X = data['Open'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = data['Close'].values.reshape(-1,1)

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()  
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions using the testing set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Compare actual output values with predicted values
df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test.flatten(), 'Predicted': y_pred.flatten()})

# Plotting actual vs predicted
df1 = df.head(25)
df1.plot(kind='bar',figsize=(16,10))
plt.grid(which='major', linestyle='-', linewidth='0.5', color='green')
plt.grid(which='minor', linestyle=':', linewidth='0.5', color='black')
plt.show()
```

This is a very basic example. In real-world scenarios, you would need to consider many other factors and use more complex models to get accurate predictions. Also, you would need to use APIs to get real-time data.

Please note that this code assumes that you have a CSV file named 'market_data.csv' which contains historical market data with 'Open' and 'Close' prices. You need to replace it with your actual data file.

Also, this code does not identify trading opportunities. It just shows the trend of 'Open' and 'Close' prices. Identifying trading opportunities from these trends is a complex task and requires deep understanding of both programming and trading.
