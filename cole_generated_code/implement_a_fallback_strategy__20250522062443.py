Here is a simple python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to simply print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def get_backtest_results(backtest_id):
    # Assume we have a function `fetch_backtest_results` that fetches backtest results
    results = fetch_backtest_results(backtest_id)
    
    # If no results found, implement fallback strategy
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Fallback strategy activated.")
        return {}
    
    return results
```

In this code, `fetch_backtest_results` is a hypothetical function that fetches backtest results. If it returns an empty result, we print a message and return an empty dictionary as a fallback.

Please note that the actual fallback strategy can be more complex depending on your specific requirements. For example, you might want to trigger a new backtest, send an alert, or take some other action.
