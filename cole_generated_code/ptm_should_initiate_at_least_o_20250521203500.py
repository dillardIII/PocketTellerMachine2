Sure, here's a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. Please note that this is just a simulation and doesn't involve real trading. For real trading, you would need to use a trading API like Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, etc.

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, symbol, quantity, strategy):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.strategy = strategy

    def execute_trade(self):
        print(f"Executing {self.strategy} strategy...")
        print(f"Trading {self.quantity} of {self.symbol}...")
        # Here you would typically call your trading API to execute the trade
        print("Trade executed successfully!")

# Initialize a trade
trade = Trade("AAPL", 100, "Strategy1")

# Execute the trade
trade.execute_trade()
```

This code defines a `Trade` class with `symbol`, `quantity`, and `strategy` as attributes. The `execute_trade` method simulates the execution of a trade. We then create an instance of the `Trade` class and call the `execute_trade` method to simulate a trade.

For real trading, the `execute_trade` method should be implemented to call the trading API to execute the trade. The implementation will depend on the specific API you are using.
