Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, I'm assuming you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs your backtest and returns results. If no results are returned, the fallback strategy is executed.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    # return results

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
    # Your fallback strategy code here

def main():
    results = run_backtest()
    if not results:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found. Proceeding with normal strategy...")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This is a very basic example. Depending on your actual use case, you might want to handle exceptions, log errors, or take other actions in your fallback strategy.
