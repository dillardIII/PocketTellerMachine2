Sure, I can provide you with a simple Python code that simulates a trading action. However, please note that in real trading scenarios, you would need to use APIs provided by your trading platform and also have a well-defined trading strategy.

Here's a simple Python code that simulates a trading action:

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, symbol, quantity):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.quantity = quantity

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []

    def initiate_trade(self, trade):
        self.trades.append(trade)
        print(f"Trade initiated: Bought {trade.quantity} of {trade.symbol}")

# Create PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Define a trade
trade = Trade("AAPL", 100)

# Initiate a trade
ptm.initiate_trade(trade)
```

This code first defines a `Trade` class, which represents a trade with a specific symbol and quantity. Then it defines a `PTM` class, which can initiate trades. The `initiate_trade` method of the `PTM` class adds a trade to its list of trades and prints a message.

In the last part of the code, we create an instance of `PTM`, define a trade (buying 100 shares of AAPL), and initiate this trade. 

Please replace "AAPL" and quantity 100 with your desired stock symbol and quantity.
