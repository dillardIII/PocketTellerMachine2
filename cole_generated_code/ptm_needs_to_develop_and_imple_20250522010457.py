As an AI, I can provide you with a simple example of a Python code that uses a basic trading strategy. However, please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world trading strategies are much more complex and involve many other factors.

Here is a simple Python code that uses the Moving Average Crossover strategy. This strategy is one of the most commonly used strategies in trading. It involves two moving averages, one short-term and one long-term. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it is a signal to buy. Conversely, when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, it is a signal to sell.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

# Define the stock to be analyzed
stock = 'AAPL'

# Load the data
df = web.DataReader(stock, data_source='yahoo', start='01-01-2010')

# Calculate the short-term and long-term moving averages
df['Short_MA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
df['Long_MA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create a column 'Signal' such that if the short-term moving average is greater than the long-term moving average, then set 'Signal' as 1 else 0
df['Signal'] = 0.0  
df['Signal'][df['Short_MA'] > df['Long_MA']] = 1.0

# Create a column 'Position' which is the difference of the 'Signal' column and its previous row
df['Position'] = df['Signal'].diff()

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```

In this code, we first import the necessary libraries and define the stock to be analyzed. We then load the data from Yahoo Finance and calculate the short-term and long-term moving averages. We create a 'Signal' column that is set to 1 if the short-term moving average is greater than the long-term moving average and 0 otherwise. We then create a 'Position' column which is the difference of the 'Signal' column and its previous row. This 'Position' column tells us whether we should buy (1), sell (-1), or hold (0) the stock.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and does not take into account many other factors that could influence the decision to buy or sell a stock. Always consult with a financial advisor or do your own research before making trading decisions.
