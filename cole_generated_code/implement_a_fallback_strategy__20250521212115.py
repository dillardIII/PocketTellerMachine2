Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found:

```python
def backtest_strategy(data):
    try:
        # Assume backtest() is a function that performs backtesting and returns results
        results = backtest(data)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Backtest failed with error: {e}")
        results = None

    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Implement your fallback strategy here
        # For example, you might want to use a default set of parameters or a different trading strategy
        fallback_results = fallback_strategy(data)
        return fallback_results

    return results

def backtest(data):
    # Implement your backtest logic here
    pass

def fallback_strategy(data):
    # Implement your fallback strategy here
    pass
```

This function first tries to perform a backtest on the given data. If the backtest fails for any reason (e.g., an exception is thrown), or if the backtest does not return any results, the function implements a fallback strategy. This fallback strategy can be anything you want, such as using a default set of parameters or a different trading strategy.
