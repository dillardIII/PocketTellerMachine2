Sure, I can provide a basic structure for a Python code that could be used to implement different trading strategies. However, please note that the actual trading strategies can be very complex and require deep understanding of financial markets.

```python
class TradingStrategy:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def apply_strategy(self, data):
        raise NotImplementedError

class MeanReversionStrategy(TradingStrategy):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("Mean Reversion")

    def apply_strategy(self, data):
        # Implement the logic of Mean Reversion strategy here
        pass

class MomentumStrategy(TradingStrategy):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("Momentum")

    def apply_strategy(self, data):
        # Implement the logic of Momentum strategy here
        pass

class PairTradingStrategy(TradingStrategy):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("Pair Trading")

    def apply_strategy(self, data):
        # Implement the logic of Pair Trading strategy here
        pass

# Example of how to use these classes
mean_reversion = MeanReversionStrategy()
momentum = MomentumStrategy()
pair_trading = PairTradingStrategy()

strategies = [mean_reversion, momentum, pair_trading]

for strategy in strategies:
    strategy.apply_strategy(data)
```

In this code, we have a base class `TradingStrategy` and three derived classes `MeanReversionStrategy`, `MomentumStrategy`, and `PairTradingStrategy` each representing a different trading strategy. The actual logic of these strategies needs to be implemented in the `apply_strategy` method of each class.

Please note that trading in financial markets involves significant risk, and this code is a very simplified representation of how trading strategies could be structured in Python. It doesn't include any risk management, portfolio optimization, or other important aspects of a real trading system.
