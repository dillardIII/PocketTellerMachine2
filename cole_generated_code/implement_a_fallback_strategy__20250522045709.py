Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This is a very basic example and the actual fallback strategy would depend on your specific requirements.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest logic
    # It should return the backtest results if they exist, otherwise None
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your fallback strategy
    # It should return the fallback results
    pass

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy.")
        results = fallback_strategy()
    return results

# Execute the strategy
strategy = "Your trading strategy here"
execute_strategy(strategy)
```

In this code, `backtest(strategy)` is a function that performs a backtest on a given trading strategy and returns the results. If no results are found (i.e., the function returns `None`), then the `fallback_strategy()` function is called to provide an alternative set of results. The `execute_strategy(strategy)` function orchestrates this process.
