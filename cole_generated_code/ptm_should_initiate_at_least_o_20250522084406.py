Here is a simple Python code that uses the yfinance library to download stock market data. This code doesn't actually initiate a trade but it can be used to analyze market trends which can then be used to decide whether to initiate a trade or not.

```python
import yfinance as yf

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-1-25')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)
```

This code will print the historical data for the Apple stock from January 1, 2010 to January 25, 2020. You can change the ticker symbol to get data for any other stock.

Please note that initiating a trade involves connecting to a brokerage, which would require authentication and is beyond the scope of this code. For that, you would need to use a library like Alpaca, Interactive Brokers etc. depending on your brokerage. Always remember to protect your credentials and never share them.
