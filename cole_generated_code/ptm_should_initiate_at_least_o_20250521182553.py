Sure, here's a simple example of how you might initiate a trade using Python. This code assumes you have a function called `evaluate_strategy()` that determines whether to buy or sell based on your current strategies.

```python
class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # initial balance
        self.stock_price = 100  # price of a stock
        self.stocks = 0  # number of stocks owned

    def buy(self, num_stocks):
        if self.balance >= num_stocks * self.stock_price:
            self.balance -= num_stocks * self.stock_price
            self.stocks += num_stocks
            print(f"Bought {num_stocks} stocks")

    def sell(self, num_stocks):
        if self.stocks >= num_stocks:
            self.balance += num_stocks * self.stock_price
            self.stocks -= num_stocks
            print(f"Sold {num_stocks} stocks")

    def evaluate_strategy(self):
        # This is a placeholder for your actual strategy.
        # It randomly decides to buy or sell.
        import random
        return random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])

    def initiate_trade(self):
        action = self.evaluate_strategy()
        if action == 'buy':
            self.buy(1)
        elif action == 'sell':
            self.sell(1)

# Create a PTM and initiate a trade
ptm = PTM()
ptm.initiate_trade()
```

This code creates a simple trading model (PTM) with methods to buy and sell stocks. The `initiate_trade()` method uses the `evaluate_strategy()` method to decide whether to buy or sell a stock, then carries out the trade. 

Please replace the `evaluate_strategy()` method with your actual trading strategy. This code is a very basic example and may not cover all the aspects of a real-world trading system, such as handling multiple types of stocks, dealing with transaction fees, etc.
