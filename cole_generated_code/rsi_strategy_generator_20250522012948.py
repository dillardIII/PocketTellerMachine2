The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. Here is a simple Python code that generates a trading strategy based on the RSI.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

# Download historical data for required stocks
ticker = "AAPL"
yf.pdr_override()
df = pdr.get_data_yahoo(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2021-12-31")

def calculate_RSI(df, period=14):
    delta = df['Adj Close'].diff()
    up, down = delta.copy(), delta.copy()
    up[up < 0] = 0
    down[down > 0] = 0
    average_gain = up.rolling(window=period).mean()
    average_loss = abs(down.rolling(window=period).mean())
    rs = average_gain / average_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi

df['RSI'] = calculate_RSI(df)

def implement_RSI_strategy(df, buy_level=30, sell_level=70):
    df['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(df['RSI'] < buy_level, 1, 0)
    df['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(df['RSI'] > sell_level, 1, 0)
    return df

df = implement_RSI_strategy(df)

print(df)
```

In this code, we first download the historical data for a specific stock using the `yfinance` library. Then, we calculate the RSI for the stock's adjusted close price. The RSI is calculated based on a specified period (default is 14 days). The `calculate_RSI` function calculates the RSI and adds it as a new column to the DataFrame.

Next, we implement the RSI strategy by creating buy and sell signals. If the RSI is below a certain level (default is 30), it indicates that the stock is oversold and a buy signal is generated. If the RSI is above a certain level (default is 70), it indicates that the stock is overbought and a sell signal is generated. The `implement_RSI_strategy` function adds these buy and sell signals as new columns to the DataFrame.

Finally, we print the DataFrame which now includes the RSI and the buy and sell signals.
