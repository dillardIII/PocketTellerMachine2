Here is a simple way to implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this example, I will use a try/except block to handle the situation when no backtest results are found. 

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    try:
        # Try to backtest the strategy
        results = strategy.backtest()
        
        if not results:
            raise ValueError("No backtest results found")
            
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
        # Fallback strategy
        print("Executing fallback strategy...")
        results = strategy.fallback()
        
    return results

# Assuming Strategy is a class with backtest and fallback methods
class Strategy:
    def backtest(self):
        # Implement backtest logic here
        pass

    def fallback(self):
        # Implement fallback logic here
        pass

# Instantiate a strategy
strategy = Strategy()

# Backtest the strategy
backtest_strategy(strategy)
```

In this code, the `backtest_strategy` function attempts to backtest a given strategy. If no results are found (i.e., the results are `None` or an empty list), it raises a `ValueError`. This error is caught in the `except` block, where the fallback strategy is then executed. 

Please replace the `pass` in `backtest` and `fallback` methods with your actual implementation.
