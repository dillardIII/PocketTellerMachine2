To identify why no trades were placed today, one could potentially check few things:

1. The live market data feed.
2. If there are open positions and they're affecting trade.
3. Historical data.
4. The conditions for the trading strategy weren't met.
5. Check for errors in the log files.

I can demonstrate a sample Python code for you. Here it is:

```python
import pandas as pd
import logging
from datetime import datetime

# Load the live data feed
try:
    live_data = pd.read_csv('live_data.csv')
except Exception as e:
    logging.error("Error in loading live data feed: " + str(e))

# Load the history data
try:
    history_data = pd.read_csv('history_data.csv')     
except Exception as e:
    logging.error("Error in loading history data: " + str(e))

# Load the open positions data
try:
    open_positions = pd.read_csv('open_positions.csv')
except Exception as e:
    logging.error("Error in loading open positions data: " + str(e))
    
# Define the trading strategy. 
# Note: This is a placeholder, the actual strategy can be more complicated
def trading_strategy(data):
    trade_condition = False
    if len(data) > 0:
        # for example, this strategy only places a trade if the latest close price is higher than 100
        trade_condition = data.iloc[-1]['Close'] > 100 
    return trade_condition

# Evaluate the trading strategy 
no_trades_today = not trading_strategy(live_data)

if no_trades_today:
    if len(live_data) == 0:
        print("The live data feed is empty at", datetime.now())

    elif len(open_positions) > 0 and sum(open_positions['Quantity']) < 0:
        print("There are open short positions, this might be affecting the trades.")
        
    elif not trading_strategy(history_data):
        print("The conditions for the trading strategy were not met based on historical data.")
        
    else:
        print("There is an unknown error. Please review the logs and trading strategy.")
else:
    print("Orders were placed today.")
```

There can be countless reasons why no trades were placed, such as network issues, missing or incomplete data, etc. Here we are considering few scenarios. Also, the implemented strategy is a simple one which can be replaced with the real strategy.
