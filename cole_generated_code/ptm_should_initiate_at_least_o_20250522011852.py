Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation using a hypothetical trading API:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import requests
import json

# Define the API endpoint
api_endpoint = "https://api.hypotheticaltrading.com/v1/trades"

# Define the trade details
trade_details = {
    "symbol": "PTM",
    "quantity": 100,
    "action": "BUY"
}

# Convert the trade details to JSON
trade_details_json = json.dumps(trade_details)

# Define the headers for the API request
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
}

# Initiate the trade
response = requests.post(api_endpoint, data=trade_details_json, headers=headers)

# Check if the trade was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Trade initiated successfully.")
else:
    print("Failed to initiate trade. Error:", response.text)
```

Please replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key. Also, this is a hypothetical example, the real implementation would depend on the actual trading API you are using.

This script sends a POST request to the trading API to initiate a trade. It buys 100 shares of PTM. If the request is successful, it prints "Trade initiated successfully." If not, it prints the error message.

Please note that this is a very basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle various other aspects such as error handling, logging, and more. Also, remember that trading involves financial risk, so always use caution and consult with a financial advisor if needed.
