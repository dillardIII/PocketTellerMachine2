Sure, here is a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, the fallback strategy is to simply print a message and return an empty dictionary. However, in a real-world scenario, you might want to implement a more sophisticated fallback strategy.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Simulate backtesting the strategy
    results = {}  # Assume we couldn't find any results

    if not results:
        return fallback_strategy()

    return results

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Falling back to default strategy.")
    # Implement your fallback strategy here
    # For now, just return an empty dictionary
    return {}

# Test the function
print(backtest_strategy("my_strategy"))
```

In this code, `backtest_strategy` is a function that simulates backtesting a trading strategy. If no results are found (i.e., `results` is an empty dictionary), it calls `fallback_strategy` to implement a fallback strategy. In this simple example, `fallback_strategy` just prints a message and returns an empty dictionary. In a real-world scenario, you might want `fallback_strategy` to implement a more sophisticated fallback strategy, such as using a default trading strategy.
