To actively engage in trading, we need to implement a trading strategy. Here is a simple Python code using a basic moving average crossover strategy. This strategy buys when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average and sells when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average. 

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and should not be used for actual trading without further improvements and risk management.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
def download_data(stock, start, end):
    data = {}
    ticker = yf.download(stock, start, end)
    data['Price'] = ticker['Adj Close']
    return pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate moving averages
def calculate_MA(data, short_window, long_window):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['Price'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['Price'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                                > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()
    return signals

# Execute the trading strategy
def execute_trading_strategy(stock, start_date, end_date, short_window, long_window):
    data = download_data(stock, start_date, end_date)
    signals = calculate_MA(data, short_window, long_window)

    # Print the buy/sell signals
    print('Buy signals:')
    print(signals[signals.positions == 1.0])
    print('Sell signals:')
    print(signals[signals.positions == -1.0])

# Define the stock, start and end date, and the short and long window for moving averages
stock = 'AAPL'
start_date = '2020-01-01'
end_date = '2021-12-31'
short_window = 40
long_window = 100

execute_trading_strategy(stock, start_date, end_date, short_window, long_window)
```

This code uses the `yfinance` library to download historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance, calculates the short and long-term moving averages, generates trading signals based on these moving averages, and prints the buy/sell signals.

Please note that this is a simulation and does not actually execute any trades. To execute trades, you would need to integrate this code with a trading platform's API, which is beyond the scope of this task.
