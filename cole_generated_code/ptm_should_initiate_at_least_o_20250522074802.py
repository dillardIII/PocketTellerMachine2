Sure, here is a simple Python code using `yfinance` library to initiate a trade. In this example, we will buy 1 share of Apple Inc. Please note that this is a simulated trade and won't actually execute because it requires a real trading API to connect with a brokerage.

```python
import yfinance as yf

def initiate_trade():
    # Define the stock to trade
    stock = yf.Ticker("AAPL")

    # Get the current market price
    current_price = stock.info['regularMarketPrice']

    # Define the number of shares to buy
    shares_to_buy = 1

    # Calculate the total cost
    total_cost = current_price * shares_to_buy

    print(f"Initiating a trade to buy {shares_to_buy} share(s) of {stock.info['shortName']} at ${current_price} per share.")
    print(f"The total cost of this trade would be ${total_cost}.")

    # Here you would typically use a trading API to execute the trade
    # e.g., trade_api.place_order(stock='AAPL', shares=shares_to_buy)

initiate_trade()
```

Please replace the `trade_api.place_order` with the actual API call to your brokerage. Also, make sure you have enough balance in your account to make this trade.
