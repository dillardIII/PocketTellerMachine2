The task involves implementing a fallback strategy when no backtest result is found in Python. In this example, I'll assume that we have a function called `get_backtest_results()`. Our fallback strategy will be to return a message indicating that no backtest results were found, and initiating a new backtest using a function called `new_backtest()`.

Here is how you might do this.

```Python
def fallback_strategy():
    results = get_backtest_results()
    
    if not results:  # if there are no backtest results
        print("No backtest results found. Initiating a new backtest...")
        new_results = new_backtest()  
        return new_results

    return results

def get_backtest_results():
    # Your code here to get backtest results.
    # Returning an empty result for simulation.
    return {}

def new_backtest():
    # Your code here to initiate a new backtest.
    # For this sample assume we are returning new backtest results.
    return {"result1": "data1", "result2": "data2"}

# Running the fallback strategy for simulation.  
result = fallback_strategy()
print(result)
```

In this code, when the function `fallback_strategy()` is called, it initially tries to get the backtest results using `get_backtest_results()`. If the result is empty, it initiates a new backtest using `new_backtest()`. If the result is not empty, then it simply returns the existing backtest results.

Please replace `get_backtest_results()` and `new_backtest()` functions with your actual functions to fetch backtest results and to start a new backtest.
