Here is a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic trading strategy using Moving Average Crossover. This strategy is not a recommendation but a demonstration of how one might structure a trading strategy in Python.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# Define the instruments to download. We would like to see Apple, Microsoft and the S&P500 index.
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'SPY']

# We would like all available data from 01/01/2000 until 12/31/2016.
start_date = '2000-01-01'
end_date = '2016-12-31'

# User pandas_reader.data.DataReader to load the desired data. As simple as that.
panel_data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickers, start_date, end_date)

# Getting just the adjusted closing prices. This will return a Pandas DataFrame
# The index in this DataFrame is the major index of the panel_data.
close = panel_data['Adj Close']

# Getting all weekdays between 01/01/2000 and 12/31/2016
all_weekdays = pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date, freq='B')

# How do we align the existing prices in adj_close with our new set of dates?
# All we need to do is reindex close using all_weekdays as the new index
close = close.reindex(all_weekdays)

# Reindexing will insert missing values (NaN) for the dates that were not present
# in the original set. To cope with this, we can fill the missing by replacing them
# with the latest available price for each instrument.
close = close.fillna(method='ffill')

# Calculate the short and long window simple moving averages
short_window = 40
long_window = 100

signals = pd.DataFrame(index=close.index)
signals['signal'] = 0.0

# Short moving average
signals['short_mavg'] = close.rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

# Long moving average
signals['long_mavg'] = close.rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

# Create signals
signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                            > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   

# Generate trading orders
signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

# Print `signals`
print(signals)
```

This code uses Yahoo Finance to download historical stock data. It calculates short and long moving averages, and generates trading signals based on these. When the short moving average is above the long moving average, it generates a buy signal, and when it's below, it generates a sell signal.

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and should not be used for real trading without further improvements. For example, it doesn't take into account transaction costs, market impact, or risk management.
