Here's a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic trading strategy. This strategy is called Moving Average Crossover, which is commonly used in stock trading. This strategy is not guaranteed to increase activity and potential wins, but it's a start for testing new strategies.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    sma = data.rolling(window=window).mean()
    return sma

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    ema = data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()
    return ema

def trading_strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Short and long moving averages
    signals['short_mavg'] = calculate_sma(data, short_window)
    signals['long_mavg'] = calculate_sma(data, long_window)

    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

    # Generate trading orders
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

def test_strategy(symbol, start_date, end_date, short_window=5, long_window=20):
    data = web.DataReader(symbol, 'yahoo', start_date, end_date)['Adj Close']
    signals = trading_strategy(data, short_window, long_window)

    print(signals)

test_strategy('AAPL', '01-01-2020', '12-31-2020')
```

This code calculates the short-term (5 days) and long-term (20 days) moving averages of the stock prices. When the short-term average is higher than the long-term average, it's a signal to buy, and when the short-term average is lower, it's a signal to sell.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and might not work well in real trading. It's important to backtest any strategy with historical data before using it in live trading. Also, trading involves risks and it's important to understand those risks before trading with real money.
