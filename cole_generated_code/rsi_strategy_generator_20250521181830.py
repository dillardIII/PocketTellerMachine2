RSI (Relative Strength Index) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is usually used as tool in technical analysis in stock trading.

A simple RSI Strategy might involve buying when the RSI is under some low threshold (implying the asset is oversold) and selling when the RSI is above some high threshold (implying the asset is overbought). Below is a sample Python code that implements a basic RSI strategy.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as pdr
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime

def calculate_RSI(data, window):
    delta = data.diff()
    up, down = delta.copy(), delta.copy()
    up[up < 0] = 0
    down[down > 0] = 0
    average_gain = up.rolling(window=window).mean()
    average_loss = abs(down.rolling(window=window).mean())
    rs = average_gain / average_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi

def RSI_Strategy(data, low_RSI, high_RSI):
    buy_signals, sell_signals = [], []
    in_position = False
    for i in range(len(data)):
        if data[i] < low_RSI:
            if in_position:
                continue
            else:
                buy_signals.append(data.index[i])
                in_position = True
        elif data[i] > high_RSI:
            if in_position:
                sell_signals.append(data.index[i])
                in_position = False
    return buy_signals, sell_signals

# Get stock data
start_date = datetime(2020, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime.now()
data = pdr.get_data_yahoo('AAPL', start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Calculate RSI
data['RSI'] = calculate_RSI(data['Close'], window=14)

# Generate trading signals
buy_signals, sell_signals = RSI_Strategy(data["RSI"], 30, 70)

print(f"Buy signals: {buy_signals}")
print(f"Sell signals: {sell_signals}")
```
This Python script uses pandas_datareader to fetch stock data for a specific symbol (in this case, AAPL). It then calculates the 14-day RSI and generates trading signals based on the RSI strategy of buying when RSI is below 30 (suggesting the stock is oversold) and selling when RSI is above 70 (suggesting the stock is overbought). The lists `buy_signals` and `sell_signals` contain the dates of these events. 

Please install the required modules (pandas, pandas_datareader) if they are not installed. You can use the following commands to install:
```python
pip install pandas pandas_datareader
```
