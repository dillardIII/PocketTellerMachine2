To complete this task, we would need access to a database or a file containing the past trades data. However, I can give you a simple example of how you could analyze a CSV file containing past trades data using Python and Pandas library.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the past trades data from a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('past_trades.csv')

# Let's assume the CSV file has the following columns: 'trade_date', 'buy_sell', 'quantity', 'price', 'ticker'

# Identify trades where the price was the lowest in the past 30 days - potential missed opportunities for buying
df['min_price_30d'] = df.groupby('ticker')['price'].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(30).min())
df['missed_opportunity_buy'] = (df['buy_sell'] == 'sell') & (df['price'] == df['min_price_30d'])

# Identify trades where the price was the highest in the past 30 days - potential missed opportunities for selling
df['max_price_30d'] = df.groupby('ticker')['price'].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(30).max())
df['missed_opportunity_sell'] = (df['buy_sell'] == 'buy') & (df['price'] == df['max_price_30d'])

# Print missed opportunities
print("Missed Opportunities for Buying:")
print(df[df['missed_opportunity_buy']])
print("\nMissed Opportunities for Selling:")
print(df[df['missed_opportunity_sell']])
```

This script identifies trades where the price was the lowest or highest in the past 30 days, which could be considered as potential missed opportunities for buying or selling, respectively.

Please note that this is a very simplistic approach and real-world trading analysis would involve much more complex strategies and factors.
