To analyze market trends and opportunities for potential trades, you might need to use some Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and yfinance. Here is a simple example of how you can do it:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import yfinance as yf

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-1-25')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Calculate moving average
tickerDf['MA_50'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(50).mean()
tickerDf['MA_200'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(200).mean()

# Plot the closing price and moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.grid(True)
plt.plot(tickerDf['Close'],label='Close Price')
plt.plot(tickerDf['MA_50'], label='MA 50 day')
plt.plot(tickerDf['MA_200'], label='MA 200 day')
plt.legend(loc=2)
plt.show()

# Check for potential trades
potential_trades = tickerDf[tickerDf['MA_50'] > tickerDf['MA_200']]
print("Potential Trades: ")
print(potential_trades)
```

This script will download the historical price data for the Apple stock (AAPL), calculate the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, plot them, and then print out all the days where the 50-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average, which is a common trading signal.

Please note that this is a very simplistic analysis and real trading algorithms would be much more complex and take many more factors into account. Also, this script assumes that you have the yfinance library installed. If you don't, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance
```

Please replace 'AAPL' with your desired stock symbol.
