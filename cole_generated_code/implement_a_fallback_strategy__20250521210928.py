Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that you have a function `get_backtest_results()` that returns backtest results or `None` if no results are found, and a function `fallback_strategy()` that implements your fallback strategy.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Get backtest results
    results = get_backtest_results()

    # Check if results are found
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")
        # Continue with your normal strategy here

def get_backtest_results():
    # This function should return your backtest results, or None if no results are found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement your fallback strategy
    pass
```

You would need to replace the `get_backtest_results()` and `fallback_strategy()` functions with your actual code. The `run_backtest()` function checks if any backtest results are found, and if not, it runs the fallback strategy.
