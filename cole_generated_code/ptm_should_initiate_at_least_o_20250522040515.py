Sure, I can provide a simple Python code to simulate a trading bot. However, please note that real trading involves complex strategies and risk management which can't be covered in this simple example.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance

    def trade(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient balance for trade")
            return
        self.balance -= amount
        # Simulate win/loss with a 50/50 chance
        if random.choice([True, False]):
            # Win, increase balance by 150% of trade amount
            self.balance += amount * 1.5
            print(f"Trade won! Current balance: {self.balance}")
        else:
            # Loss, balance already deducted
            print(f"Trade lost. Current balance: {self.balance}")

# Initialize PTM with a balance of 1000
ptm = PTM(1000)

# PTM initiates a trade of 100
ptm.trade(100)
```

This code creates a simple trading bot (PTM) that can initiate a trade. The trade can either win (in which case the balance increases by 150% of the trade amount) or lose (in which case the balance decreases by the trade amount). The outcome of the trade is determined randomly with a 50/50 chance.
