As an AI model, I can provide a basic structure for a Python code that simulates a simple trading strategy. However, it's important to note that developing a successful trading strategy involves complex algorithms, backtesting, and market knowledge that goes beyond this simple example.

Here's a simple example of a Python code using pandas library to implement a moving average crossover strategy. This strategy is one of the most common systematic trading strategies that uses two moving averages, one short and one long. The strategy goes long when the short moving average crosses above the long moving average, and goes short when the short moving average crosses below the long moving average.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for required stocks
ticker = "AAPL"
ticker_data = yf.download(ticker,'2020-01-01','2021-12-31')

# Calculate short-term and long-term moving averages
short_sma = ticker_data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
long_sma = ticker_data['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create signals based on crossover
ticker_data['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(short_sma > long_sma, 1, 0)
ticker_data['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(short_sma < long_sma, -1, 0)

# Carry out the trading strategy
ticker_data['Trade_Position'] = ticker_data['Buy_Signal'] + ticker_data['Sell_Signal']

print(ticker_data)
```

This code will print the historical data of the specified ticker along with the buy and sell signals based on the moving average crossover strategy. Please note that this is a very basic and rudimentary trading strategy and should not be used for actual trading without proper backtesting and risk management.
