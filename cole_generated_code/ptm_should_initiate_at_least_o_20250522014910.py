Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that simulates a trade. For this example, I'll use a fictional stock trading API.

```python
import random
import requests

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []
        self.api_url = "http://example.com/api/trade"  # replace with actual API

    def evaluate_strategy(self, strategy):
        # Simulate stock prices
        stock_price = random.uniform(10.0, 200.0)
        if strategy == "buy_low":
            if stock_price < 50.0:
                self.initiate_trade("buy", stock_price)
        elif strategy == "sell_high":
            if stock_price > 150.0:
                self.initiate_trade("sell", stock_price)

    def initiate_trade(self, action, price):
        trade = {
            "action": action,
            "price": price,
            "quantity": 1
        }
        response = requests.post(self.api_url, json=trade)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            self.trades.append(trade)
            print(f"Trade successful: {trade}")
        else:
            print(f"Trade failed: {response.content}")

# Initialize PTM
ptm = PTM()

# Evaluate strategies
ptm.evaluate_strategy("buy_low")
ptm.evaluate_strategy("sell_high")
```

This code will simulate a stock price between $10 and $200. If the price is below $50, it will initiate a "buy" trade. If the price is above $150, it will initiate a "sell" trade. The `initiate_trade` method will send a POST request to the trading API to initiate the trade. If the trade is successful, it will be added to the `trades` list.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and doesn't take into account many factors that would be important in a real trading system, such as transaction fees, market depth, and timing. Also, the trading API is fictional and needs to be replaced with a real one.
