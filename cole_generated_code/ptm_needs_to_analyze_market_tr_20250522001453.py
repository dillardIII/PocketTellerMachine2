Sure, I can provide a basic example of how you might use Python to analyze market trends. In this example, I'll use the pandas library to analyze historical stock price data and the yfinance library to download the data from Yahoo Finance.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(50).mean()
data['MA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(200).mean()

# Plot closing price and moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price', color='blue')
plt.plot(data['MA_50'], label='50-day MA', color='red')
plt.plot(data['MA_200'], label='200-day MA', color='green')
plt.title('Historical Stock Price - ' + ticker)
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Identify potential buy/sell signals
buy_signals = []
sell_signals = []
for i in range(1, len(data)):
    if data['MA_50'].iloc[i] > data['MA_200'].iloc[i] and data['MA_50'].iloc[i-1] < data['MA_200'].iloc[i-1]:
        buy_signals.append(data.iloc[i].name)
    elif data['MA_50'].iloc[i] < data['MA_200'].iloc[i] and data['MA_50'].iloc[i-1] > data['MA_200'].iloc[i-1]:
        sell_signals.append(data.iloc[i].name)

print('Buy Signals:')
for i in buy_signals:
    print(i)
print('\nSell Signals:')
for i in sell_signals:
    print(i)
```

This script will download historical data for the specified ticker symbol, calculate 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and plot the closing price and moving averages. It will then identify potential buy signals (when the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA) and sell signals (when the 50-day MA crosses below the 200-day MA).

Please note that this is a very basic example of trend analysis, and real trading strategies would likely involve more complex analysis and risk management.
