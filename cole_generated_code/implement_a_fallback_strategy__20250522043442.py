Sure, I'll provide a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the program will print a message and then proceed to execute the fallback strategy.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # This function is a placeholder and should be replaced with your actual backtest function
    # It should return a list of backtest results
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function is a placeholder and should be replaced with your actual fallback strategy function
    # It should also return a list of backtest results
    pass

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest_strategy(strategy)
    
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy.")
        results = fallback_strategy()
    
    return results

# Execute the strategy
strategy = "Your trading strategy here"
execute_strategy(strategy)
```

Please replace the `backtest_strategy` and `fallback_strategy` functions with your actual functions. The `backtest_strategy` function should return a list of backtest results, and the `fallback_strategy` function should also return a list of backtest results. If no backtest results are found, the program will print a message and then proceed to execute the fallback strategy.
