There are many different types of trading strategies and it would certainly not be practical, or even possible, to implement all of them in a single piece of code. However, I will provide a simple example of a common type of trading strategy: a moving average crossover strategy implemented with the use of the `pandas` library for time series analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data

# Load 1 year of prices for a specific stock
df = data.DataReader('AAPL', 'yahoo', start='1/1/2020', end='12/31/2020')

# Calculate the short-term simple moving average
df['Short_SMA'] = df.Close.rolling(window=50, min_periods=1).mean()

# Calculate the long-term simple moving average
df['Long_SMA'] = df.Close.rolling(window=200, min_periods=1).mean()

# Create a column 'Signal' such that if the short-term SMA is greater than the long-term SMA, we will buy, else sell
df['Signal'] = np.where(df['Short_SMA'] > df['Long_SMA'], 1, 0)

# Create a column 'Position' which indicates the daily change in 'Signal'
df['Position'] = df['Signal'].diff()

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```

The code calculates two simple moving averages (SMAs) over different time periods and without survivability bias. If the shorter-term SMA is above the longer-term SMA, this suggests a bullish market and hence a buy signal. If the shorter-term SMA is below the longer-term SMA, it suggests a bearish market and hence a sell signal. This strategy is admittedly simple and should only be used for illustrative purposes, rather than as a serious tool for investing.

Keep in mind that trading involves significant risks, including the potential loss of all invested capital. You should always do your own research and consider consulting a qualified professional before making any investment decisions. This script doesn't provide personal investment advice.

Also, this code needs a reliable data source which is couched using `pandas_datareader` here. However, in the real world, data can be inaccurate, low resolution, or simply not available, but these practical issues have been ignored here for the sake of simplicity.
