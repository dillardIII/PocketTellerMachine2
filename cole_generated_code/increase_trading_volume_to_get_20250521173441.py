Depending on the Trading API you are using the actual steps and functions could be different. However, provided that no specific trading platform or API is mentioned, this is a basic example that you could adapt to your specific needs:

```python
# Installing required libraries
!pip install yfinance
import yfinance as yf

# Assuming that Cole is trading a specific stock named 'AAPL'
stock = yf.Ticker("AAPL")

# Get stock info
stock_info = stock.info

# If the trading volume is less than a certain value then increase trading volume
if stock_info['volume'] < 1000000:
    # Create a function to increase the trading volume (you would need to replace this function with the actual trading API's function)
    def increase_trading_volume(ticker_symbol):
        # Insert the code for increase trading volume here (code will be different depending on the Trading API you're using)
        print(f"Increasing trading volume for {ticker_symbol}")

    # Increase the trading volume
    increase_trading_volume("AAPL")```

Please note:

1. More often than not, trading volume indicates the number of shares or contracts traded in a security or entire market during a given period and we, as traders or investors, don't have control over it. However, some platforms provide simulated trading where you could potentially control the volume of trading.

2. In case of algorithmic, high-frequency trading, one could control the frequency and volume of trades performed by the algorithm. But this requires a proper setup with a trading platform or exchange that supports algorithmic trading.
   
3. The above script is a dummy example and would not actually perform trades. Real trading would involve interfacing with a real trading API like ETrade, TD Ameritrade, Alpaca, etc., which are outside the scope of this example.
   
4. Please be aware, trading is risky and you should only implement such systems if you fully understand the implications.
