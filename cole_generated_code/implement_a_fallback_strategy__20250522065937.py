Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This example assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that returns backtest results, and a function `run_fallback()` that runs your fallback strategy.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    try:
        # Try to get backtest results
        results = run_backtest()
        if not results:
            raise ValueError("No backtest results found")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        print("Running fallback strategy...")
        # If there's an error or no results, run the fallback strategy
        results = run_fallback()
    finally:
        return results

# Replace with your actual backtest function
def run_backtest():
    # This is just a placeholder
    return None

# Replace with your actual fallback function
def run_fallback():
    # This is just a placeholder
    return "Fallback results"
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results()` first tries to run the backtest and get results. If it can't find any results (either because there's an error or because the results are empty), it runs the fallback strategy instead. The results of the fallback strategy are then returned.
