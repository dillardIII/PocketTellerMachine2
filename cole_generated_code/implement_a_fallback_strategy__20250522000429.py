Here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this example, we assume that the `backtest` function is supposed to return some results. If it doesn't, we fall back to a default strategy.

```python
def backtest():
    # This function is supposed to return backtest results
    # For the sake of this example, we will assume it returns None
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
    # Implement your fallback strategy here
    # For the sake of this example, we will just print a message
    print("Fallback strategy executed.")

def execute_strategy():
    results = backtest()
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found. Executing main strategy...")
        # Implement your main strategy here
        # For the sake of this example, we will just print a message
        print("Main strategy executed.")

# Execute the strategy
execute_strategy()
```

In this code, `execute_strategy` first tries to get the backtest results. If no results are found (i.e., `backtest` returns `None`), it executes the fallback strategy. Otherwise, it executes the main strategy. You can replace the print statements with actual strategy implementation code.
