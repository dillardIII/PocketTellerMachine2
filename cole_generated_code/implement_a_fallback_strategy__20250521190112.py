Sure, here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume backtest() is a function that returns backtest results
    results = backtest(strategy)

    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Fallback strategy can be anything. Here we just return an empty dictionary.
        return {}

    return results

# Call the function with a strategy
backtest_strategy("Strategy 1")
```

Please note that the actual implementation might be different based on the specifics of your project. The fallback strategy could be to use a default strategy, to retry the backtest, to wait and try again later, or anything else that makes sense in your specific context.
