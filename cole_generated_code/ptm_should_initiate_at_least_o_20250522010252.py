Sure, I can provide you with a simple example of how you might initiate a trade using an API like Alpaca (a stock brokerage service that provides an API for trading). 

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms require a lot more considerations such as risk management, portfolio optimization, etc.

First, you need to install the Alpaca API. You can do this with pip:

```python
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Here is a simple Python script that initiates a trade:

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Specify the stock we want to trade and the number of shares
symbol = 'AAPL'
qty = 1

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol=symbol,
    qty=qty,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)

# Get our new position
position = api.get_position(symbol)

# Print out some info about our position
print(f"We now own {position.qty} shares of {symbol}")
```

Please replace `<APCA-API-KEY-ID>` and `<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>` with your actual Alpaca API key and secret key.

This script will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock. After the trade is executed, it will print out the number of shares of Apple stock that we now own.

Please note that this script uses Alpaca's paper trading API, which allows you to simulate trades without risking real money. If you want to execute real trades, you would need to use Alpaca's live trading API and ensure you have sufficient funds in your account.
