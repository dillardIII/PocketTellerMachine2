Sure, I'll provide a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, I'll assume that you're running a function called `run_backtest()` to perform your backtest, and that this function returns `None` if no results are found.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    # If no results found, return None
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your fallback strategy here
    pass

# Run backtest
backtest_results = run_backtest()

# Check if backtest results were found
if backtest_results is None:
    print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    print("Backtest results found.")
    # Continue with your normal strategy
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` are placeholders for your actual backtest and fallback strategy implementations. If `run_backtest()` returns `None`, indicating that no backtest results were found, the `fallback_strategy()` function is called. Otherwise, the code continues with the normal strategy.
