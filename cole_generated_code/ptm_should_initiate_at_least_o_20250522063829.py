Sure, here is a simple example of a Python code that could be used to initiate a trade using a hypothetical trading API:

```python
import requests

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, base_url, api_key):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.api_key = api_key

    def initiate_trade(self, symbol, quantity, action):
        headers = {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': f'Bearer {self.api_key}'
        }

        data = {
            'symbol': symbol,
            'quantity': quantity,
            'action': action
        }

        response = requests.post(f'{self.base_url}/trades', headers=headers, json=data)

        if response.status_code == 200:
            print(f"Trade initiated successfully: {response.json()}")
        else:
            print(f"Failed to initiate trade: {response.json()}")

# Initialize PTM with base_url and api_key
ptm = PTM('https://api.trading.com', 'your_api_key')

# Initiate a trade
ptm.initiate_trade('AAPL', 10, 'buy')
```

Please note that this is a hypothetical example and won't work in real life. You would need to replace `'https://api.trading.com'` with the actual base URL of your trading platform's API and `'your_api_key'` with your actual API key. The `initiate_trade` method is used to send a POST request to the trading platform's API to initiate a trade. The `symbol` parameter represents the symbol of the stock to trade, `quantity` is the number of shares to buy or sell, and `action` should be either `'buy'` or `'sell'`.

Also, please remember that trading involves risk and you should only trade with what you can afford to lose.
