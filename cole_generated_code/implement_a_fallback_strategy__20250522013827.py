Here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found.

```python
def backtest_strategy(data):
    # Assuming backtest_strategy is a function that performs backtesting on given data
    # and returns the results. If no results are found, it returns None.
    results = None
    try:
        results = backtest_strategy(data)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred during backtesting: {str(e)}")

    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Implement your fallback strategy here
        fallback_strategy(data)
    else:
        return results

def fallback_strategy(data):
    # The fallback strategy can be anything. For this example, let's just print the data.
    print("Fallback strategy: printing the data.")
    print(data)
```
In this code, we first try to perform backtesting on the given data. If an error occurs or no results are found, we implement a fallback strategy. The fallback strategy can be anything - in this example, we just print the data.
