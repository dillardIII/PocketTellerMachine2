Your task does not seem to require Python coding as it's more related to a business decision. Python programming is used for data manipulation, analysis, automation and more. If you want to analyze past trading data to inform such a decision, then Python could be used. However, without specific details such as what data to analyze or what hypotheses to test, it's not possible for me to write specific Python code. Could you please provide more details?
