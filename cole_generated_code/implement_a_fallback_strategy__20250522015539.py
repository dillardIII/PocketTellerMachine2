Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This function will return a default value or perform a different action when no backtest results are available.

```python
def get_backtest_results(backtest_id):
    # Assume get_backtest is a function that retrieves backtest results
    # based on a backtest_id. It returns None if no results are found.
    results = get_backtest(backtest_id)

    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found for id: ", backtest_id)
        # Fallback strategy: return a default value or perform a different action
        return "Default Value"
    else:
        return results
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results` is a function that takes a `backtest_id` as input. It tries to get the backtest results by calling the `get_backtest` function. If `get_backtest` returns `None`, it means no backtest results were found. In this case, the function prints a message and returns a default value. If backtest results were found, it simply returns those results.

Please replace `"Default Value"` and `get_backtest` with appropriate values or actions based on your specific requirements.
