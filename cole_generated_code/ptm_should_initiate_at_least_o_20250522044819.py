Sure, here is a simple example of a Python code that simulates a trading bot. This bot will initiate at least one trade. The outcome of the trade (win or loss) is randomly determined.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance

    def trade(self):
        # Randomly decide the trade amount (cannot exceed current balance)
        trade_amount = random.uniform(0, self.balance)

        # Randomly decide the outcome of the trade (win or loss)
        trade_outcome = random.choice(['win', 'loss'])

        if trade_outcome == 'win':
            # If win, increase balance by trade amount
            self.balance += trade_amount
            print(f'Trade won! Balance is now {self.balance}')
        else:
            # If loss, decrease balance by trade amount
            self.balance -= trade_amount
            print(f'Trade lost! Balance is now {self.balance}')

# Initialize PTM with a balance of 1000
ptm = PTM(1000)

# PTM initiates a trade
ptm.trade()
```

Please note that this is a very simplified version of a trading bot. Real-world trading bots would take into account many factors such as market conditions, trading strategies, risk management, etc. before initiating a trade.
