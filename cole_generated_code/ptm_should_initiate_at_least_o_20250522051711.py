Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trading operation. It uses random numbers to represent the price of a stock. The decision to buy or sell is also random. The result of the trade (win or loss) is determined by comparing the buying and selling prices.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cash = 10000  # initial cash balance
        self.stock = 0  # initial stock balance

    def trade(self):
        price = random.uniform(50, 150)  # random stock price between 50 and 150

        # randomly decide to buy or sell
        if random.choice(['buy', 'sell']) == 'buy':
            # buy as much as possible
            quantity = self.cash // price
            self.cash -= quantity * price
            self.stock += quantity
            print(f'Bought {quantity} stocks at {price} each. Cash left: {self.cash}')
        else:
            # sell all stocks
            self.cash += self.stock * price
            print(f'Sold {self.stock} stocks at {price} each. Cash now: {self.cash}')
            self.stock = 0

        # calculate potential wins or losses
        if self.cash > 10000:
            print(f'Win of {self.cash - 10000}')
        elif self.cash < 10000:
            print(f'Loss of {10000 - self.cash}')
        else:
            print('No win or loss')

ptm = PTM()
ptm.trade()
```

This code is very simple and does not take into account many factors that are important in real trading. For example, it doesn't consider transaction fees, it doesn't have any strategy for buying or selling, and it doesn't use any information about the stock market to make decisions. It's just a basic example of how you might structure a trading program.
