To complete this task, we would need to use a Python library such as pandas for data analysis, and yfinance to download the historical market data from Yahoo Finance. We would also use matplotlib to visualize the data. Here's a simple example of how you might begin to analyze market trends:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters

register_matplotlib_converters()

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL','2020-01-01','2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA20'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['MA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Plot closing price, MA20 and MA50
plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
plt.grid(True)
plt.plot(data['Close'],label='AAPL')
plt.plot(data['MA20'], label='MA20')
plt.plot(data['MA50'], label='MA50')
plt.legend(loc=2)
plt.show()

# Identify potential buy/sell opportunities
buy_signals = (data['MA20'] > data['MA50']) & (data['MA20'].shift(1) < data['MA50'].shift(1))
sell_signals = (data['MA20'] < data['MA50']) & (data['MA20'].shift(1) > data['MA50'].shift(1))

# Print potential buy/sell dates
print("Potential Buy Dates:")
print(data.loc[buy_signals])

print("Potential Sell Dates:")
print(data.loc[sell_signals])
```

This script downloads the historical data for Apple's stock, calculates the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, and plots these along with the closing price. It then identifies potential buy signals (where the 20-day MA crosses above the 50-day MA) and sell signals (where the 20-day MA crosses below the 50-day MA), and prints the dates of these signals.

Please note that this is a very simple example of market trend analysis and should not be used for actual trading decisions without further refinement and testing.
