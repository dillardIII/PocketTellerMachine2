Sure, I can provide a simple Python code for a basic trading strategy. Here we will use a simple moving average crossover strategy. This strategy is a basic one where we buy when the short term moving average crosses above the long term moving average and sell when the short term moving average crosses below the long term moving average.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and real-world trading strategies can be much more complex and involve many other factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime

# Download historical data for required stocks
ticker = "AAPL"
tickerData = yf.Ticker(ticker)
data = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end=datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))

# Calculate short-term simple moving average
short_sma = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate long-term simple moving average
long_sma = data['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create signals based on crossover
data['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(short_sma > long_sma, 1, 0)
data['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(short_sma < long_sma, -1, 0)

# Carry out the trading strategy
data['Trade_Position'] = data['Buy_Signal'] + data['Sell_Signal']

print(data)
```

This code uses the yfinance library to download historical stock price data, pandas to manipulate the data, and numpy to carry out the calculations.

The code first calculates the short-term and long-term simple moving averages of the closing prices. It then generates trading signals based on the crossover of these moving averages. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it generates a buy signal, and when it crosses below, it generates a sell signal.

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and should not be used for actual trading without further enhancements and testing.
