Your request is quite broad and developing a trading strategy involves a lot of factors such as risk tolerance, investment goals, market conditions, etc. However, I can provide a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic moving average crossover strategy using pandas library. This strategy is quite popular in trading where you buy when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average and sell when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and in real trading scenarios, you would need to consider transaction costs, risk management, portfolio optimization, etc.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate short-term and long-term moving averages
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Create a column to hold the buy/sell signals
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['SMA_50'] > data['SMA_200']).astype(int)

# Shift the signal column down by one row to avoid forward-looking bias
data['Buy_Signal'] = data['Buy_Signal'].shift()

# Calculate daily returns of the strategy
data['Return'] = data['Buy_Signal'].shift() * data['Close'].pct_change()

# Calculate cumulative returns of the strategy
data['Cumulative Return'] = (1 + data['Return']).cumprod()

# Print the DataFrame
print(data)
```

This code downloads historical data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance, calculates 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA), generates buy/sell signals based on the crossover of these moving averages, and calculates the daily and cumulative returns of this strategy.

Please remember that this is a very basic strategy and may not be profitable in real trading. Always backtest your strategies on historical data and validate them on out-of-sample data before live trading.
