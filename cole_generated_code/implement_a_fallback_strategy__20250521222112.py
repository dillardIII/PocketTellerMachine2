Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, the fallback strategy is to simply print a message and return an empty dictionary. However, you could replace this with any fallback behavior you want.

```python
def get_backtest_results(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for the code that fetches backtest results.
    # In a real-world scenario, this would probably involve querying a database or an API.
    results = {}  # Assume no results found

    if not results:
        return handle_no_results(strategy)
    else:
        return results

def handle_no_results(strategy):
    print(f"No backtest results found for strategy: {strategy}")
    # Fallback strategy: return an empty dict
    return {}

# Test the function
strategy = "My Trading Strategy"
print(get_backtest_results(strategy))
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results()` is a function that is supposed to fetch backtest results for a given trading strategy. If no results are found, it calls `handle_no_results()`, which implements the fallback strategy.

Please replace the placeholder code with your actual code to fetch backtest results.
