Here's a simple Python code that simulates a trade using a hypothetical trading API. Please note that this is a mockup and won't work with real trading systems.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.experience = 0
        self.profit = 0

    def trade(self):
        # Simulate the process of trading
        # The profit and loss is randomly determined
        profit_or_loss = random.uniform(-1, 1)
        self.profit += profit_or_loss
        self.experience += 1
        return profit_or_loss

# Create a PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
profit_or_loss = ptm.trade()

if profit_or_loss > 0:
    print(f"Trade successful. Profit: {profit_or_loss}")
else:
    print(f"Trade resulted in a loss. Loss: {abs(profit_or_loss)}")

print(f"PTM's experience level is now: {ptm.experience}")
print(f"PTM's total profit is now: {ptm.profit}")
```

This code creates a `PTM` class that has methods for trading. The `trade` method simulates the process of trading and randomly determines whether the trade results in a profit or loss. The `PTM` class also keeps track of the total profit and the experience level (number of trades made). The code then creates an instance of `PTM`, initiates a trade, and prints the result of the trade and the updated experience level and total profit.
