To analyze market trends and opportunities, we would need historical data of the market. This data can be obtained from various sources like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, etc. Here is a simple Python code using pandas, yfinance (to download stock price data from Yahoo Finance), and matplotlib (for visualization). 

This code calculates the moving averages for a particular stock, which is a common indicator used in trend analysis. Please note that this is a very basic form of analysis and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take many more factors into account.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
def download_data(stock, start, end):
    data = yf.download(stock, start, end)
    return data

# Calculate moving averages
def calculate_moving_averages(data, short_window, long_window):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Short moving average
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Long moving average
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                                > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Plotting
def plot_data(data, signals):
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111, ylabel='Price in $')

    data['Close'].plot(ax=ax1, color='r', lw=2.)
    signals[['short_mavg', 'long_mavg']].plot(ax=ax1, lw=2.)

    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == 1.0].index, 
             signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == 1.0],
             '^', markersize=10, color='m')
             
    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == -1.0].index, 
             signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == -1.0],
             'v', markersize=10, color='k')

    plt.show()

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data for the specified period
start_date = '2010-01-01'
end_date = '2020-12-31'
data = download_data(tickerSymbol, start_date, end_date)

# Calculate moving averages
short_window = 40
long_window = 100
signals = calculate_moving_averages(data, short_window, long_window)

# Plot data
plot_data(data, signals)
```

In this code, we first download the historical data for a particular stock. Then, we calculate the short-term and long-term moving averages. When the short-term average is above the long-term average, it is a signal to buy (indicated by a '^' on the plot), and when it is below, it is a signal to sell (indicated by a 'v' on the plot).
