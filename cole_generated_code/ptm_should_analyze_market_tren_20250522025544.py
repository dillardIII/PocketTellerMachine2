To analyze market trends and adjust trading strategies, we can use machine learning models. Below is a simple Python code using the pandas library for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computations, and sklearn's RandomForestRegressor for predicting future trends.

Please note that this is a simplified version and real-world trading models can be much more complex. Also, this code assumes that you have a dataset (CSV file) with historical market data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Preprocess the data
data = data.dropna()

# Define the features and the target
features = data.drop('Target', axis=1)
target = data['Target']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
features_train, features_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(features_train, target_train)

# Use the model to predict future trends
predictions = model.predict(features_test)

# Define a simple trading strategy
def trading_strategy(predictions):
    if predictions[-1] > predictions[-2]:
        return 'Buy'
    else:
        return 'Sell'

# Adjust the trading strategy based on the predicted market trend
strategy = trading_strategy(predictions)
print('The adjusted trading strategy is:', strategy)
```

This code will output either 'Buy' or 'Sell' based on the predicted market trend. If the predicted trend is upwards, the strategy is to buy. If the predicted trend is downwards, the strategy is to sell.
