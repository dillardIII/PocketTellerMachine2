Sure, I can provide you with some simple Python code that implements two basic trading strategies: a momentum strategy and a mean reversion strategy. 

Please note that this is a very simplified version of what you might actually use in a real trading system. Also, you would need to have access to historical price data and a trading platform API to execute trades.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assuming we have a DataFrame 'df' with historical price data
df = pd.read_csv('historical_data.csv')

# Momentum Strategy: Buy when the price is going up, sell when it's going down
def momentum_strategy(df):
    # Calculate the difference in price from the previous day
    df['price_diff'] = df['Close'].diff()
    
    # Generate trading signals based on the price difference
    df['signal'] = np.where(df['price_diff'] > 0, 1, -1)
    
    return df

# Mean Reversion Strategy: Buy when the price is below the mean, sell when it's above
def mean_reversion_strategy(df):
    # Calculate the mean price over the past 10 days
    df['mean_price'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
    
    # Generate trading signals based on the mean price
    df['signal'] = np.where(df['Close'] < df['mean_price'], 1, -1)
    
    return df

# Test the strategies
momentum_df = momentum_strategy(df.copy())
mean_reversion_df = mean_reversion_strategy(df.copy())

print(momentum_df.head())
print(mean_reversion_df.head())
```

In the above code, the 'signal' column represents the trading signal generated by the strategy. A value of 1 means to buy, and a value of -1 means to sell. 

Remember, this is a very basic implementation and does not take into account transaction costs, slippage, risk management, or other important factors in a real trading system.
