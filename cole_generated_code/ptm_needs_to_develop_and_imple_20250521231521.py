To develop and implement a variety of trading strategies, we need to use a backtesting framework. Backtesting is the process of testing a trading strategy on relevant historical data to ensure its viability before the trader risks any actual capital. A good backtesting framework provides the trader with confidence that the strategy will work in the future.

In Python, there are several libraries available for backtesting such as PyAlgoTrade, bt, Backtrader, Zipline etc. Here, I'll provide a simple example using Backtrader library.

First, you need to install the library using pip:

```python
pip install backtrader
```

Here is a simple example of a moving average crossover strategy:

```python
import backtrader as bt

# Create a subclass of Strategy to define the indicators and logic

class SmaCross(bt.Strategy):
    # list of parameters which are configurable for the strategy
    params = dict(
        pfast=10,  # period for the fast moving average
        pslow=30   # period for the slow moving average
    )

    def __init__(self):
        sma1 = bt.ind.SMA(period=self.p.pfast)  # fast moving average
        sma2 = bt.ind.SMA(period=self.p.pslow)  # slow moving average
        self.crossover = bt.ind.CrossOver(sma1, sma2)  # crossover signal

    def next(self):
        if not self.position:  # not in the market
            if self.crossover > 0:  # if fast crosses slow to the upside
                self.buy()  # enter long

        elif self.crossover < 0:  # in the market & cross to the downside
            self.close()  # close long position


cerebro = bt.Cerebro()  # create a "Cerebro" engine instance

# Create a data feed
data = bt.feeds.YahooFinanceData(dataname='AAPL', fromdate=datetime(2011, 1, 1),
                                 todate=datetime(2012, 12, 31))
cerebro.adddata(data)  # Add the data feed

cerebro.addstrategy(SmaCross)  # Add the trading strategy
cerebro.run()  # run it all
cerebro.plot()  # and plot it with a single command
```

This is a simple moving average crossover strategy where we buy when the fast moving average crosses the slow moving average from below and sell when it crosses from above.

Please note that trading involves risk and this is just a simple example. You should develop more complex strategies and thoroughly backtest them before live trading.
