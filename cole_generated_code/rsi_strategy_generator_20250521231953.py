The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. Here is a simple Python code using the `pandas` and `yfinance` libraries to generate a basic RSI trading strategy.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_rsi(data, window):
    delta = data.diff()
    up, down = delta.copy(), delta.copy()
    up[up < 0] = 0
    down[down > 0] = 0

    average_gain = up.rolling(window=window).mean()
    average_loss = abs(down.rolling(window=window).mean())

    rs = average_gain / average_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi

def rsi_strategy(data, window=14):
    rsi = calculate_rsi(data['Close'], window)
    data['RSI'] = rsi

    buy_signals = (rsi < 30)
    sell_signals = (rsi > 70)

    data['Buy_Signal'] = buy_signals
    data['Sell_Signal'] = sell_signals

    return data

# Download historical data
ticker = "AAPL"
data = yf.download(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

# Generate RSI strategy
rsi_strategy(data)
```

This code calculates the RSI for a given window (default is 14 days as it is commonly used) and generates buy signals when the RSI is below 30 (oversold condition) and sell signals when the RSI is above 70 (overbought condition). Please note that this is a very basic strategy and should not be used for real trading without further improvements and risk management.
