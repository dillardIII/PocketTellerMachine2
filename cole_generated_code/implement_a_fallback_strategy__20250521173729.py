To implement a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found, you can use a try-except catch block or if-else conditions in Python. Here, I'll provide an example using a try-except block:

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    try:
        results = strategy.backtest()
        
        # No results found, throwing ValueError
        if not results:
            raise ValueError("No backtest results found.")

        return results

    # Implement the fallback strategy here
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
        print("Implementing Fallback Strategy...")
        
        # Assume fallback_strategy is another strategy we can backtest
        fallback_results = fallback_strategy.backtest()
        
        return fallback_results

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None
```

In this code, when the `strategy` doesn't produce any backtest results (`results` is `None` or empty), it raises a `ValueError`. This error is caught in the `except ValueError` block, and the fallback strategy is applied.

Please replace `fallback_strategy` with the actual fallback strategy you want to apply. If there's an error other than `ValueError`, it will be caught in the `except Exception` block. Additional error handling or notifications can be incorporated here.
