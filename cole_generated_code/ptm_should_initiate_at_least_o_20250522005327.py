Sure, here is a simple Python code to initiate a trade using a hypothetical trading API. Please note that this is a mock-up code and won't work in a real trading environment. You need to replace it with the actual API provided by your broker.

```python
import requests

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, api_key, api_url="https://api.broker.com"):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.api_url = api_url
        self.session = requests.Session()
        self.session.headers.update({'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'})

    def initiate_trade(self, symbol, qty, side, type, time_in_force):
        url = f"{self.api_url}/v2/orders"
        data = {
            "symbol": symbol,
            "qty": qty,
            "side": side,
            "type": type,
            "time_in_force": time_in_force
        }
        response = self.session.post(url, json=data)
        return response.json()

# Replace 'your_api_key' with your actual API key
ptm = PTM('your_api_key')

# Initiate a trade
# This will buy 1 share of AAPL with a market order which is good for the day
trade = ptm.initiate_trade('AAPL', 1, 'buy', 'market', 'gtc')

print(trade)
```

This code creates a PTM class that can initiate a trade. The `initiate_trade` method sends a POST request to the broker's API to place an order. The parameters of the method are the symbol of the stock, the quantity of shares to buy or sell, the side (buy or sell), the type of order (market, limit, etc.), and the time in force (gtc for good till cancelled, day for good for the day, etc.).
