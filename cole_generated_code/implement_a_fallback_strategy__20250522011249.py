Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the function will return a message indicating that no results were found and the fallback strategy has been activated.

```python
def backtest_strategy(data):
    # Assume `run_backtest` is a function that runs a backtest on the data
    # and returns a dictionary with results if successful, or None if no results are found
    results = run_backtest(data)
    
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Activating fallback strategy.")
        # Implement your fallback strategy here
        # For example, you might want to use a default set of results
        fallback_results = {
            "total_returns": 0,
            "annual_returns": 0,
            "annual_volatility": 0,
        }
        return fallback_results
    
    return results
```

This is a simple example and your actual implementation might be more complex. For instance, your fallback strategy might involve running a different type of backtest, using different parameters, or loading results from a previous successful backtest. The specifics would depend on the needs of your trading strategy and the nature of your data.
