To diversify a portfolio, we can invest in different types of assets such as stocks, bonds, and commodities from various sectors. Here is a simple Python code that simulates diversification using random weights for each asset in the portfolio.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as web
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# List of assets in portfolio
assets = ['AAPL', 'GOOG', 'IBM', 'MSFT', 'AMZN']

# Get the stock data
stock_data = pd.DataFrame()

for asset in assets:
    stock_data[asset] = web.DataReader(asset, data_source='yahoo', start='01-01-2010')['Adj Close']

# Calculate the logarithmic returns
log_returns = np.log(stock_data / stock_data.shift(1))

# Number of assets in portfolio
num_assets = len(assets)

# Set seed (optional)
np.random.seed(101)

# Create random weights for the assets and normalize to 1
weights = np.random.random(num_assets)
weights /= np.sum(weights)

# Calculate the expected portfolio return
exp_return = np.sum(weights * log_returns.mean()) * 250

# Calculate the expected portfolio variance
exp_variance = np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(log_returns.cov() * 250, weights))

# Calculate the expected portfolio volatility
exp_volatility = np.sqrt(exp_variance)

print("Expected Portfolio Return: ", exp_return)
print("Expected Portfolio Variance: ", exp_variance)
print("Expected Portfolio Volatility: ", exp_volatility)
```

This code calculates the expected return, variance, and volatility of a portfolio with randomly assigned weights to each asset. It uses historical data from Yahoo Finance for the calculations. 

Please note that this is a very basic example of portfolio diversification. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider other factors such as the correlation between assets, the risk tolerance of the investor, etc. Also, you would typically use optimization algorithms to find the optimal weights for each asset in the portfolio.
