Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return None. 

```python
def get_backtest_results(backtest_id):
    # Assume get_results is a function that retrieves backtest results based on a backtest_id
    # It returns None if no results are found
    results = get_results(backtest_id)

    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found for id: ", backtest_id)
        print("Falling back to default strategy...")
        # Implement your fallback strategy here
        # For this example, we'll just return None
        return None

    return results
```

Please replace the `get_results` function and the fallback strategy with your actual implementation. The `get_results` function is assumed to return None if no results are found. If your actual function throws an exception, you should catch it and handle it appropriately.
