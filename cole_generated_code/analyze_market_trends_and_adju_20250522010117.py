Analyzing market trends and adjusting trading parameters is a complex task that involves machine learning and data analysis. Here's a simplified example of how you might approach this using Python. This example uses a simple moving average strategy and adjusts the lookback period based on market volatility. 

Please note that this is a simplified example and real trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

# Define the stock to be analyzed
stock = 'AAPL'

# Download historical data as dataframe
df = web.DataReader(stock, data_source='yahoo')

# Calculate the standard deviation of daily returns as a proxy for volatility
df['Return'] = df['Adj Close'].pct_change()
df['Volatility'] = df['Return'].rolling(window=252).std() * np.sqrt(252)

# Define a function to calculate the moving average
def calculate_moving_average(df, lookback):
    return df['Adj.Close'].rolling(window=lookback).mean()

# Adjust the lookback period based on volatility
df['Lookback'] = np.where(df['Volatility'] > df['Volatility'].median(), 50, 200)

# Calculate the moving average
df['Moving Average'] = df.apply(lambda x: calculate_moving_average(df, int(x['Lookback'])), axis=1)

# Define a simple trading strategy: buy when the price is above the moving average, sell when it's below
df['Buy Signal'] = np.where(df['Adj Close'] > df['Moving Average'], 1, 0)
df['Sell Signal'] = np.where(df['Adj Close'] < df['Moving Average'], -1, 0)

# Calculate the strategy return
df['Strategy Return'] = df['Buy Signal'] * df['Return']

# Print the total return of the strategy
print('Total return:', df['Strategy Return'].sum())
```

This code calculates the volatility of a stock, adjusts the lookback period for the moving average based on this volatility, and then implements a simple trading strategy based on this moving average. The total return of the strategy is then printed.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors. Also, past performance is not indicative of future results.
