Sure, here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this example, we'll assume that the backtest function returns None when no results are found. The fallback strategy will simply print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This function is a placeholder and should be replaced with your actual backtest function
    # It should return None if no backtest results are found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Falling back to default strategy.")
    return {}

def run_backtest(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        results = fallback_strategy()
    return results

# Example usage:
strategy = "My Trading Strategy"
results = run_backtest(strategy)
```

In this code, `run_backtest` is the main function that you would call to run a backtest. If the `backtest` function returns `None`, it will call the `fallback_strategy` function. The `fallback_strategy` function can be modified to implement any fallback behavior you want. In this example, it simply prints a message and returns an empty dictionary.
