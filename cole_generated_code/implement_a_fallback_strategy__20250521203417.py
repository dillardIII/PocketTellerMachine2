Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assuming backtest() returns None when no results are found
    results = strategy.backtest()
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        fallback_strategy = FallbackStrategy()
        results = fallback_strategy.backtest()
        if results is None:
            print("Fallback strategy also failed. Please check your strategies.")
        else:
            print("Fallback strategy succeeded.")
            return results
    else:
        print("Backtest successful.")
        return results

class Strategy:
    def backtest(self):
        # Implement your backtest logic here
        pass

class FallbackStrategy(Strategy):
    def backtest(self):
        # Implement your fallback backtest logic here
        pass
```

This code assumes that you have a `Strategy` class with a `backtest` method that returns `None` when no results are found. When the `backtest_strategy` function is called with a strategy, it tries to backtest it. If no results are found, it falls back to a `FallbackStrategy`. If the fallback strategy also fails, it prints a message to check your strategies.
