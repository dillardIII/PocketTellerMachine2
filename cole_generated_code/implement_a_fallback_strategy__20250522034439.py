Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, when no backtest results are found, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume we have a function get_backtest_results that returns the backtest results
    # for a given strategy, or None if no results are found.
    backtest_results = get_backtest_results(strategy)
    
    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found for this strategy. Falling back to default strategy.")
        # Here, the fallback strategy is to return an empty dictionary.
        # You can replace this with whatever fallback behavior is appropriate for your application.
        return {}
    
    return backtest_results
```

This is a very basic example. Depending on your application, you might want to implement more complex fallback behavior. For example, you might want to try a different strategy, or perform some sort of error recovery.
