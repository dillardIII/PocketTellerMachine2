Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` which runs the backtest and returns the results, and a function `fallback_strategy()` which is your fallback strategy when no backtest results are found.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    # Run the backtest
    results = run_backtest()

    # Check if the results are empty or None
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")
        # Run the fallback strategy
        results = fallback_strategy()

    return results

def run_backtest():
    # This function should contain the logic to run the backtest
    # For now it just returns None
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should contain the fallback strategy
    # For now it just returns an empty dictionary
    return {}

# Get the backtest results
results = get_backtest_results()
print(results)
```

In this code, if `run_backtest()` returns `None` or an empty value, the `fallback_strategy()` function is called and its results are returned instead. You would need to replace `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` with your actual backtest and fallback strategy logic.
