Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet to implement a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that returns backtest results, and a function called `fallback_strategy()` that is executed when no backtest results are found.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    # Run the backtest
    results = run_backtest()

    # Check if the results are empty
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
        results = fallback_strategy()

    return results

def run_backtest():
    # This function should contain the code to run the backtest and return the results
    # For now, it just returns an empty list
    return []

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should contain the fallback strategy
    # For now, it just returns a string saying that the fallback strategy was executed
    return "Fallback strategy executed"

# Test the function
print(get_backtest_results())
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results()` is the main function. It first tries to get the backtest results by calling `run_backtest()`. If the results are empty (which is the case in this example because `run_backtest()` just returns an empty list), it executes the fallback strategy by calling `fallback_strategy()`. The results of the fallback strategy are then returned.
