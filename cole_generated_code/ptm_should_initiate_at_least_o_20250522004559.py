Sure, here's a simple Python code using the `alpaca_trade_api` library to initiate a trade. 

This code will buy 1 share of Apple (AAPL). Please note that you need to replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your actual Alpaca API key and secret.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Setup
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code will initiate a trade on the paper trading platform, which is a simulated trading environment where you can practice trading without risking real money. If you want to trade with real money, you need to use the live trading platform and be aware of the risks involved in trading.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading involves a lot more considerations, such as analyzing market data, managing risk, etc. You should only trade with real money if you have a good understanding of the market and trading strategies.
