Sure, I can help you write a simple Python code for a basic trading algorithm. Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and involve advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 1000  # initial balance
        self.history = []  # history of trades

    def trade(self):
        # Randomly decide to buy or sell
        action = random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])

        # Randomly decide on a price (between 10 and 50)
        price = random.randint(10, 50)

        if action == 'buy':
            # Can't buy if not enough balance
            if price > self.balance:
                return

            self.balance -= price
            self.history.append(('buy', price))
        else:  # sell
            self.balance += price
            self.history.append(('sell', price))

    def learn(self):
        # For now, just print the history
        for action, price in self.history:
            print(f"PTM decided to {action} at price {price}. Current balance: {self.balance}")

# Initialize PTM
ptm = PTM()

# PTM makes 100 trades
for _ in range(100):
    ptm.trade()

# PTM learns from its trading history
ptm.learn()
```

In this code, PTM (Python Trading Machine) starts with a balance of 1000. It makes 100 trades, each time randomly deciding whether to buy or sell, and at what price. After making all trades, it "learns" from its trading history by printing it out.

Please note that this is a very simple and unrealistic model of trading. In real-world trading, the decision to buy or sell would be based on a complex analysis of market trends and other factors, not on a random choice. Also, the price would not be randomly chosen but would be the current market price. The "learning" process would involve sophisticated machine learning algorithms, not just printing out the history.
