Sure, what I can provide is a basic Python script to simulate trading for PTM online. Though bear in mind that actual trading requires access to a trading API as well as sophisticated and safe algorithms, which cannot be handled in such a short piece of script.

Here's a simple simulation in Python:

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, name, balance=1000, num_trades_per_day=100):
        self.name = name
        self.balance = balance
        self.num_trades_per_day = num_trades_per_day

    def attempt_trade(self):
        result = random.choice(["win", "loss"])
        if result == "win":
            # The amount won is between 1% to 5% of current balance
            self.balance += self.balance * random.uniform(0.01, 0.05)
        elif result == "loss":
            # The amount lost is between 1% to 5% of current balance
            self.balance -= self.balance * random.uniform(0.01, 0.05)

    def trade_for_a_day(self):
        for _ in range(self.num_trades_per_day):
            self.attempt_trade()
        return self.balance

    def simulate_trading(self, num_days=1):
        for _ in range(num_days):
            self.trade_for_a_day()
        return self.balance

# Initialize PTM's trading profile:
ptm = Trade(name="PTM", balance=1000, num_trades_per_day=200)  # Increased num_trades_per_day to 200

# Simulate trading for one day:
new_balance = ptm.simulate_trading(num_days=1)

print(f"After one day of trading, PTM's balance is: {new_balance}")
```

In this simulation, we attempt to trade 200 times a day instead of the usual 100, which represents PTM's attempt to win more by trading more.

Please note that this code is a simple simulation and should not be used for actual trading. Real-world trading involves a lot more considerations such as transaction fees, time of execution, and more importantly, risk management. You should seek advice from professionals or use reputable third-party solutions to conduct any trading activities.
