Sure, here's a simple Python code using the Alpaca API to initiate a trade. Please replace 'APCA-API-KEY-ID' and 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY' with your actual Alpaca API keys.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up Alpaca API
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Define a function to initiate a trade
def initiate_trade(symbol, qty, side, type, time_in_force):
    api.submit_order(
        symbol=symbol,
        qty=qty,
        side=side,
        type=type,
        time_in_force=time_in_force
    )

# Call the function to initiate a trade
initiate_trade('AAPL', 1, 'buy', 'market', 'gtc')
```

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple Inc. ('AAPL') at the current market price. The order is a 'good till cancelled' order, meaning it will stay active until it's either filled or cancelled.

Please note that this is a very basic example and doesn't include any error handling or data gathering. You should expand this code to fit your needs, taking into account things like checking your available balance, handling potential API errors, and storing the data from your trades.
