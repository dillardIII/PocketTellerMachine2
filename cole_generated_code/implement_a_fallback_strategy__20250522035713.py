Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This example assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` which runs a backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, the function returns `None`.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function would contain the code to run a backtest
    # For this example, we'll just return None
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")

    # This is where you would put the code for your fallback strategy
    # For this example, we'll just print a message
    print("Fallback strategy completed.")

def main():
    # Run the backtest
    results = run_backtest()

    # If no results were found, run the fallback strategy
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")

main()
```

In this example, the `main()` function runs the backtest and checks if any results were found. If no results were found, it runs the `fallback_strategy()` function. You would replace the print statements in the `fallback_strategy()` function with the actual code for your fallback strategy.
