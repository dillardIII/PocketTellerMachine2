To analyze market trends and adjust trading parameters, we would need historical market data. We can use libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computation, matplotlib for plotting graphs, and sklearn for machine learning.

Here is a simple example of how you might start to approach this problem. This code does not actually adjust trading parameters or optimize potential wins, but it does demonstrate how you might start to analyze market trends using Python.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load historical market data into a pandas DataFrame
# For this example, let's assume we have a CSV file with market data
market_data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Let's assume the data has a 'Date' column and a 'Price' column
market_data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(market_data['Date'])
market_data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Calculate moving average
market_data['Moving_Avg'] = market_data['Price'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Plot the price and moving average
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.grid(True)
plt.plot(market_data['Price'],label='Price')
plt.plot(market_data['Moving_Avg'],label='Moving Average')
plt.legend(loc=2)

# Fit a linear regression model to the data to analyze trend
X = np.array(range(len(market_data))).reshape(-1, 1)
y = market_data['Price']
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Plot the trend line
trend_line = model.predict(X)
plt.plot(market_data.index, trend_line, label='Trend line')

plt.show()
```

This is a very basic example and doesn't include any trading strategy or parameter adjustment. In reality, developing a trading bot or algorithm is a complex task that requires deep understanding of both programming and financial markets. It's also important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results in trading.
