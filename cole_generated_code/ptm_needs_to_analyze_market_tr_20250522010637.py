Sure, to analyze market trends, we need to fetch market data first. We can use pandas_datareader library to fetch data from Yahoo Finance. Then we can use pandas to analyze the data. Here is a simple example:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# Fetch data
def fetch_data(stock, start_date, end_date):
    df = pdr.get_data_yahoo(stock, start=start_date, end=end_date)
    return df

# Analyze data
def analyze_data(df):
    # Calculate moving averages
    df['MA10'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
    df['MA50'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

    # Identify potential winning trades
    df['Buy_Signal'] = (df['MA10'] > df['MA50'])
    df['Sell_Signal'] = (df['MA10'] < df['MA50'])

    return df

# Fetch and analyze data
df = fetch_data('AAPL', '2020-01-01', '2021-12-31')
result = analyze_data(df)

# Print potential winning trades
print(result[result['Buy_Signal'] == True])
```

This code fetches the historical data for Apple Inc. from Yahoo Finance, calculates the 10-day and 50-day moving averages, and identifies potential winning trades where the 10-day moving average is greater than the 50-day moving average.

Please note that this is a very basic example of market trend analysis. In reality, market trend analysis involves much more complex statistical and machine learning techniques. Also, this code does not consider transaction costs and other factors that might affect the profitability of a trade.
