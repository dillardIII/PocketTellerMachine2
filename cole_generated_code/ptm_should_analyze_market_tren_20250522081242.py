To analyze market trends and opportunities for potential profitable trades, we can use Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download historical market data, and matplotlib for visualization. Here is a simple example of how you might do this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters
register_matplotlib_converters()

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2021-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Plot closing price and moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='AAPL Close Price', color='blue')
plt.plot(data['SMA_50'], label='50 Day SMA', color='red')
plt.plot(data['SMA_200'], label='200 Day SMA', color='green')
plt.title('Apple Close Price with Moving Averages')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Identify potential trades where the 50 day SMA crosses above the 200 day SMA
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['SMA_50'] > data['SMA_200']) & (data['SMA_50'].shift(1) < data['SMA_200'].shift(1))
buy_signals = data[data['Buy_Signal']]

print(buy_signals)
```

This script downloads historical data for Apple (AAPL), calculates 50 and 200 day simple moving averages (SMA), and plots these along with the closing price. It then identifies potential buy signals where the 50 day SMA crosses above the 200 day SMA, which is a common trading strategy.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms are much more complex, taking into account many more factors and using more sophisticated statistical methods. Always do your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making trading decisions.
