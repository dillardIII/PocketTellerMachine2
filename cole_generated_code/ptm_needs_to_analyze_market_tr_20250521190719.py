To analyze market trends, we can use Python's libraries like pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for data visualization. We can fetch the data from various sources like Yahoo Finance using pandas_datareader library.

Here is a simple Python code that fetches the historical data of a specific stock, calculates its moving averages and visualizes the data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas_datareader import data as web

# Fetching the historical data
def fetch_data(stock, start, end):
    df = web.DataReader(stock, 'yahoo', start, end)
    return df

# Calculating the moving averages
def calculate_moving_averages(df, short_window, long_window):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0
    signals['short_mavg'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
    signals['long_mavg'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()
    return signals

# Visualizing the data
def plot_data(df, signals):
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111, ylabel='Price in $')
    df['Close'].plot(ax=ax1, color='r', lw=2.)
    signals[['short_mavg', 'long_mavg']].plot(ax=ax1, lw=2.)
    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == 1.0].index, signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == 1.0], '^', markersize=10, color='m')
    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == -1.0].index, signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == -1.0], 'v', markersize=10, color='k')
    plt.show()

# Fetching the data
df = fetch_data('AAPL', '01-01-2010', '01-01-2022')

# Calculating the moving averages
signals = calculate_moving_averages(df, 40, 100)

# Plotting the data
plot_data(df, signals)
```

This code fetches the historical data of Apple Inc. from 2010 to 2022, calculates the short-term (40 days) and long-term (100 days) moving averages, and plots the data. The green triangles represent the points where the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average (buy signal), and the red triangles represent the points where the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average (sell signal).

Please note that this is a very basic form of trend analysis and should not be used for making real trading decisions. For a more sophisticated analysis, you might want to consider other factors like volume, other technical indicators, news, etc. Also, you might want to backtest your trading strategy before applying it to real trading.
