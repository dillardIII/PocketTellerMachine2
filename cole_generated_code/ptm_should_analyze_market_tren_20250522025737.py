Creating a Python program to analyze market trends and patterns is a complex task that involves multiple steps. It requires knowledge of financial markets, data analysis, and machine learning. Here is a simplified example of how you might start to approach this problem using Python and pandas library. This code will fetch historical data, calculate simple moving average and identify potential trading opportunities based on that.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

yf.pdr_override()

# Fetch historical market data
data = pdr.get_data_yahoo("AAPL", start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

# Calculate 20 days Simple Moving Average (SMA)
data['SMA_20'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate 50 days Simple Moving Average (SMA)
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Define a signal flag
data['Signal_Flag'] = 0.0
data['Signal_Flag'][data['SMA_20'] > data['SMA_50']] = 1.0

# Generate trading orders
data['Position'] = data['Signal_Flag'].diff()

# Print data
print(data)
```

In this code, we are calculating 20 days and 50 days simple moving averages (SMA). When the short-term average (20 days) is above the long-term average (50 days), it could be considered as a buying signal and vice versa.

Please note that this is a very simplified strategy and may not be profitable in real trading. In reality, you would need to consider many other factors and possibly use more advanced techniques like machine learning to predict market movements. Always consult with a financial advisor before making trading decisions.

Also, you need to install yfinance and pandas_datareader libraries if not already installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas_datareader
```
