To develop and implement trading strategies, you would need to use historical data to analyze trends, make predictions, and develop a strategy based on those predictions. Here's a simple example of how you might do this in Python using a moving average strategy.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and may not necessarily increase the chance of wins. Trading involves risk and this should not be taken as financial advice.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf

yf.pdr_override()

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Collect data on this ticker
tickerData = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickerSymbol, start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# Calculate the short-term exponential moving average (EMA)
ShortEMA = tickerData.Close.ewm(span=12, adjust=False).mean()

# Calculate the long-term exponential moving average (EMA)
LongEMA = tickerData.Close.ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()

# Create signals based on the crossover of short and long EMA
tickerData['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(ShortEMA > LongEMA, 1, 0)
tickerData['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(ShortEMA < LongEMA, 1, 0)

# Print the DataFrame
print(tickerData)
```

In this code, we use Yahoo Finance to get historical data on a specific ticker (in this case, Apple). We then calculate the short-term and long-term exponential moving averages (EMA) of the closing prices. When the short-term EMA is above the long-term EMA, this is typically seen as a bullish signal, and we mark these instances with a 'Buy_Signal'. Conversely, when the short-term EMA is below the long-term EMA, this is typically seen as a bearish signal, and we mark these instances with a 'Sell_Signal'. 

This is a very basic trading strategy and there are many other factors to consider when developing a trading strategy. Always do your own research and consider seeking advice from a financial advisor.
