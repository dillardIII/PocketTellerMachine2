Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the program will print a message and then proceed to execute the fallback strategy.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest logic
    # Replace it with your actual backtest code
    try:
        results = strategy.backtest()  # Run backtest
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Backtest failed with error: {e}")
        results = None

    return results

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your fallback strategy
    # Replace it with your actual fallback strategy code
    print("Executing fallback strategy...")

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest_strategy(strategy)
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found. Proceeding with strategy...")
        # Continue with your normal strategy execution

# Replace 'my_strategy' with your actual strategy
execute_strategy(my_strategy)
```

In this code, `backtest_strategy` is a function that runs the backtest for a given strategy. If the backtest fails for any reason (e.g., no data, error in the strategy logic), it catches the exception and returns `None`.

`fallback_strategy` is a function that contains the logic for your fallback strategy. This could be anything you want, such as executing a default strategy, sending a notification, or even stopping the program.

`execute_strategy` is a function that tries to execute a given strategy. If the backtest results are `None`, it executes the fallback strategy. Otherwise, it proceeds with the normal strategy execution.
