Sure, I can provide a simple example of how you might analyze market trends and patterns using Python. For this example, I'll use the pandas library to handle data, yfinance to download stock data, and matplotlib to plot data.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and consider many more factors. Also, remember that trading stocks always comes with risks.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters

register_matplotlib_converters()

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'
tickerData = yf.Ticker(ticker)
df = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# Calculate the simple moving average
df['SMA_50'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
df['SMA_200'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Plot closing price along with the moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(df['Close'], label=ticker)
plt.plot(df['SMA_50'], label='50 day rolling SMA')
plt.plot(df['SMA_200'], label='200 day rolling SMA')
plt.title('Historical Stock Value')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Stock Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Define a signal for trading opportunities
df['Signal'] = 0.0
df['Signal'][df['SMA_50'] > df['SMA_200']] = 1.0

# Identify potential trading opportunities
trading_opportunities = df[df['Signal'].diff() != 0]
print(trading_opportunities)
```

This script will download the historical data for a given ticker symbol, calculate the 50 and 200 day simple moving averages, and plot these along with the closing price. It then defines a basic trading signal: if the 50 day moving average is greater than the 200 day moving average, this could be a trading opportunity. The script then identifies and prints out these potential trading opportunities.

This is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and consider many more factors. Also, remember that trading stocks always comes with risks.
