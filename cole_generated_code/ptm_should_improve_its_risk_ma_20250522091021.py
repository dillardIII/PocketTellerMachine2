As an AI, I can provide you with a Python code example that could be used as a part of a risk management system. However, the risk management system is a complex structure that involves not only programming but also financial expertise, regulations, and company policies. Here's a simple example of how you might use Python to calculate Value at Risk (VaR), a risk management technique:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import fix_yahoo_finance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# Fetching data
def fetch_data(stock_name, start_date, end_date):
    data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(stock_name, start=start_date, end=end_date)
    return data['Adj Close']

# Calculating VaR
def calculate_var(stock_name, start_date, end_date, confidence_level):
    data = fetch_data(stock_name, start_date, end_date)
    returns = data.pct_change()
    mean = np.mean(returns)
    std_dev = np.std(returns)
    var = abs(np.percentile(returns, 100 - confidence_level))
    return var

# Example usage
stock_name = 'PTM'
start_date = '2020-01-01'
end_date = '2022-12-31'
confidence_level = 95 # 95% confidence level

var = calculate_var(stock_name, start_date, end_date, confidence_level)
print('Value at Risk at {} confidence level is {}'.format(confidence_level, var))
```

This code calculates the Value at Risk (VaR) for a specific stock over a specific time period at a specific confidence level. VaR is a statistical technique used to measure and quantify the level of financial risk within a firm or investment portfolio over a specific time frame. This metric is most commonly used by investment and commercial banks to determine the extent and occurrence ratio of potential losses in their institutional portfolios.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world risk management systems are much more complex and involve many other factors and calculations.
