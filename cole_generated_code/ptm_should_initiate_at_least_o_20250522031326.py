Sure, here's a simple Python code that uses the `alpaca-trade-api` package to initiate a trade. This code assumes that you have an Alpaca account and you've set your API key ID and secret key as environment variables.

```python
import os
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up Alpaca API environment
api = tradeapi.REST()

# Define the stock to trade and the number of shares
symbol = 'AAPL'
qty = 1

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (AAPL)
order = api.submit_order(
    symbol=symbol,
    qty=qty,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)

print(f"Submitted order to buy {qty} share(s) of {symbol}")
```

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock at the current market price. Please replace `'AAPL'` and `1` with the symbol of the stock and the number of shares you want to trade, respectively.

Please note that trading involves risks and this code is for educational purposes only. Always do your own research before making any trading decisions.

Also, please make sure to handle exceptions and edge cases in your production code.
