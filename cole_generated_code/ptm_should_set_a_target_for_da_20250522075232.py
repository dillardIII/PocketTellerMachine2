Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that sets a target for daily wins.

```python
class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.daily_target = 0

    def set_daily_target(self, target):
        self.daily_target = target
        print(f"Daily target for wins has been set to: {self.daily_target}")

# Create an instance of PTM
ptm = PTM()

# Set daily target
ptm.set_daily_target(1000)
```

In this code, we have a class `PTM` with a method `set_daily_target` that sets the daily target for wins. You can change the target by calling this method with the new target as the argument. The current target is printed every time it's set. 

Please note that this is a very basic implementation. In a real-world scenario, you would probably want to add more features, such as checking if the target is reached, handling different types of trades, etc.
