Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. I'll assume that your backtest function returns None when no results are found. 

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest function
    # It should return the backtest results if they exist, otherwise None
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your fallback strategy
    # It should return the results of the fallback strategy
    pass

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy.")
        results = fallback_strategy()
    return results

# Execute the strategy
strategy = "Your trading strategy here"
results = execute_strategy(strategy)
```

In this example, the `execute_strategy` function attempts to backtest the given strategy. If no results are found (i.e., `backtest` returns `None`), it executes the fallback strategy instead.
