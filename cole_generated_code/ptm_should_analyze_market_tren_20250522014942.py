To analyze market trends and adjust trading strategies, we would need to use a combination of data analysis, machine learning and possibly some form of AI. Here's a simplified example of how you might start to approach this problem using Python.

First, we need to import necessary libraries:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
```

Next, we would need to load our market data. For this example, let's assume we have a CSV file with historical market data:

```python
# Load data
market_data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')
```

We would then need to prepare our data for machine learning:

```python
# Select target
y = market_data.target

# To keep things simple, we'll use only numerical predictors
market_predictors = market_data.select_dtypes(exclude=['object'])

# Divide data into training and validation subsets
X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(market_predictors, y, train_size=0.8, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)
```

We can now define and fit our model:

```python
# Define the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)

# Fit the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

We can then make predictions and evaluate the model:

```python
# Get predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_valid)

# Calculate MAE
mae = mean_absolute_error(predictions, y_valid)

print("Mean Absolute Error: ", mae)
```

Finally, we would need to implement a function to adjust our trading strategies based on the market trends predicted by our model. This is highly dependent on the specific trading strategies being used and the structure of the market data, so it's not possible to provide a specific implementation without more information.

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would likely need to use more advanced techniques for data preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, and model tuning. You would also need to ensure that your data is up-to-date and that your model is retrained regularly to reflect recent market trends.
