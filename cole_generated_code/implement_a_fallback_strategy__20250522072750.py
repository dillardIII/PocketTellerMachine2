Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, we will return a message saying "No backtest results found".

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    # This is a placeholder for the actual function that gets backtest results
    # In a real scenario, this would likely involve querying a database or an API
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy...")

def main():
    backtest_results = get_backtest_results()
    if backtest_results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Continue with normal processing
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results()` is a placeholder for the function that would actually get the backtest results. If this function returns `None`, which we're using to indicate that no results were found, then we call `fallback_strategy()`.

The `fallback_strategy()` function could be expanded to include whatever fallback behavior is appropriate for your application. For example, it might involve using a default set of results, notifying the user, or taking some other action.
