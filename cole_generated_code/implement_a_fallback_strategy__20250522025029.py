Sure, here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs a backtest and returns results. If no results are found, it will run a fallback strategy.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function should run a backtest and return the results
    # For the purpose of this example, it just returns None
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement a fallback strategy
    # For the purpose of this example, it just prints a message
    print("Running fallback strategy...")

def main():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")

main()
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` is a placeholder for your actual backtesting function, and `fallback_strategy()` is a placeholder for your actual fallback strategy. You would need to replace these with your actual functions.

If `run_backtest()` returns `None`, this means that no backtest results were found, so the fallback strategy is executed. If `run_backtest()` returns something other than `None`, this means that backtest results were found, so no action is taken.
