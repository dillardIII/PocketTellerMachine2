Here's one way to do it:

First, you would typically have a function to conduct the backtest and return the results.
Let's assume that this function is called `conduct_backtest()` and it returns None when no results are found.

If no backtest results are found, it will trigger a backup strategy. I will create a function for this backup strategy and call it `fallback_strategy()`.

```python
def conduct_backtest():
    # Your code here to perform the backtest
    # Return None if no results are found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your fallback strategy when no backtest results are found
    print("Fallback strategy initiated...")
    # Implement your fallback strategy here
    pass

def main():
    backtest_results = conduct_backtest()
    if backtest_results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found, proceeding as planned.")
        # Your code here to proceed with the backtest_results
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This is a very basic implementation and you should modify this according to your requirements. For example, you may want to have the `conduct_backtest()` function throw an exception when no results are found, you may want to return certain values from the `fallback_strategy()`, or you may want to have different sorts of fallback strategies and choose one based on certain conditions, etc.

If you need further help, could you please provide more specific information?
