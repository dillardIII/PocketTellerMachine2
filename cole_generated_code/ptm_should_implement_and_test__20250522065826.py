Sure, I can provide you with a basic structure of how you can implement a trading strategy in Python. However, please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading strategies involve much more complexity and risk management.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

class TradingStrategy:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.model = RandomForestRegressor()

    def preprocess_data(self):
        # Preprocess the data
        # This is a placeholder. In real-world scenario, you would perform actual preprocessing here
        return self.data

    def train_model(self):
        # Split the data
        X = self.data.drop('target', axis=1)
        y = self.data['target']
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

        # Train the model
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)

        # Test the model
        score = self.model.score(X_test, y_test)
        print(f"Model accuracy: {score}")

    def predict(self, new_data):
        # Predict the target for new data
        prediction = self.model.predict(new_data)
        return prediction

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Create a new trading strategy
strategy = TradingStrategy(data)

# Preprocess the data
strategy.preprocess_data()

# Train the model
strategy.train_model()

# Predict for new data
new_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(0,100,size=(100, 4)), columns=list('ABCD'))
prediction = strategy.predict(new_data)
print(f"Predictions: {prediction}")
```

In this example, we're using a Random Forest Regressor as our model. The model is trained on a dataset that you provide. The `preprocess_data` method is where you would perform any preprocessing on your data. The `train_model` method splits the data into training and testing sets, trains the model, and then tests it. The `predict` method is used to make predictions on new data.

Please replace `'your_data.csv'` and `new_data` with your actual data. Also, you might need to replace `'target'` with the actual name of your target variable.
