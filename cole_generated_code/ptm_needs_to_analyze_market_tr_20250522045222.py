Here is a basic Python code that uses the `pandas` library to analyze market trends. This code assumes that you have historical market data in a CSV file. The code reads the data, calculates the moving average and plots it. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Calculate the moving average
data['Moving_Avg'] = data['Price'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Plot the price and moving average
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(data['Price'], label='Price')
plt.plot(data['Moving_Avg'], label='Moving Average', color='red')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.title('Market Trends')
plt.show()
```

This is a very basic analysis. Depending on the specific needs of PTM, you might need to use more advanced techniques and more specific data. For example, you might want to analyze the trends for specific stocks, or you might want to use different indicators (not just the moving average). 

Please note that this code does not identify potential winning trades. Identifying winning trades involves predicting future price movements, which is a complex task that requires advanced machine learning techniques. 

Also, keep in mind that trading involves risk and it's possible to lose money even with sophisticated analysis and prediction techniques.
