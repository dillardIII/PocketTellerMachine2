Sure, here is a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the function will return a message stating that no results were found and the fallback strategy will be used.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume we have a function get_backtest_results that returns backtest results
    # If no results are found, it returns None
    backtest_results = get_backtest_results(strategy)

    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Implement your fallback strategy here
        fallback_strategy = "Fallback Strategy"
        return fallback_strategy

    # If backtest results are found, return them
    return backtest_results

# Test the function with a strategy
strategy = "Strategy 1"
print(backtest_strategy(strategy))
```

Please note that this is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to define the `get_backtest_results` function and the fallback strategy according to your specific requirements.
