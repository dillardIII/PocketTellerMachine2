Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This example assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs a backtest and returns the results, or `None` if no results are found.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function should run your backtest and return the results, or None if no results are found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement your fallback strategy
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")
    pass

# Run the backtest
backtest_results = run_backtest()

# If no results are found, run the fallback strategy
if backtest_results is None:
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    print("Backtest results found.")
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` are placeholders for your actual backtest and fallback strategy implementations. You would need to replace these with your actual code.
