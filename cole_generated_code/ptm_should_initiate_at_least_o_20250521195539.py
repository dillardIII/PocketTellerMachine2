To initiate a trade, we would need to use an API provided by a trading platform. Here is an example of how it could be done using the Alpaca API. Please replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your actual Alpaca API keys.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

def initiate_trade():
    # Define the stock symbol and the number of shares
    symbol = 'AAPL'
    qty = 1

    # Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock
    order = api.submit_order(
        symbol=symbol,
        qty=qty,
        side='buy',
        type='market',
        time_in_force='gtc'
    )

    return order

# Initiate a trade
trade = initiate_trade()
print(trade)
```

This script will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock. The trade data will be returned by the `initiate_trade` function and printed to the console.

Please note that this is a hypothetical example and should not be used for actual trading without proper modifications and understanding. Always ensure that you understand the API documentation and the trading platform's rules and regulations before initiating any trades.
