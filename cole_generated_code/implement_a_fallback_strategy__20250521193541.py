Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # Assume this function performs backtesting and returns results
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is your fallback strategy when no backtest results are found
    print("No backtest results found, executing fallback strategy...")

# Main function
def main():
    strategy = "Your trading strategy"
    backtest_results = backtest(strategy)

    if backtest_results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found, proceeding with the strategy...")

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, the `backtest` function is assumed to perform the backtesting of your trading strategy and return the results. If no results are found (i.e., `backtest` returns `None`), the `fallback_strategy` function is called. You can replace the `fallback_strategy` function with your actual fallback strategy.

Please note that this is a very simplified example. Depending on your actual use case, you might need to handle exceptions, log errors, etc.
