Sorry for the misunderstanding, but implementing trading strategies into Python code would need a comprehensive and detailed description of strategies, including the specific trading conditions, calculations, parameters, and solutions to handle different scenarios. 

However, I can give an example that implements a simple Moving Average Crossover strategy using Python and the Pandas library. The strategy consists of two moving averages, one slow (longer period) and one fast (shorter period). When the fast MA crosses the slow MA from below, we'll buy; when it crosses from above, we'll sell. 

Here is a basic outline of how you might implement this with Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for required stocks
ticker = "AAPL"
ticker_data = yf.download(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-01-01")

# Calculate moving averages
ticker_data['MA_Fast'] = ticker_data['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
ticker_data['MA_Slow'] = ticker_data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Define a function to signal when to buy and sell
def implement_ma_strategy(data):

    buy_signals = []
    sell_signals = []
    flag = -1

    # Loops through the data
    for i in range(len(data)):
       if data['MA_Fast'][i] > data['MA_Slow'][i]:
          if flag != 1:
              buy_signals.append(data['Close'][i])
              sell_signals.append(np.nan)
              flag = 1
          else:
              buy_signals.append(np.nan)
              sell_signals.append(np.nan)
       elif data['MA_Fast'][i] < data['MA_Slow'][i]:
          if flag != 0:
              sell_signals.append(data['Close'][i])
              buy_signals.append(np.nan)
              flag = 0
          else:
              buy_signals.append(np.nan)
              sell_signals.append(np.nan)
       else:
          buy_signals.append(np.nan)
          sell_signals.append(np.nan)

    return buy_signals, sell_signals

# Calling the function and storing the signals in variables
ticker_data['Buy_Signal'], ticker_data['Sell_Signal'] = implement_ma_strategy(ticker_data)

# Print DataFrame
print(ticker_data)
```

Please note that the financial trading industry has a lot of risks associated with it and automated trading should always be supervised. Before implementing such automated strategies, it would be advisable to understand the theoretical concepts clearly and also backtest the strategies using historical data to understand how it would have performed under different market conditions. Always keep in mind that past performance is not an indicator of future results.

Also, the code provided is general in nature and does not take into account individual circumstances, objectives, or needs. Always consult a financial advisor or trading expert before making such decisions.
