To accomplish this task, we would need to use a machine learning model to analyze market trends and adjust trading parameters. Here's a simplified example using Python, pandas for data manipulation and sklearn for machine learning:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load market data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Define features and target
features = data.drop('target', axis=1)
target = data['target']

# Split data into training and testing sets
features_train, features_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and fit the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(features_train, target_train)

# Predict target values
target_pred = model.predict(features_test)

# Calculate error
error = mean_squared_error(target_test, target_pred)

# Print error
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {error}')

# Adjust trading parameters based on the model
parameters = model.coef_
print(f'Trading Parameters: {parameters}')
```

This is a very simplified example and real-world trading models are much more complex. They would take into account many more factors, use more complex models and also use real-time data. Also, this example assumes that you have a CSV file named 'market_data.csv' which contains your market data, and that 'target' is the column you want to predict.

Please replace 'market_data.csv' and 'target' with your actual data file and target column. Also, please note that this is a very basic model for illustrative purposes and might not give accurate results for actual trading.
