Sure, here's a simple way to implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this example, I'll assume that the backtest results are obtained from a function called `run_backtest()`, which returns `None` if no results are found.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function runs the backtest and returns the results.
    # If no results are found, it returns None.
    # The actual implementation of this function will depend on your specific backtesting setup.
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function implements the fallback strategy.
    # The actual implementation will depend on what you want to do when no backtest results are found.
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")
    pass

# Run the backtest
backtest_results = run_backtest()

# If no results are found, run the fallback strategy
if backtest_results is None:
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    print("Backtest results found:", backtest_results)
```

This is a very basic example. Depending on your specific needs, you might want to add more complex error handling, logging, etc.
