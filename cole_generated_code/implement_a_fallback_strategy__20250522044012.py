Sure, here is a simple Python code that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume we have a function `run_backtest` that runs the backtest
    # and returns a dictionary with the results or None if no results were found
    results = run_backtest(strategy)
    
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Falling back to default strategy.")
        # Fallback strategy: return an empty dictionary
        return {}
    else:
        return results
```

This is a very basic fallback strategy. Depending on your specific needs and the context in which this function is used, you might want to implement a different fallback strategy. For example, you could try a different trading strategy, use a default set of results, or raise an exception.
