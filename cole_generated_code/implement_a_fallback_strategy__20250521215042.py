Sure, here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that returns backtest results. If no results are found, the fallback strategy is executed.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function should return backtest results
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
    # Implement your fallback strategy here
    pass

def main():
    backtest_results = run_backtest()
    if not backtest_results:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found. Proceeding with normal strategy...")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` is a placeholder function that should be replaced with your actual backtesting function. The `fallback_strategy()` function is where you should implement your fallback strategy. The `main()` function runs the backtest and checks if any results were found. If no results were found, it calls the fallback strategy. Otherwise, it proceeds with the normal strategy.
