Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading involves complex algorithms and considerations.

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, trader_name, balance):
        self.trader_name = trader_name
        self.balance = balance
        self.experience = 0

    def initiate_trade(self, trade_amount):
        if trade_amount > self.balance:
            return "Insufficient balance to initiate trade."
        else:
            self.balance -= trade_amount
            self.experience += 1
            return f"Trade initiated successfully. Current balance: {self.balance}, Experience: {self.experience}"

# create a trader named PTM with a balance of 10000
PTM = Trade('PTM', 10000)

# PTM initiates a trade with an amount of 1000
print(PTM.initiate_trade(1000))
```

In this code, a `Trade` class is created with attributes like `trader_name`, `balance`, and `experience`. The `initiate_trade` method is used to initiate a trade. If the trade amount is more than the balance, it returns an error message. Otherwise, it deducts the trade amount from the balance and increases the experience by 1. 

Finally, a trader named PTM is created with a balance of 10000. PTM initiates a trade with an amount of 1000. The result of the trade initiation is printed.
