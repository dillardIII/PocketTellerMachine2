Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. The fallback strategy could be anything you want, in this case, I will just print a message and return an empty list.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume we have a function `run_backtest` which runs the backtest
    # and returns a list of results. If no results are found, it returns None.
    results = run_backtest(strategy)

    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Falling back to default strategy.")
        # Fallback strategy can be anything. Here, we just return an empty list.
        return []
    else:
        return results
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the `run_backtest` function and the fallback strategy would depend on the specifics of your trading system.
