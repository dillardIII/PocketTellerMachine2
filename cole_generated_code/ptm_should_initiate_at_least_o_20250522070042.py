Sure, here is a simple example of a Python code that uses the Alpaca API to initiate a trade. Alpaca is a platform that allows users to build and trade with real-time market data for free.

Please note that you need to replace `YOUR_API_KEY_ID` and `YOUR_API_SECRET_KEY` with your actual Alpaca API key and secret.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up API connection
api = tradeapi.REST('YOUR_API_KEY_ID', 'YOUR_API_SECRET_KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Define the trading symbol and quantity
symbol = 'AAPL'
qty = 1

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol=symbol,
    qty=qty,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock at the current market price. The order type is 'market' and the time in force is 'gtc' (good till cancelled), which means the order will stay open until it is filled or cancelled.

Please note that this is a paper trading API endpoint, which means it simulates trades but does not actually execute them in the real stock market. This is useful for gaining practical experience without risking real money.

Before running this code, make sure to install the `alpaca-trade-api` Python library. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Also, please be aware that trading involves risk, and this code is provided as an example. Always do your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making trades.
