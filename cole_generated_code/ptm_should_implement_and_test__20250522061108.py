Sure, I can provide a basic structure for implementing and testing a simple trading strategy using Python. For this example, I'll use the Moving Average Crossover strategy, which is a popular strategy in algorithmic trading. 

Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading involves many more factors. Also, this example assumes that you have historical price data in a pandas DataFrame called 'df'.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

# Define the trading strategy
def calculate_signals(df):
    short_window = 40
    long_window = 100

    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Short moving average
    signals['short_mavg'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Long moving average
    signals['long_mavg'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                                > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   

    # Generate trading orders
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Fetch historical data
df = web.DataReader('AAPL', data_source='yahoo', start='01-01-2010', end='01-01-2022')

# Calculate signals
signals = calculate_signals(df)

# Print signals
print(signals)
```

This code will print a DataFrame where a 1 in the 'positions' column indicates a buy signal and a -1 indicates a sell signal. 

Please replace 'AAPL' with the ticker symbol of the stock you want to analyze and adjust the start and end dates as needed.

Also, remember to install necessary packages by running `pip install pandas pandas-datareader numpy`.

Please note that this is a simple strategy and might not be profitable in real trading. Always backtest your strategies with historical data before live trading.
