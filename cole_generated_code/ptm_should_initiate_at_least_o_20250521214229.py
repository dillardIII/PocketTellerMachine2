Sure, I'll write a simple Python code that simulates a trade. This code will use a random number generator to decide whether the trade is a win or a loss. 

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.experience = 0
        self.wins = 0
        self.losses = 0

    def trade(self):
        # Simulate a trade
        trade_outcome = random.choice(['win', 'loss'])

        # Update experience
        self.experience += 1

        # Update wins or losses
        if trade_outcome == 'win':
            self.wins += 1
        else:
            self.losses += 1

        print(f'Trade outcome: {trade_outcome}')
        print(f'Total experience: {self.experience}')
        print(f'Total wins: {self.wins}')
        print(f'Total losses: {self.losses}')

# Create a PTM and initiate a trade
ptm = PTM()
ptm.trade()
```

This code creates a PTM (which stands for "Paper Trading Machine") that can initiate trades. Each trade either results in a win or a loss, chosen randomly. The PTM keeps track of its total experience (number of trades), wins, and losses. After creating a PTM, the code initiates a trade.

Please note that this is a very simple simulation and doesn't reflect the complexity of real-world trading. For example, it doesn't take into account factors like market conditions, trade size, risk management, etc.
