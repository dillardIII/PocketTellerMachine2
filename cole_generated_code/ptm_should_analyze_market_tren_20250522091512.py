To analyze market trends and patterns, we need historical market data. We can use libraries like pandas, numpy, and yfinance to fetch and analyze this data. Here's a simple Python script that fetches historical data for a particular stock and calculates its moving averages to identify potential trading opportunities:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Fetch historical market data
def fetch_data(stock_symbol):
    data = yf.download(stock_symbol, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')
    return data

# Calculate moving averages
def calculate_moving_averages(data, short_window, long_window):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Short moving average
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Long moving average
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                                > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Plot data
def plot_data(data, signals):
    fig = plt.figure()

    ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111, ylabel='Price in $')
    data['Close'].plot(ax=ax1, color='r', lw=2.)
    signals[['short_mavg', 'long_mavg']].plot(ax=ax1, lw=2.)

    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == 1.0].index, 
             signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == 1.0],
             '^', markersize=10, color='m')
             
    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == -1.0].index, 
             signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == -1.0],
             'v', markersize=10, color='k')
             
    plt.show()

# Fetch data
data = fetch_data('AAPL')

# Calculate moving averages
signals = calculate_moving_averages(data, short_window=40, long_window=100)

# Plot data
plot_data(data, signals)
```

This script fetches historical data for Apple's stock (AAPL), calculates its 40-day and 100-day moving averages, and plots the data. The points where the short moving average crosses above the long moving average (potential buy signals) are marked with a '^', and the points where it crosses below (potential sell signals) are marked with a 'v'. 

Please note that this is a very basic form of analysis and should not be used for actual trading without further enhancements.
