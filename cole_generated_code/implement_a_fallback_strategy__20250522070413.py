Sure, here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that runs the backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, the fallback strategy is executed.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function should run the backtest and return the results
    # For the sake of this example, it will return None
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement the fallback strategy
    print("Running fallback strategy...")

def main():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")
        # Process the results

main()
```

Please replace the `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` functions with your actual implementation. The `run_backtest()` function should return the backtest results, and the `fallback_strategy()` function should implement the fallback strategy when no backtest results are found.
