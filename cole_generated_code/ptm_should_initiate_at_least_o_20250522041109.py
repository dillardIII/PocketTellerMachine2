Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code that initiates a trade. However, please note that this is a very simplified version and real-world trading involves much more complexities.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # starting balance
        self.stock_price = 100  # hypothetical stock price
        self.stock_owned = 0  # starting stock owned

    def buy_stock(self, num_stocks):
        if self.balance >= num_stocks * self.stock_price:
            self.balance -= num_stocks * self.stock_price
            self.stock_owned += num_stocks
            print(f"PTM bought {num_stocks} stocks.")
        else:
            print("PTM doesn't have enough balance to buy stocks.")

    def sell_stock(self, num_stocks):
        if self.stock_owned >= num_stocks:
            self.balance += num_stocks * self.stock_price
            self.stock_owned -= num_stocks
            print(f"PTM sold {num_stocks} stocks.")
        else:
            print("PTM doesn't have enough stocks to sell.")

    def evaluate_strategy(self):
        # Here we just randomly decide whether to buy or sell
        if random.choice(['buy', 'sell']) == 'buy':
            self.buy_stock(1)
        else:
            self.sell_stock(1)
        print(f"PTM's current balance: {self.balance}")
        print(f"PTM's current stock owned: {self.stock_owned}")


ptm = PTM()
for _ in range(10):  # initiate 10 trades
    ptm.evaluate_strategy()
```

In this code, we have a `PTM` class that represents the trading model. It has methods to buy and sell stocks, and a method to evaluate the strategy. In the `evaluate_strategy` method, we randomly decide whether to buy or sell a stock. This is a very naive strategy and is used just for demonstration. In a real-world scenario, the strategy would be based on various factors like market trends, historical data, etc.
