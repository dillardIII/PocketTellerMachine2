In order to analyze market trends and adjust strategies accordingly, we would need to use some kind of machine learning or data analysis library. Here is a simple example of how you might start to set up such a system using the pandas library for data analysis and the yfinance library to get stock market data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_moving_average(data, window_size):
    return data['Close'].rolling(window=window_size).mean()

def analyze_trends(symbol):
    data = yf.download(symbol, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')
    data['MA10'] = calculate_moving_average(data, 10)
    data['MA50'] = calculate_moving_average(data, 50)
    return data

def adjust_strategy(data):
    buy_signals = []
    sell_signals = []
    for i in range(len(data)):
        if data['MA10'].iloc[i] > data['MA50'].iloc[i]:
            buy_signals.append(data['Close'].iloc[i])
            sell_signals.append(float('nan'))
        elif data['MA10'].iloc[i] < data['MA50'].iloc[i]:
            sell_signals.append(data['Close'].iloc[i])
            buy_signals.append(float('nan'))
        else:
            buy_signals.append(float('nan'))
            sell_signals.append(float('nan'))
    return buy_signals, sell_signals

symbol = 'AAPL'
data = analyze_trends(symbol)
buy_signals, sell_signals = adjust_strategy(data)

data['Buy_Signal_Price'] = buy_signals
data['Sell_Signal_Price'] = sell_signals
data.to_csv('trading_strategy.csv')
```

This code will download the historical market data for a given symbol (in this case, 'AAPL' for Apple Inc.), calculate the 10-day and 50-day moving averages of the closing prices, and then generate buy and sell signals based on these moving averages. If the 10-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average, this indicates an upward trend and a buy signal is generated. If the 10-day moving average is below the 50-day moving average, this indicates a downward trend and a sell signal is generated. The resulting data, including the buy and sell signals, is then saved to a CSV file.

Please note that this is a very simple trading strategy and is unlikely to be profitable without further refinement. It is intended as a starting point for developing a more sophisticated trading algorithm.
