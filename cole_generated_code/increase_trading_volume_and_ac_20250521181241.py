To increase trading volume and activity levels, you will need to implement some trading strategies. Here is an example of breakout strategy implemented in Python. Also, the potential win-loss ratios can be calculated by dividing the number of winning trades by the number of losing trades. Please note the following code is a simple illustration and may need to be further adjusted based on specific trading rules.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class TradingStrategy:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.buy_price = 0
        self.sell_price = 0
        self.total_profit = 0
        self.win_trades = 0
        self.loss_trades = 0

    def calculate_ratio(self):
        if self.loss_trades == 0:
            return "Infinity"
        else:
            return self.win_trades / self.loss_trades

    def implement_strategy(self):
        for i in range(1, len(self.data)):
            if self.data[i] > self.data[i-1]:
                if self.buy_price == 0:
                    self.buy_price = self.data[i]
                else:
                    sell_price = self.data[i]
                    profit = sell_price - self.buy_price
                    if profit > 0:
                        self.win_trades += 1
                    else:
                        self.loss_trades += 1
                    self.total_profit += profit
                    self.buy_price = 0
        return self.calculate_ratio()

# Assume we get the trading volume data
data = pd.Series(np.random.randn(100))
strategy = TradingStrategy(data)
win_loss_ratio = strategy.implement_strategy()
print(f'The win-loss ratio is: {win_loss_ratio}')
```

This Python code simulates a trading strategy where stocks are purchased when the price goes up and sold when the price goes down trying to capture upward trends. The win-loss ratio is calculated by dividing the number of winning trades with the number of losing trades.
