Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade using a hypothetical trading API:

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, symbol, quantity, price):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.price = price

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # starting balance
        self.portfolio = {}  # stocks owned

    def buy(self, trade):
        cost = trade.quantity * trade.price
        if cost > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient balance to execute trade.")
            return
        self.balance -= cost
        self.portfolio[trade.symbol] = self.portfolio.get(trade.symbol, 0) + trade.quantity
        print(f"Bought {trade.quantity} of {trade.symbol} at {trade.price} each. Remaining balance: {self.balance}")

    def sell(self, trade):
        if trade.symbol not in self.portfolio or self.portfolio[trade.symbol] < trade.quantity:
            print("Insufficient stocks to execute trade.")
            return
        self.portfolio[trade.symbol] -= trade.quantity
        if self.portfolio[trade.symbol] == 0:
            del self.portfolio[trade.symbol]
        self.balance += trade.quantity * trade.price
        print(f"Sold {trade.quantity} of {trade.symbol} at {trade.price} each. Remaining balance: {self.balance}")

# Create PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a buy trade
buy_trade = Trade("AAPL", 10, 150)
ptm.buy(buy_trade)

# Initiate a sell trade
sell_trade = Trade("AAPL", 5, 200)
ptm.sell(sell_trade)
```

This code creates a simple trading system where you can buy and sell stocks. It keeps track of your balance and the stocks you own. Please note that this is a very simplified version of a trading system and does not consider many factors that a real trading system would need to consider, such as market orders, limit orders, stop orders, short selling, etc. Also, it does not connect to a real trading API, it's just a simulation.
