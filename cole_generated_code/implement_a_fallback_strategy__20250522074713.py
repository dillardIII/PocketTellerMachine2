Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This function assumes that you have a function named `run_backtest` that returns backtest results, and a function named `fallback_strategy` that is executed when no backtest results are found.

```python
def execute_strategy():
    backtest_results = run_backtest()

    if not backtest_results:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy.")
        fallback_results = fallback_strategy()
        return fallback_results

    return backtest_results
```

In this function, `run_backtest()` is supposed to return the backtest results. If it returns an empty result (which could be an empty list, `None`, `False`, etc., depending on how you've implemented it), the function prints a message and then calls `fallback_strategy()`. The results of the fallback strategy are then returned. If `run_backtest()` does return results, those results are returned immediately.

Please replace `run_backtest` and `fallback_strategy` with your actual functions.
