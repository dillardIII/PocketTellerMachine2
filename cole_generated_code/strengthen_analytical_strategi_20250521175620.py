To strengthen analytical strategies to identify profitable trading opportunities, aspects such as moving averages, momentum indicators, Bollinger Bands, and others can be used. Below is a simplistic example of a moving average crossover strategy implemented in Python using the `pandas` and `yfinance` libraries.

Before proceeding, make sure you have the necessary packages installed. If not, you can install them with:
```
pip install pandas yfinance matplotlib
```
Here's the Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    return data.rolling(window=window).mean()

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def plot_graph(data, sma, ema):
    plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.plot(data, label='data')
    plt.plot(sma, label='SMA')
    plt.plot(ema, label='EMA')
    plt.legend(loc=2)
    plt.show()

def moving_average_strategy(data):
    # Calculate SMA and EMA
    sma = calculate_sma(data['Close'], 14)
    ema = calculate_ema(data['Close'], 14)

    # Create signals
    buy_signal = (sma < ema)
    sell_signal = (sma > ema)

    # Plotting
    plot_graph(data['Close'], sma, ema)

    return buy_signal, sell_signal

# Fetch data
data = yf.download('AAPL','2019-1-1','2020-12-31')

buy_signal, sell_signal = moving_average_strategy(data)

print("Buy signals:\n", buy_signal)
print("\nSell signals:\n", sell_signal)
```

This code fetches the historical stock data for Apple Inc., then calculates the 14-day simple moving average (SMA) and exponential moving average (EMA) for the closing prices. It generates buy signals when the SMA is less than the EMA, and sell signals when the SMA is greater than the EMA. Finally, it plots these moving averages and closing prices on a graph.

In real scenarios, more complex strategies and factors would be considered based on the investor's preference. Adjusting the window size of the moving averages and incorporating additional technical indicators may yield varying results. Please exercise discretion and consult with a financial advisor for accurate information.

This code should not be used for real trading without proper modification and understanding. Market investment/ trading has its own risks.
