Sure, here's a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. This code doesn't actually perform any real trades, but it gives you an idea of how a trading bot might work. 

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.experience = 0
        self.wins = 0
        self.losses = 0

    def trade(self):
        # Simulate a trade
        trade_outcome = random.choice(['win', 'loss'])
        
        # Update experience
        self.experience += 1

        # Update wins or losses
        if trade_outcome == 'win':
            self.wins += 1
        else:
            self.losses += 1

        return trade_outcome

# Create a PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
trade_outcome = ptm.trade()

print(f"Trade Outcome: {trade_outcome}")
print(f"Experience: {ptm.experience}")
print(f"Wins: {ptm.wins}")
print(f"Losses: {ptm.losses}")
```

In this code, the `PTM` class represents a trading bot. The `trade` method simulates a trade by randomly selecting a 'win' or 'loss'. The bot's experience, wins, and losses are updated accordingly. 

Please note that in a real-world scenario, the `trade` method would involve complex algorithms and real-time data to decide when to buy or sell.
