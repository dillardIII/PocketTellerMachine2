To analyze market trends and adjust trading algorithms, we would need to have access to market data. This data could be obtained from various sources such as APIs provided by financial institutions or financial data providers. 

Here is a simple example of how you might analyze market trends using Python. In this example, we'll use the pandas library to analyze stock data from Yahoo Finance.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms can be extremely complex and involve many other factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
def download_data(stock, start_date, end_date):
    data = yf.download(stock, start_date, end_date)
    return data

# Calculate trend based on historical stock data
def calculate_trend(data):
    data = data.reset_index()
    data['Date'] = data.index
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(data['Date'].values.reshape(-1,1), data['Close'].values.reshape(-1,1))
    trend = model.coef_[0]
    return trend

# Adjust trading algorithm based on trend
def adjust_trading_algo(trend):
    if trend > 0:
        action = "Buy"
    else:
        action = "Sell"
    return action

# Main function to download data, calculate trend and adjust trading algorithm
def main():
    stock = 'AAPL'
    start_date = '2020-01-01'
    end_date = '2021-12-31'
    data = download_data(stock, start_date, end_date)
    trend = calculate_trend(data)
    action = adjust_trading_algo(trend)
    print(f"The current trend for {stock} is {trend}. Based on this, the action is to {action}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script downloads historical data for a given stock symbol, calculates the trend of the closing prices using a simple linear regression, and then adjusts the trading algorithm to either buy or sell based on the trend. If the trend is positive, the algorithm decides to buy, and if the trend is negative, it decides to sell.

Please note that this is a very simplistic trading algorithm and should not be used for actual trading. Real-world trading algorithms take into account many other factors and use much more complex models to predict market trends.
