To conduct a thorough market analysis, we would need access to a real-time market data feed, which is usually provided by a broker or a financial data provider. Here is a simple example of how you might use Python to analyze market data using pandas, a popular data analysis library. 

In this example, we will use the yfinance library to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)
```

This will print out a DataFrame with the open, high, low, close, volume, dividends, and stock splits for each trading day between the start and end dates.

You can then use pandas' built-in functions to analyze this data. For example, you might want to calculate the moving average:

```python
# Calculate the 20 day moving average
tickerDf['MA20'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the 200 day moving average
tickerDf['MA200'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

print(tickerDf)
```

This is a very basic example of market analysis. In reality, you would likely want to use more sophisticated techniques and consider more factors, such as the performance of the overall market, the company's financials, and macroeconomic indicators. 

Please note that trading involves risk and the above code is for educational purposes only. It should not be used for making real trading decisions without proper understanding of how to interpret the data.
