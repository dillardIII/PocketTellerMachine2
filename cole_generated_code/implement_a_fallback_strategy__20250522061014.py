Sure, here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this example, I'm assuming that the backtest function returns None if no results are found.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest function
    # It should return the backtest results if they exist, otherwise None
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your fallback strategy
    # It should be implemented here
    pass

def run_backtest(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
        results = fallback_strategy()
    return results
```

In this code, `run_backtest` function is used to run the backtest. If the `backtest` function returns `None` (indicating that no results were found), it runs the `fallback_strategy` function instead. You would need to replace the `pass` statements with your actual backtest and fallback strategy implementations.
