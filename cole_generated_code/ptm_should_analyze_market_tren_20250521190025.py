This is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of both financial markets and programming. Here's a simple example of how you might start to approach this using Python. This script will fetch historical price data for a specific stock, calculate its moving averages, and then identify potential trading opportunities based on these averages.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms are much more complex, taking into account many more factors and using advanced statistical techniques.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol 
def download_data(stock):
    data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(stock, start="2020-01-01", end="2021-12-31")
    return data

# Calculate moving averages
def calculate_moving_averages(data, short_window, long_window):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Short moving average
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Long moving average
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                                > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Identify potential trading opportunities
def identify_trading_opportunities(signals):
    buys = signals.loc[signals.positions == 1.0]
    sells = signals.loc[signals.positions == -1.0]
    
    return buys, sells

# Fetch the data
data = download_data('AAPL')

# Calculate moving averages and generate signals
signals = calculate_moving_averages(data, 50, 200)

# Identify potential trades
buys, sells = identify_trading_opportunities(signals)

print("Potential Buys:")
print(buys)
print("Potential Sells:")
print(sells)
```

This script uses the `yfinance` library to download historical price data for a specific stock, and the `pandas` library to analyze this data. It calculates two moving averages for the stock price: a short-term average based on the last 50 days, and a long-term average based on the last 200 days. When the short-term average crosses above the long-term average, this is seen as a potential buying opportunity. When the short-term average crosses below the long-term average, this is seen as a potential selling opportunity.
