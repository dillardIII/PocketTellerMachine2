Sure, I can provide you with a simple Python script that initiates a trade using a fictional trading API. But please note that this is a pseudocode. You'll need to replace it with valid API calls to initiate a trade for a real-world trading system. Besides, the actual trading should always be performed with proper analysis and considerations.

```python
import requests

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_url = 'https://fictional-trading-api.com'  # Replace with real API base URL

    def initiate_trade(self, stock_symbol, quantity):
        trade_url = f'{self.base_url}/trade'
        # Prepare the data
        data = {
            'symbol': stock_symbol,
            'quantity': quantity,
            'action': 'buy'  # Let's assume PTM is initiating a 'buy' action
        }
        try:
            # Initiate trade
            response = requests.post(trade_url, data=data)
            if response.status_code == 200:
                print(f'Successfully initiated trade for {quantity} stocks of {stock_symbol}')
            else:
                print('Failed to initiate trade. Please check the API and try again.')
        except Exception as e:
            print(f'An error occurred while attempting to initiate trade: {str(e)}')

# Start Trading
ptm = PTM()
ptm.initiate_trade('AAPL', 10)  # Buy 10 stocks of Apple
```
In the above script, a class `PTM` is created with a method `initiate_trade` that takes in `stock_symbol` and `quantity` as inputs. This method makes a POST request to the `trade_url` with the trade details. If the request is successful, it prints a success message, else it prints an error message. 

Password, API keys or other sensitive details (usually required for real world trading APIs) are not used in this approach. Those should be handled securely in a real implementation.
