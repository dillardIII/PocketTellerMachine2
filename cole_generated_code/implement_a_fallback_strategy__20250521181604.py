Sure, I'll write a Python function to implement a fallback strategy. However, please keep in mind that without knowing the exact specifics of your trading system and backtest results, this example may not fully meet your needs. You may need to adjust it to fit your particular context.

Here is a basic example:

```python
def backtest_strategy():
    # Run backtest or retrieve backtest results...
    backtest_results = None  # Replace this with your actual logic...
    
    if backtest_results is not None:
        return backtest_results
    else:
        print("No backtest results found! Fallback strategy engaged.")
        # Your fallback strategy should go here...
        fallback_results = None  # Replace this with your actual logic...
        return fallback_results


backtest_strategy()
```

This function attempts to retrieve backtest results. If it finds any, it will return them. If not, it prints a message and then runs a fallback strategy, returning the results of that instead.

Please adjust this code to fit your actual backtest setup and fallback strategy logic.
