To conduct market research, we need to analyze the data from the market. Here is a simple example of how you can do it using Python. In this example, we'll use pandas and yfinance libraries to fetch and analyze stock market data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def get_data(tickers, start_date, end_date):
    data = yf.download(tickers, start=start_date, end=end_date)
    return data

def analyze_data(data):
    # Calculate daily returns
    data['Daily Return'] = data['Adj Close'].pct_change()
    
    # Identify potential trading opportunities where daily return is greater than 2%
    potential_trades = data[data['Daily Return'] > 0.02]
    
    return potential_trades

# Define the tickers of the stocks you are interested in
tickers = ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT']

# Define the start and end dates for the data
start_date = '2020-01-01'
end_date = '2021-12-31'

# Fetch the data
data = get_data(tickers, start_date, end_date)

# Analyze the data to identify potential trading opportunities
potential_trades = analyze_data(data)

print(potential_trades)
```

This script fetches the historical data for the specified tickers within the specified date range. Then it calculates the daily returns and identifies the days where the daily return was greater than 2%. These days might represent potential trading opportunities.

Please note that this is a very simplistic approach and real market research should involve much more complex analysis. Also, this script assumes that you have the yfinance and pandas libraries installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install them using pip:

```python
pip install yfinance pandas
```

Also, please replace 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT' with the tickers of the stocks you are interested in and adjust the start_date and end_date according to your needs.
