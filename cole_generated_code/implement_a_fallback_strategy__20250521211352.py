Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found:

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    try:
        # Assume run_backtest is a function that runs a backtest for a given strategy
        results = run_backtest(strategy)
        
        # If no results are found, raise an exception
        if not results:
            raise ValueError("No backtest results found")
            
        return results
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
        # Fallback strategy
        print("Running fallback strategy...")
        fallback_results = run_backtest("Fallback Strategy")
        return fallback_results
```

In this code, we first try to run the backtest for the given strategy. If no results are found (i.e., `results` is empty), we raise a `ValueError`. In the `except` block, we catch this exception, print an error message, and then run the fallback strategy. The results of the fallback strategy are then returned.

Please note that the function `run_backtest` is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code. You would need to replace it with your actual function to run the backtest.
