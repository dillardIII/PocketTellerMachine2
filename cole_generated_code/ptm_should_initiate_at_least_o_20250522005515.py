Here's a basic example of how you might initiate a trade using Python. This example uses the Alpaca Trade API, which is a popular choice for algorithmic trading. 

Please note that you'll need to replace `'APCA-API-KEY-ID'` and `'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY'` with your actual API keys from Alpaca. Also, this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms can get quite complex.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Setup
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)

# Get daily price data for AAPL over the last 5 trading days.
barset = api.get_barset('AAPL', 'day', limit=5)
aapl_bars = barset['AAPL']

# See how much AAPL moved in that timeframe.
week_open = aapl_bars[0].o
week_close = aapl_bars[-1].c
percent_change = (week_close - week_open) / week_open * 100
print('AAPL moved {}% over the last 5 days'.format(percent_change))
```

In this example, we're initiating a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock. We're then gathering data on the market performance of that stock over the last 5 trading days. The `percent_change` variable tells us how much the price of the stock moved over that timeframe.
