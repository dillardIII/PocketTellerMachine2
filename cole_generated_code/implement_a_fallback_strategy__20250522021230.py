Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs your backtest and returns a result, and a function `fallback_strategy()` that you want to run if no backtest results are found.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    # This should return a result if the backtest is successful
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your fallback strategy here
    # This should also return a result
    pass

def main():
    backtest_result = run_backtest()

    if backtest_result is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")
        fallback_result = fallback_strategy()

        if fallback_result is None:
            print("Fallback strategy also failed. Please check your code.")
        else:
            print("Fallback strategy succeeded.")
            # Do something with fallback_result
    else:
        print("Backtest succeeded.")
        # Do something with backtest_result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This is a very basic example. Depending on your needs, you might want to add more complex error handling, logging, etc.
