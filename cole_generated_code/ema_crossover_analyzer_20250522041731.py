To complete the task, we need to define what EMA Crossover is. EMA stands for Exponential Moving Average, a type of moving average that gives more weight to recent data. A crossover happens when a faster EMA (short-term) crosses a slower EMA (long-term). This is often used as a signal for trend reversals in trading.

Here is a simple Python code using pandas library to analyze EMA crossovers:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def ema_crossover_analyzer(stock_symbol, short_window, long_window):
    # Download historical data as dataframe
    data = yf.download(stock_symbol, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

    # Calculate short and long EMA
    data['short_EMA'] = calculate_ema(data['Close'], short_window)
    data['long_EMA'] = calculate_ema(data['Close'], long_window)

    # Create signals
    data['signal'] = 0.0
    data['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(data['short_EMA'][short_window:] > data['long_EMA'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

    # Generate trading orders
    data['positions'] = data['signal'].diff()

    # Print data
    print(data)

# Test the function
ema_crossover_analyzer('AAPL', 12, 26)
```

This code will download historical data for the specified stock symbol (in this case, 'AAPL' for Apple Inc.), calculate short and long EMA, generate signals when the short EMA crosses the long EMA, and print the data.

Please note that you need to have `yfinance` and `pandas` installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas
```

Also, this is a very basic implementation. In a real-world scenario, you might want to consider transaction costs, slippage, and other factors.
