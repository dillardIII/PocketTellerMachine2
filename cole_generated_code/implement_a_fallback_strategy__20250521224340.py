Sure, here's a Python function that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this example, the fallback strategy is to return a message saying no backtest results were found and to try again later.

```python
def backtest_strategy(data):
    # Assume `run_backtest` is a function that runs backtest on the data
    # and returns results or None if no results found.
    results = run_backtest(data)

    if results is None:
        # Fallback strategy: return a message and try again later.
        return {
            'status': 'error',
            'message': 'No backtest results were found. Please try again later.'
        }

    # If results were found, return them.
    return {
        'status': 'success',
        'results': results
    }
```

You would need to replace `run_backtest` with the actual function that performs the backtest. This function should return `None` or some equivalent value when no results are found.

Please note that the actual implementation of the fallback strategy would depend on the specific requirements of your application. The above code is a basic example and might need to be adjusted to fit your needs.
