Sure, I can help you write a simple Python code to initiate a trade. However, please note that the success of the trade depends on various factors like market conditions, trading strategy, etc. Here's a simple example of how you might initiate a trade using a hypothetical trading API:

```python
import random
from hypothetical_trading_api import initiate_trade

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []

    def initiate_trade(self):
        # Define trade parameters
        # Here we randomly choose between buying and selling for simplicity
        trade_type = random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])
        # Let's say we're trading in a hypothetical stock, and we randomly decide the amount
        stock = 'HYPOTHETICAL_STOCK'
        amount = random.randint(1, 100)

        # Initiate the trade
        trade_id = initiate_trade(trade_type, stock, amount)

        # Store the trade details
        self.trades.append({
            'trade_id': trade_id,
            'trade_type': trade_type,
            'stock': stock,
            'amount': amount,
        })

        print(f"Initiated a {trade_type} trade for {amount} of {stock}")

# Create a PTM instance and initiate a trade
ptm = PTM()
ptm.initiate_trade()
```

This is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider many other factors like current stock price, your trading strategy, etc. Also, the actual implementation would depend on the specific trading API you're using.
