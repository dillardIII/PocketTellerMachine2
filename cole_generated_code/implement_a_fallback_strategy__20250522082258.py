Here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. The fallback strategy could be anything as per your requirement. In this example, I'm simply printing a message and returning an empty dictionary.

```python
def get_backtest_results(backtest_id):
    # Assuming get_results is a function that fetches backtest results
    # based on a given backtest_id
    results = get_results(backtest_id)

    # Check if results are empty
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Applying fallback strategy.")
        # Apply fallback strategy here
        # In this case, fallback strategy is to return an empty dictionary
        return {}
    else:
        return results
```

Please replace the `get_results` function with your actual function to fetch the backtest results. The fallback strategy can be modified as per your needs. For example, you might want to run a default backtest, fetch results from a previous backtest, or notify the user about the issue.
