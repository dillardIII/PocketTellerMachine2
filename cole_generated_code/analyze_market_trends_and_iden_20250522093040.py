To analyze market trends and identify potential profitable trades, we would need historical market data. Python provides several libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and yfinance to analyze and visualize this data. Here's a simple example of how you could use these libraries to analyze the closing prices of a stock (e.g., Apple Inc.) and identify potential profitable trades.

Please note that this is a very basic example and actual trading algorithms can be very complex, involving Machine Learning and other advanced techniques.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol (Apple Inc. in this case)
ticker = 'AAPL'
tickerData = yf.Ticker(ticker)
df = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2020-1-1', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate the moving average
df['MA_10'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
df['MA_20'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Create a new column 'Shares', if MA10>MA20, denote as 1 (buy), otherwise, denote as 0 (sell)
df['Shares'] = [1 if df.loc[ei, 'MA_10']>df.loc[ei, 'MA_20'] else 0 for ei in df.index]

# Add a new column 'Profit' using List Comprehension, for any rows in df, if Shares=1, the profit is calculated as the close price of 
# tomorrow - the close price of today. Otherwise, the profit is 0.
df['Close1'] = df['Close'].shift(-1)
df['Profit'] = [df.loc[ei, 'Close1'] - df.loc[ei, 'Close'] if df.loc[ei, 'Shares']==1 else 0 for ei in df.index]

# Use the cumsum function to calculate the accumulated wealth over the period
df['wealth'] = df['Profit'].cumsum()

# Plot the wealth to show the growth of profit over the period
df['wealth'].plot()
plt.title('Total money you win is {}'.format(df.loc[df.index[-2], 'wealth']))
plt.show()
```

This script downloads the historical data for Apple Inc. from Yahoo Finance, calculates the moving average of the closing prices, and uses this to decide when to buy and sell the stock. The profit from these trades is then calculated and plotted.

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and is not guaranteed to be profitable. It does not take into account trading fees or taxes, and it assumes that you can buy and sell the stock at the closing price, which may not always be possible. Always do your own research before making trading decisions.
