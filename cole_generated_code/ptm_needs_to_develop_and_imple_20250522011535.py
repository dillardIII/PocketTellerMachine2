In order to develop and implement a variety of trading strategies, we need to have a clear understanding of the financial market and the data we are dealing with. Here's a simple Python code that uses the pandas library to handle financial data and implement simple trading strategies.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

# Define the stocks to be used in the portfolio
stocks = ['AAPL', 'GOOG', 'MSFT', 'AMZN']

# Define the weights for the stocks
weights = np.array([0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25])

# Get the stock data
stock_data = pd.DataFrame()
for stock in stocks:
    stock_data[stock] = web.DataReader(stock, data_source='yahoo', start='01-01-2010')['Adj Close']

# Calculate the returns
returns = stock_data.pct_change()

# Calculate the portfolio return
portfolio_return = np.dot(returns, weights)

# Implement a simple trading strategy: buy if the stock goes up, sell if it goes down
stock_data['Buy_Sell_Signal'] = np.where(stock_data['Adj Close'] > stock_data['Adj Close'].shift(1), 'Buy', 'Sell')

# Print the trading strategy
print(stock_data)
```

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and in real life, trading strategies are much more complex and involve a lot more factors. Also, the code assumes that the weights of the stocks in the portfolio are equal, which may not be the case in a real portfolio. 

This code also doesn't take into account transaction costs, taxes, or other factors that could affect the profitability of a trading strategy. It's always a good idea to backtest a trading strategy with historical data before implementing it in a live trading environment.
