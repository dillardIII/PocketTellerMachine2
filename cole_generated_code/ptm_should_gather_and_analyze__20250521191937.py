To gather and analyze market data, we can use the `pandas` library for data manipulation and analysis, and `yfinance` library to download stock market data from Yahoo Finance. Here is a simple example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'GOOGL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-1-25')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Analyze data
# Calculate moving average
tickerDf['MA_50'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(50).mean()
tickerDf['MA_200'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(200).mean()

# If MA_50 > MA_200, it could be a good signal to buy
tickerDf['Buy_Signal'] = tickerDf['MA_50'] > tickerDf['MA_200']

print(tickerDf)
```

This code gathers historical market data for Google (GOOGL) from 2010 to 2020. It then calculates the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which are common technical indicators used to determine the overall trend of the stock. If the 50-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average, it could be a good signal to buy.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading decisions should be based on more complex analysis and strategies. Also, this code doesn't make any trading decisions, it just analyzes the data and provides signals.
