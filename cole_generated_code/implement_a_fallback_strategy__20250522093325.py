Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, the fallback strategy is to simply print a message and return an empty dictionary. 

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # Simulate backtest results
    results = {"profit": 100, "loss": 50}  # Normally this would be calculated

    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Falling back to default strategy.")
        # Fallback strategy
        results = {"profit": 0, "loss": 0}

    return results

def main():
    strategy = "MyStrategy"
    results = backtest(strategy)

    print(f"Backtest results for {strategy}: {results}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example, the `backtest` function simulates a backtest of a trading strategy. If the `results` dictionary is empty (which would indicate that no backtest results were found), the function prints a message and falls back to a default strategy, which in this case is represented by a dictionary with "profit" and "loss" both set to 0.

You can replace the fallback strategy with whatever is appropriate for your specific use case.
