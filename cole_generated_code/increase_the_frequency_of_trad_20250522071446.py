To increase the frequency of trades, we need to modify the trading algorithm. However, without knowing the specifics of the existing trading algorithm, it's difficult to provide a specific Python code. 

Here's a simple hypothetical example of how you might increase the frequency of trades in a basic trading bot:

```python
import time
import random

class TradingBot:
    def __init__(self, trading_frequency):
        self.trading_frequency = trading_frequency  # trades per hour

    def trade(self):
        # This method should contain the logic of making a trade
        # For example, it might analyze market data and decide to buy or sell based on that data
        print("Trade executed")

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.trade()
            time.sleep(60*60 / self.trading_frequency)  # pause for the appropriate amount of time

# Increase trading frequency from 10 trades per hour to 20 trades per hour
bot = TradingBot(20)
bot.run()
```

This code defines a simple trading bot that makes a certain number of trades per hour. The `trade` method, which is currently just a placeholder, should contain the logic for making a trade. The `run` method executes a trade and then pauses for the appropriate amount of time based on the desired trading frequency.

Please note that this is a very simplified example. A real trading bot would need to interface with a trading platform, handle errors and exceptions, manage a portfolio, and much more. Also, increasing the frequency of trades may lead to higher transaction costs, which could eat into profits. Therefore, the decision to increase trading frequency should be made carefully.
