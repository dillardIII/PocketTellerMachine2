To analyze market trends and patterns, we can use Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computation, matplotlib for visualization, and sklearn for machine learning. 

Here is a simple example of how you might use these libraries to analyze stock price data and identify potential profitable trades. This example uses a simple moving average strategy, which is a common technique in stock market analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf

yf.pdr_override()

# Fetch the data
start_date = '2010-01-01'
end_date = '2020-12-31'
df = pdr.get_data_yahoo('AAPL', start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Calculate the 50 days and 200 days moving averages
df['50_SMA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
df['200_SMA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Create a 'Signal' column where if 50-day SMA is greater than 200-day SMA then set Signal as 1 else 0
df['Signal'] = 0.0  
df['Signal'][df['50_SMA'] > df['200_SMA']] = 1.0

# Create a 'Position' column which is the difference of the present and previous day's 'Signal' column
df['Position'] = df['Signal'].diff()

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
plt.plot(df['Close'], label='Close Price', color='blue')
plt.plot(df['50_SMA'], label='50 Day SMA', color='red')
plt.plot(df['200_SMA'], label='200 Day SMA', color='green')
plt.plot(df[df['Position'] == 1].index, df['50_SMA'][df['Position'] == 1], '^', markersize=10, color='m')
plt.plot(df[df['Position'] == -1].index, df['50_SMA'][df['Position'] == -1], 'v', markersize=10, color='k')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.title('AAPL')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

In this code, we first fetch the historical stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance. We then calculate the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) of the closing prices. 

We create a 'Signal' column where we set the value as 1 if the 50-day SMA is greater than the 200-day SMA and 0 otherwise. This is based on the common trading strategy that if the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA, it could be a good time to buy the stock, and vice versa.

We then create a 'Position' column which is the difference of the present and previous day's 'Signal' column. This will help us identify the points where the 50-day SMA crosses the 200-day SMA.

Finally, we plot the closing prices, the 50-day SMA, the 200-day SMA, and the points where the SMA crosses occur. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading strategies are much more complex and take many more factors into account.
