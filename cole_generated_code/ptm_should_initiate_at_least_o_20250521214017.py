Here is a simple Python code that simulates a trading bot. This bot will initiate at least one trade, which can be used to gain experience and potentially increase wins.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, balance=1000):
        self.balance = balance
        self.experience = 0
        self.wins = 0

    def trade(self, amount):
        # simulate a trade
        win = random.choice([True, False])
        if win:
            self.balance += amount
            self.wins += 1
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
        self.experience += 1
        return win

# create a PTM
ptm = PTM()

# initiate at least one trade
amount = 100  # amount to trade
win = ptm.trade(amount)

if win:
    print(f"Trade won! New balance: {ptm.balance}")
else:
    print(f"Trade lost. New balance: {ptm.balance}")

print(f"Experience: {ptm.experience}, Wins: {ptm.wins}")
```

This code creates a PTM (Python Trading Machine) with a starting balance of 1000. The `trade` method simulates a trade by randomly deciding whether the trade is a win or a loss. If the trade is a win, the balance increases by the trade amount and the number of wins increases by 1. If the trade is a loss, the balance decreases by the trade amount. In either case, the experience increases by 1.

After creating the PTM, the code initiates a trade with an amount of 100. It then prints whether the trade was a win or a loss, the new balance, and the current experience and number of wins.
