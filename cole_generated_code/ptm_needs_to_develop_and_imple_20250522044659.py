Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code that uses a simple moving average crossover strategy. This strategy is often used in trading where you buy an asset when the short term moving average crosses above the long term moving average, and sell when the short term moving average crosses below the long term moving average.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and may not necessarily lead to increased wins. Real world trading involves many more factors and complex algorithms.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas_datareader import data as web

# Define the assets to be used
assets = ['AAPL']

# Define the data frame
df = pd.DataFrame()

# Fetch the data
for asset in assets:
    df[asset] = web.DataReader(asset, data_source='yahoo', start='01-01-2010')['Adj Close']

# Calculate the short term simple moving average
short_sma = df.rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long term simple moving average
long_sma = df.rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create a column for "Buy Signal" and "Sell Signal"
df['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(short_sma > long_sma, 1, 0)
df['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(short_sma < long_sma, -1, 0)

# Execute the trading strategy
df['Trade'] = df['Buy_Signal'] + df['Sell_Signal']

# Plot the asset price, short term SMA, and long term SMA
plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
plt.title('Asset Price with Buy & Sell Signals')
plt.plot(df['AAPL'], label='Asset Price', color='blue')
plt.plot(short_sma, label='Short-term SMA', color='red')
plt.plot(long_sma, label='Long-term SMA', color='green')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```

This code fetches historical price data for a specific asset (in this case, Apple Inc. stock), calculates the short term and long term simple moving averages, generates buy and sell signals based on the crossover strategy, executes the trades, and plots the asset price along with the moving averages and trade signals.

Please note that you need to install `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas_datareader` libraries to run this code. Also, this is a very basic strategy and may not necessarily lead to increased wins. Real world trading involves many more factors and complex algorithms.
