Sure, here's a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic trading strategy. This strategy is based on moving averages, a common indicator used in technical analysis. 

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and should not be used for actual trading without further refinement and testing. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-1-25')

# Calculate the short-term simple moving average
tickerDf['SMA_20'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-term simple moving average
tickerDf['SMA_50'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a column to hold the trading signals
tickerDf['Signal'] = 0.0

# Generate trading signals based on the crossover of the short-term and long-term moving averages
tickerDf['Signal'][20:] = np.where(tickerDf['SMA_20'][20:] > tickerDf['SMA_50'][20:], 1.0, 0.0)

# Create a column to hold the trading positions
tickerDf['Position'] = tickerDf['Signal'].diff()

# Print the DataFrame
print(tickerDf)
```

In this code:

- We first download the historical price data for a specific ticker symbol (in this case, Apple Inc. or 'AAPL') using the yfinance library.
- We then calculate the 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages (SMA) of the closing prices.
- We generate trading signals based on the crossover of the two moving averages: we go long (buy) when the short-term average crosses above the long-term average, and we go short (sell) when the short-term average crosses below the long-term average.
- We store the trading signals and positions in separate columns in the DataFrame.

This is a simple example of a trend-following strategy. There are many other types of trading strategies, such as mean-reversion, momentum, breakout, etc., and they can be much more complex, involving multiple indicators and conditions.
