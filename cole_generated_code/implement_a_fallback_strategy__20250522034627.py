Here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def get_backtest_results(backtest_id):
    # This is a placeholder for the actual code that retrieves backtest results
    # It should return a dictionary with backtest results or None if no results are found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy.")
    # Implement your fallback strategy here
    return {}

def main():
    backtest_id = "123"  # replace with actual backtest id
    results = get_backtest_results(backtest_id)
    if results is None:
        results = fallback_strategy()
    # Continue processing results
    print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This is a very basic example. In a real-world scenario, the fallback strategy could be more complex, such as running a different backtest, using pre-calculated results, or raising an exception to stop further processing.
