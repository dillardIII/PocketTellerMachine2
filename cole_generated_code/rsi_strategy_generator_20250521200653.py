The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. Here's a simple Python code to generate RSI strategy:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('seaborn')

def calculate_rsi(data, window):
    delta = data.diff()
    up, down = delta.copy(), delta.copy()
    up[up < 0] = 0
    down[down > 0] = 0

    average_gain = up.rolling(window=window).mean()
    average_loss = abs(down.rolling(window=window).mean())

    rs = average_gain / average_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    
    return rsi

def implement_rsi_strategy(data, window=14):
    close = data['Close']
    rsi = calculate_rsi(close, window)
    data['RSI'] = rsi

    buy_signal = (rsi < 30)
    sell_signal = (rsi > 70)

    data['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(buy_signal, 1, 0)
    data['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(sell_signal, 1, 0)
    
    return data

# Download historical data
ticker = 'AAPL'
start_date = datetime(2020, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime.now()
data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Implement RSI strategy
rsi_data = implement_rsi_strategy(data)

# Plot close price and RSI
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2)
fig.suptitle('RSI Strategy')
axs[0].plot(rsi_data['Close'])
axs[1].plot(rsi_data['RSI'])
plt.show()
```

This code downloads historical data for a given ticker symbol using the `yfinance` library, calculates the RSI for a given window of days, generates buy signals when the RSI is below 30 (oversold condition) and sell signals when the RSI is above 70 (overbought condition), and plots the close price and RSI over time.
