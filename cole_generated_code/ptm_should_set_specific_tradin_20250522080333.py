Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a simple Python code that allows you to set trading goals for wins and losses. This code does not perform actual trading but is a simple representation of how you can track your trading goals.

```python
class TradingGoals:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance):
        self.balance = initial_balance
        self.win_goal = 0
        self.loss_goal = 0

    def set_goals(self, win_goal, loss_goal):
        self.win_goal = win_goal
        self.loss_goal = loss_goal

    def trade(self, amount, win):
        if win:
            self.balance += amount
        else:
            self.balance -= amount

        self.check_goals()

    def check_goals(self):
        if self.balance >= self.win_goal:
            print("Win goal reached!")
        elif self.balance <= self.loss_goal:
            print("Loss goal reached!")

# Usage
ptm = TradingGoals(1000)
ptm.set_goals(1500, 500)

# Simulate some trades
ptm.trade(200, True)  # Win
ptm.trade(300, False) # Loss
ptm.trade(500, True)  # Win
```

In this code, we're creating a `TradingGoals` class that has methods to set trading goals, simulate a trade, and check if the goals have been reached after each trade. Please note that this is a very simplified example and real trading involves more factors and complexity.
