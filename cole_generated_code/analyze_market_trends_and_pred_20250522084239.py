To analyze market trends and predictions, we would typically use a combination of data analysis and machine learning. However, due to the complexity of the task, I'll provide a simplified version of the code using Python's pandas and sklearn libraries.

Please note that this is a simplified version and real-world stock market prediction would require more sophisticated models and data preprocessing. Also, you need to have the historical stock market data in a CSV file.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('stock_market_data.csv')

# We'll predict the 'Close' value
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df.Date,format='%Y-%m-%d')
df.index = df['Date']

# Prepare the data
data = df.sort_index(ascending=True, axis=0)
new_data = pd.DataFrame(index=range(0,len(df)),columns=['Date', 'Close'])

for i in range(0,len(data)):
    new_data['Date'][i] = data['Date'][i]
    new_data['Close'][i] = data['Close'][i]

# Split into train and validation
train = new_data[:987]
valid = new_data[987:]

x_train = train.drop('Close', axis=1)
y_train = train['Close']
x_valid = valid.drop('Close', axis=1)
y_valid = valid['Close']

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
preds = model.predict(x_valid)

# Measure accuracy
rms = np.sqrt(np.mean(np.power((np.array(y_valid)-np.array(preds)),2)))
print('\n RMSE value:', rms)
```

This script loads the data, prepares it for the model, splits it into a training set and a validation set, trains a linear regression model, makes predictions for the next day, and finally measures the accuracy of these predictions using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric.

Please replace 'stock_market_data.csv' with your actual file path and make sure the file is in the correct format.
