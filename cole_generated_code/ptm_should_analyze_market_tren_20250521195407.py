Creating a Python code that analyzes market trends and adjusts trading approaches is a complex task. It involves the use of machine learning and data analysis libraries. Here's a simplified example of how you might start building such a system using pandas for data analysis and sklearn for machine learning:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load market data
# This assumes you have a CSV file "market_data.csv" with 'Date' and 'Price' columns
market_data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Convert 'Date' column to datetime
market_data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(market_data['Date'])

# Sort data by date
market_data = market_data.sort_values('Date')

# Calculate the change in price from the previous day
market_data['Price_Change'] = market_data['Price'].diff()

# Drop the first row which does not have a price change
market_data = market_data.dropna()

# Define the features (X) and the target (y)
X = market_data['Date'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = market_data['Price_Change']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Now the model can predict price changes based on date
# You can use these predictions to adjust your trading approach
```

This is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex. They take into account many more factors and use more advanced machine learning models. Also, this example assumes that you have historical market data in a CSV file. In a real-world scenario, you would likely get this data from a financial API.
