Analyzing market trends and patterns is a complex task that involves machine learning and data analysis. Here is a simple example of how you might use Python to analyze stock data using pandas and matplotlib. This example uses historical data of a stock to plot its closing price and volume of stocks traded each day.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf

yf.pdr_override()

# Input the stock you're interested in
stock = 'AAPL'

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(stock, start="2020-01-01", end="2021-12-31")

# Plotting the closing prices
data['Close'].plot()
plt.title('Closing price of ' + stock)
plt.show()

# Plotting the volume of stocks traded each day
data['Volume'].plot()
plt.title('Volume of ' + stock)
plt.show()
```

This code will plot the closing price and volume of stocks traded each day for a given stock symbol. However, this is a very basic form of analysis and doesn't take into account many other factors that could influence trading decisions, such as other market trends, news events, etc.

For more advanced analysis, you might want to look into machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow, which can help you build models to predict future prices based on historical data. You might also want to use natural language processing libraries like NLTK or spaCy to analyze news articles or social media posts about the stock, which could also influence its price.

Please note that stock market is very unpredictable and this kind of analysis should be used with caution. Always make sure to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making trading decisions.
