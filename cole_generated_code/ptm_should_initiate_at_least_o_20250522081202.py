Sure, I can provide you with a simple Python code that simulates a trading algorithm. However, please note that this is a simplified version and real trading algorithms are much more complex and require a deep understanding of financial markets.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance
        self.trades = 0

    def trade(self, investment, odds):
        self.trades += 1
        win = random.random() < odds
        if win:
            self.balance += investment
        else:
            self.balance -= investment
        return win

# Initialize PTM with $1000
ptm = PTM(1000)

# PTM makes a trade with $100 investment and 50% win odds
win = ptm.trade(100, 0.5)

if win:
    print(f"Trade won! New balance: ${ptm.balance}")
else:
    print(f"Trade lost. New balance: ${ptm.balance}")
```

In this code, we create a `PTM` class that has a `trade` method. This method simulates a trade by generating a random number and checking if it's less than the provided `odds`. If it is, the trade is a win and the investment is added to the balance. If not, the trade is a loss and the investment is subtracted from the balance.

We then create a `PTM` instance with an initial balance of $1000 and make a trade with a $100 investment and 50% win odds. The result of the trade is printed out.

Please note that this is a very simplified version of a trading algorithm and is meant for illustrative purposes only. Real trading algorithms take into account many more factors and require a deep understanding of financial markets.
