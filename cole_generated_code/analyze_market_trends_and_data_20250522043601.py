Analyzing market trends and data for informed trading decisions involves complex algorithms and machine learning models. However, I can provide a simple example of how to analyze stock data using Python. 

In this example, we will use the `pandas` library for data manipulation and analysis, and `yfinance` to download the stock data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA10'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
data['MA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a function to signal when to buy and sell an asset
def create_signals(data):
    buy_signal = []
    sell_signal = []
    flag = -1

    for i in range(len(data)):
        if data['MA10'][i] > data['MA50'][i]:
            if flag != 1:
                buy_signal.append(data['Close'][i])
                sell_signal.append(np.nan)
                flag = 1
            else:
                buy_signal.append(np.nan)
                sell_signal.append(np.nan)
        elif data['MA10'][i] < data['MA50'][i]:
            if flag != 0:
                sell_signal.append(data['Close'][i])
                buy_signal.append(np.nan)
                flag = 0
            else:
                buy_signal.append(np.nan)
                sell_signal.append(np.nan)
        else:
            buy_signal.append(np.nan)
            sell_signal.append(np.nan)

    return (buy_signal, sell_signal)

# Create buy and sell column
data['Buy_Signal_Price'], data['Sell_Signal_Price'] = create_signals(data)

print(data)
```

This script downloads the historical market data for the Apple stock, calculates the moving averages for the past 10 and 50 days, and generates buy/sell signals based on these averages.

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and doesn't take into account many factors that could influence trading decisions. For a real trading strategy, you would need to consider many more factors and probably use machine learning algorithms.
