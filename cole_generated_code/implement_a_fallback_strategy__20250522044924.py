Sure, here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs a backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, the fallback strategy is executed.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function should run a backtest and return the results
    # For this example, it returns None to simulate no results found
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement your fallback strategy
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")

def main():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found!")

main()
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` is supposed to run a backtest and return the results. If no results are found (i.e., `run_backtest()` returns `None`), the `fallback_strategy()` function is called. You should replace the contents of these functions with your actual backtest code and fallback strategy.
