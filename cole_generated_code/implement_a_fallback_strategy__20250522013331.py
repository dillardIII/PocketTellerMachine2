Sure, I'll write a Python function that simulates a trading backtest and implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy will be a simple print statement, but in a real-world scenario, it could be any action you want to take when no backtest results are found.

```python
def trading_backtest(data):
    # Simulate a trading backtest
    backtest_results = None
    try:
        # This is where you'd put your backtesting logic
        # For example, you might run a simulation over your data
        # and store the results in the `backtest_results` variable
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred during backtesting: {e}")
    
    # Implement fallback strategy if no backtest results are found
    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy...")
        # This is where you'd put your fallback strategy
        # For now, we'll just print a message
        print("Fallback strategy implemented successfully.")
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")

# Simulate some trading data
trading_data = None

# Run the trading backtest
trading_backtest(trading_data)
```

In this code, we first try to run a backtest on the provided trading data. If no results are found (i.e., if `backtest_results` is still `None` after the backtest), we implement a fallback strategy. In this case, the fallback strategy is just a print statement, but it could be anything you want.
