I'm sorry, but your request is a bit vague. Developing trading strategies involves complex algorithms and depends on various factors such as the type of trading (stocks, forex, commodities, etc.), the trading style (day trading, swing trading, etc.), risk tolerance, and more. However, I can provide a simple example of a Python code that uses a simple moving average (SMA) crossover strategy. This strategy is one of the most common systematic trading strategies.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading involves many more factors. Also, this script assumes that you have a dataset named 'data.csv' with 'Date' and 'Close' columns.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Calculate the short-term SMA (e.g., 50 days)
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Calculate the long-term SMA (e.g., 200 days)
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Create a column to hold the trading signals
data['Signal'] = 0.0

# Generate trading signals based on the SMA crossover
data['Signal'][50:] = np.where(data['SMA_50'][50:] > data['SMA_200'][50:], 1.0, 0.0)

# Generate trading orders based on the signals
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Plot the data along with the trading signals and orders
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price', color='blue')
plt.plot(data['SMA_50'], label='50-Day SMA', color='red')
plt.plot(data['SMA_200'], label='200-Day SMA', color='green')
plt.plot(data.loc[data.Position == 1.0].index, data.SMA_50[data.Position == 1.0], '^', markersize=10, color='m')
plt.plot(data.loc[data.Position == -1.0].index, data.SMA_50[data.Position == -1.0], 'v', markersize=10, color='k')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.title('SMA Crossover Trading Strategy')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

This script generates trading signals based on a simple moving average crossover strategy. When the short-term SMA crosses above the long-term SMA, it generates a buy signal (represented by the magenta up-pointing triangles). When the short-term SMA crosses below the long-term SMA, it generates a sell signal (represented by the black down-pointing triangles).
