Analyzing market trends and making informed decisions involves a lot of data analysis and machine learning. Here's a simple example of how you might use Python to analyze stock prices using a linear regression model. This is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv')

# Prepare the data
X = data['High'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = data['Low'].values.reshape(-1,1)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()  
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))  
print('Mean Squared Error:', metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))  
print('Root Mean Squared Error:', np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)))

# If the error is small, the model is good and can be used to make trading decisions
```

This code loads some stock data, prepares it, splits it into a training set and a testing set, trains a linear regression model on the training data, makes predictions with the testing data, and then evaluates the model by calculating the mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex. They would take into account many more factors, use more complex models, and also include risk management strategies.
