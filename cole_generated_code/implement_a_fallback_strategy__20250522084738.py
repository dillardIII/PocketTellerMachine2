Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def get_backtest_results(backtest_id):
    # This is a placeholder for the actual code that retrieves backtest results
    # Let's assume it returns a dictionary with backtest results or None if no results are found
    results = get_backtest_results_from_database(backtest_id)

    # Fallback strategy
    if results is None:
        print(f"No backtest results found for id: {backtest_id}")
        return {}

    return results

def get_backtest_results_from_database(backtest_id):
    # Placeholder for the actual code that retrieves backtest results from the database
    pass
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results_from_database` is a placeholder for the actual function that retrieves backtest results from the database. If this function returns `None`, it means that no backtest results were found for the given id. In this case, the fallback strategy is activated: a message is printed to the console and an empty dictionary is returned.

Please replace `get_backtest_results_from_database` with your actual function to retrieve backtest results. Also, you may want to modify the fallback strategy to better suit your needs. For example, you could return a default set of results, raise an exception, log an error message, etc.
