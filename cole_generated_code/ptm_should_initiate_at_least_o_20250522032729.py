Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates initiating a trade. This code doesn't represent real trading activity. It's just a simulation. For real trading, you'd need to use a trading API and follow the respective legal and ethical guidelines.

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, ticker, volume, trade_type):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.volume = volume
        self.trade_type = trade_type

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []

    def initiate_trade(self, trade):
        self.trades.append(trade)
        print(f"Trade initiated: {trade.trade_type} {trade.volume} of {trade.ticker}")

    def evaluate_strategy(self):
        # Here you should implement your strategy evaluation logic
        print(f"Evaluating strategy based on {len(self.trades)} trades")
        return "Strategy evaluation result"

# Create PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
trade = Trade("AAPL", 100, "BUY")
ptm.initiate_trade(trade)

# Evaluate strategy
print(ptm.evaluate_strategy())
```

In this code, we have two classes: `Trade` and `PTM`. `Trade` represents a single trade and `PTM` represents a trading system. `PTM` has a method `initiate_trade` to initiate a trade and a method `evaluate_strategy` to evaluate the current strategy. The strategy evaluation logic is not implemented, as it would depend on your specific strategy and data.
