Here is a basic Python function that provides a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found:

```python
def backtest_strategy(data):
    # Assuming data is a list of backtest results
    if len(data) == 0:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Here goes the fallback strategy code
        # Just as an example, we're randomly picking an action
        actions = ['Buy', 'Sell', 'Hold']
        import random
        action = random.choice(actions)
        print(f'Fallback action: {action}')
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")
        # Code that processes the backtest results
        # ...
```

In this example, if the `data` variable (which should contain the backtest results) is empty, a message is printed and a random action (Buy, Sell or Hold) is selected as a fallback strategy. 

Remember: This is a simplified version of what you want to implement and may need to be modified based on your actual backtesting and trading strategies.

In an actual scenario, the fallback strategy could consist of more robust strategies such as using another type of analysis, using previous backtest results, or notifying the user about the lack of results to make manual decisions, among others.
