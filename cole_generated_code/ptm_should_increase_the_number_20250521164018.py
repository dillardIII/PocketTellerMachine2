Sure, it's a bit unclear on how exactly Python can be used to increase transactions for a trading context such as PTM. But, ostensibly, you might have a system where you place trades either manually or automatically and you want to increase the frequency of these trades. Here is a simple example of a function that could do this:

```python
class PTM:
    balance = 1000  # initial balance
    current_transactions = 0 # current number of transactions

    def trade(self, amount, win_chance):
        import random
        self.current_transactions += 1
        win = random.random() < win_chance
        if win:
            self.balance += amount
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
        return win

    def increase_transactions(self, increase_by=10, amount=10, win_chance=0.5):
        for _ in range(increase_by):
            x = self.trade(amount, win_chance)
            if x:
                print("Trade #", self.current_transactions, " Win")
            else:
                print("Trade #", self.current_transactions, " Loss")

ptm = PTM()
ptm.increase_transactions(increase_by=10, amount=50, win_chance=0.45)
```

In this simple setup, a PTM class represents the trading model. Its `trade` method performs a trade where there is a `win_chance` chance of winning, and trades result in a direct increase or decrease in balance. The `increase_transactions` method then simply executes a number of trades (specified by `increase_by`) which will improve chances of wins and losses. It prints the trade number along with whether it has been a win or a loss. 

Keep in mind this is a very basic and naive implementation and does not include all the complexities of real world trading. You would need to have a sound strategy and careful risk management to ensure that increasing the number of transactions results in an overall increase in balance. Also remember to take into account transaction costs. To get real trading data or to place real trades, you would likely work with a trading API.
