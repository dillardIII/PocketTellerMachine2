To analyze recent market trends, you'll likely want to use a combination of data gathering, processing, and visualizing. For this, we can use popular libraries in Python, such as pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download historical market data, and matplotlib for data visualization. Here is a simple code snippet that shows a basic way to analyze the market trend of a particular stock, in this case, let's use the Apple Inc stock.

NOTE: This is a very basic example, market trends analyzing includes several complex tasks which is not shown in this example.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data as dataframe
df = yf.download('AAPL', start='2022-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate simple moving average
df['SMA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate exponential moving average
df['EMA'] = df['Close'].ewm(span=20, adjust=False).mean()

# Plot close price, SMA and EMA
plt.figure(figsize=(14,8))
plt.plot(df['Close'], label='Close Price', color='blue')
plt.plot(df['SMA'], label='20 Day SMA', color='red')
plt.plot(df['EMA'], label='20 Day EMA', color='green')
plt.title('Apple Stock Price | 20 Day SMA & 20 Day EMA')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price ($)')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This script first downloads historical data for the Apple Inc. stock from the beginning of the year to the end of year. Then, it calculates a simple and an exponential moving average of the close price over a period of 20 days. These indicators can give insights about market trends. Finally, it plots the close price, the simple moving average, and the exponential moving average.

Please note that real market trend analysis is much more complex, involving other technical indicators, sentiment analysis, and possibly machine learning algorithms.
