Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that simulates a trade initiation. This code doesn't actually perform any real trades, but it gives an idea of how you might structure such a program. 

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, ticker, volume):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.volume = volume

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategies = ['Strategy1', 'Strategy2', 'Strategy3']
        self.tickers = ['AAPL', 'GOOG', 'TSLA', 'AMZN']
        self.trades = []

    def initiate_trade(self):
        # Select a random strategy
        strategy = random.choice(self.strategies)

        # Select a random ticker
        ticker = random.choice(self.tickers)

        # Determine trade volume
        volume = random.randint(1, 100)

        print(f"Initiating trade using {strategy} on {ticker} with volume {volume}")

        # Create a new trade
        trade = Trade(ticker, volume)

        # Add the trade to the list of trades
        self.trades.append(trade)

        return trade

# Create a PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
trade = ptm.initiate_trade()
```

This code creates a PTM (Portfolio Trade Manager) with a list of strategies and tickers. When `initiate_trade` is called, it randomly selects a strategy and a ticker, generates a random volume, and initiates a trade. The trade is then added to the list of trades.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and a real trading system would be much more complex, involving real-time data feeds, risk management, and order execution systems.
