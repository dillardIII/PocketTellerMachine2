Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this example, I'm assuming that the backtest results are stored in a list. If the list is empty (i.e., no backtest results are found), the fallback strategy is executed.

```python
def backtest_strategy():
    # Assuming backtest_results is a list
    backtest_results = []

    if len(backtest_results) == 0:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found. Proceeding with the original strategy...")
        # Continue with the original strategy

def fallback_strategy():
    print("Fallback strategy is now in action...")
    # Implement your fallback strategy here

# Call the backtest_strategy function
backtest_strategy()
```

Please replace the print statements and comments with the actual logic of your original and fallback strategies.
