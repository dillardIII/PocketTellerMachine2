Sure, here is a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the program will print a message and then proceed with a default strategy.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest function
    # It should return the backtest results if they exist
    pass

def default_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your default strategy function
    # It should execute your default strategy
    pass

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    backtest_results = backtest_strategy(strategy)
    
    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing default strategy.")
        default_strategy()
    else:
        # If backtest results exist, execute the strategy
        strategy.execute()

# Example usage:
execute_strategy(my_strategy)
```

In this example, `backtest_strategy()` and `default_strategy()` are placeholders for your actual functions. You would replace these with your actual backtest and default strategy functions.

Please note that the actual implementation might be more complex depending on the details of your trading system, the structure of your strategies, and how you handle backtesting and strategy execution.
