Sure, here is a simple example of a Python code that uses the Alpaca API to initiate a trade. Please note that you need to replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your own Alpaca API key and secret.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Get account information
account = api.get_account()
print(account)

# Check if our account is restricted from trading.
if account.trading_blocked:
    print('Account is currently restricted from trading.')

# Check how much money we have to work with.
print('${} is available as cash'.format(account.cash))

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)

# Get our position in AAPL
aapl_position = api.get_position('AAPL')

print(aapl_position)
```

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock. After the trade, it will print out the position of AAPL in our account.

Please note that this is a very basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would want to analyze market trends and make decisions based on that analysis before initiating a trade.
