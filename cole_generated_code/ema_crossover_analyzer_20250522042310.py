Sure, I can help with that. Here's a basic example of how you could implement an EMA Crossover Analyzer in Python using the `pandas` library. This script will calculate the EMA for two different periods and then determine when the EMAs cross over each other.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = "AAPL"
data = yf.download(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

# Calculate the EMA for two different periods
short_ema = data['Close'].ewm(span=12, adjust=False).mean()
long_ema = data['Close'].ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()

# Create a new DataFrame to store the data
analysis = pd.DataFrame()
analysis['Close'] = data['Close']
analysis['Short_EMA'] = short_ema
analysis['Long_EMA'] = long_ema

# Create a column for the signal
analysis['Signal'] = 0.0
analysis['Signal'][short_ema > long_ema] = 1.0
analysis['Signal'][short_ema < long_ema] = -1.0

# Create a column for positions
analysis['Position'] = analysis['Signal'].diff()

print(analysis)
```

This script will print out a DataFrame with the closing price, the short EMA, the long EMA, the current signal (1.0 for a long position, -1.0 for a short position), and the position (1.0 for a buy, -1.0 for a sell).

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and might need to be adjusted based on your specific needs. Also, you need to install `yfinance` and `pandas` libraries. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas
```
