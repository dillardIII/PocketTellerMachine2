To conduct market research, we can use Python libraries like pandas, yfinance, and matplotlib. Here's a simple example of how you might use these libraries to analyze stock data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'  # Apple Inc.

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# Plot the close prices
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(tickerDf['Close'])
plt.title('Historical Close Price of ' + tickerSymbol)
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Close Price (USD)')
plt.show()
```

This code will plot the historical closing prices of Apple Inc.'s stock from 2010 to 2020. You can replace 'AAPL' with the ticker symbol of any company you're interested in.

Please note that this is a very basic example of market research. Real market research would involve much more complex analysis and might take into account many other factors.

Also, please remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. Always do your own research before making any trading decisions.
