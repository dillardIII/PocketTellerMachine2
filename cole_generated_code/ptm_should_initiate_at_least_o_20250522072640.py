Sure, here is a simple Python code to initiate a trade. Please note that this is a very basic example and in a real-world scenario, you would need to use a trading API to place trades and also consider various factors like market conditions, trading fees, etc.

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, strategy):
        self.strategy = strategy

    def initiate_trade(self):
        # Assuming the strategy returns a tuple with (action, amount)
        action, amount = self.strategy()
        if action == "Buy":
            print(f"Buying {amount} shares")
        elif action == "Sell":
            print(f"Selling {amount} shares")

# Define a simple strategy
def simple_strategy():
    # This is a very simple strategy that always buys 10 shares
    return ("Buy", 10)

# Initialize a trade with the simple strategy
trade = Trade(simple_strategy)

# Initiate the trade
trade.initiate_trade()
```

In this code, we define a `Trade` class that takes a trading strategy as an argument. The `initiate_trade` method of this class uses the strategy to decide whether to buy or sell shares. We also define a `simple_strategy` function that always returns a tuple with the action "Buy" and the amount 10. We then create a `Trade` object with this strategy and initiate the trade.

Please replace the `simple_strategy` function with your actual trading strategy.
