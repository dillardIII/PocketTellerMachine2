Sure, I can help you with that. But please note that creating a trading strategy is a complex task and requires a deep understanding of financial markets. Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic moving average crossover strategy. This strategy buys when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, and sells when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2021-12-31')

# Calculate short-term and long-term moving averages
short_ma = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
long_ma = data['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create signals based on crossover
data['Buy_Signal'] = (short_ma > long_ma)
data['Sell_Signal'] = (short_ma < long_ma)

# Plot data
plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label=ticker)
plt.plot(short_ma, label='Short-term MA')
plt.plot(long_ma, label='Long-term MA')
plt.plot(data.loc[data['Buy_Signal'], 'Close'], '^', markersize=10, color='g', label='buy')
plt.plot(data.loc[data['Sell_Signal'], 'Close'], 'v', markersize=10, color='r', label='sell')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.title('Moving Average Crossover Strategy')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

This code uses the `yfinance` library to download historical data for a specific ticker symbol. It then calculates short-term and long-term moving averages of the closing prices. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it generates a buy signal. When the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, it generates a sell signal.

Please note that this is a very simple trading strategy and may not be profitable in real trading. It's important to backtest any strategy thoroughly before live trading. Also, this strategy doesn't take into account transaction costs, slippage, or risk management.
