Here is a basic example of python code for EMA Crossover Analyzer using pandas data frame for the calculation.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate short-term exponential moving average (EMA) on the Close price column
short_ema = data['Close'].ewm(span=12, adjust=False).mean()

# Calculate long-term EMA on the Close price column
long_ema = data['Close'].ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()

# Create signals based on the crossover of short and long EMA 
data['Buy_Signal_Flag'] = short_ema > long_ema
data['Sell_Signal_Flag'] = short_ema < long_ema

# Print data
print(data)
```

In this Python script, we are using the yfinance library to download the historical price data for AAPL. We calculate the short-term and long-term EMA based on the closing price of the stock using pandas' ewm function. Span of 12 and 26 are typical spans used for short and long EMA.

We then create a column in the dataframe to flag the Buy and Sell signals based on the EMA crossover. When the short EMA is higher than the long EMA, it signals the potential start of uptrend, and we flag it as a potential buy signal. Similarly, when the short EMA is lower than the long EMA, a downtrend could be starting, and we flag it as a potential sell signal.

Please note that this is a simplified example and additional factors like transaction costs, slippage, etc. have not been considered. Please use this code as a starting point and modify according to your specific need. Professional advice should be taken before making investment decisions.
