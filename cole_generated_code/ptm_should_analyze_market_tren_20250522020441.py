To analyze market trends and opportunities for potential trades, we would need to use a library like pandas for data manipulation and analysis, and yfinance to download stock price data from Yahoo Finance. Here is a basic example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data for this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start=(datetime.now()-timedelta(days=365)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), end=datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))

# Calculate simple moving average
tickerDf['SMA'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate standard deviation
tickerDf['STD'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=20).std()

# Calculate upper and lower Bollinger Bands
tickerDf['Upper_BB'] = tickerDf['SMA'] + (tickerDf['STD'] * 2)
tickerDf['Lower_BB'] = tickerDf['SMA'] - (tickerDf['STD'] * 2)

# Print the last 5 rows of the data
print(tickerDf.tail(5))
```

This script calculates the Bollinger Bands for the stock, which are a type of statistical chart characterizing the prices and volatility over time of a financial instrument or commodity, using a formulaic method propounded by John Bollinger in the 1980s.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms should consider many more factors and use more sophisticated statistical methods. Also, it's important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.
