Sure, here is a simple Python code that uses the `yfinance` library to download data and initiate a trade. For simplicity, we will assume that we are trading Apple stocks.

Please note that this is a simulated trade and does not involve real money. For real trading, you would need to use a trading API (like Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, etc.) and ensure you comply with all legal and regulatory requirements.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol 
def download_data(stock):
    data = yf.download(stock, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")
    return data

# Simulate a trade
def trade(data):
    # Buy at the opening price of the first available day
    buy_price = data.iloc[0]['Open']
    print(f"Bought at: ${buy_price}")

    # Sell at the closing price of the last available day
    sell_price = data.iloc[-1]['Close']
    print(f"Sold at: ${sell_price}")

    # Calculate profit/loss
    profit_loss = sell_price - buy_price
    if profit_loss > 0:
        print(f"Profit: ${profit_loss}")
    else:
        print(f"Loss: ${-profit_loss}")

# Download data for Apple
data = download_data('AAPL')

# Simulate a trade with the downloaded data
trade(data)
```

This code downloads historical data for Apple stocks and simulates a trade where we buy at the opening price of the first available day and sell at the closing price of the last available day. The profit or loss from the trade is then printed.

Remember, this is a very basic example and real trading involves much more complexity including transaction costs, risk management, and regulatory compliance.
