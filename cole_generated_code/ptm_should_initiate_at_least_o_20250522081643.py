Sure, here's a simple Python code to initiate a trade. Please note that this code is a simulation and doesn't actually execute any real trades. It's just a representation of how a trade could be initiated in Python. 

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, ticker, volume):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.volume = volume

    def execute_trade(self):
        print(f"Trade executed: Bought {self.volume} shares of {self.ticker}.")

# Initialize a trade
trade = Trade("PTM", 100)

# Execute the trade
trade.execute_trade()
```

In this code, we define a `Trade` class with a `ticker` and `volume` attributes, representing the stock to be traded and the number of shares to be traded respectively. The `execute_trade` method simulates the execution of the trade.

Please note, to actually execute a trade, you would need to integrate with a trading platform's API, such as E*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, or similar. This would involve authenticating with the API, sending a request to execute a trade, and handling the response. This is a non-trivial task and involves handling real money, so it should be done carefully and securely.
