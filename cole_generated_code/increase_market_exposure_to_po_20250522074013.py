Sure, I can help you with that. However, the task you're asking for is quite broad and can be interpreted in many ways. Here's a simple Python code to increase the number of trades by a certain percentage, which could potentially increase the number of wins. This code assumes that you have a list of trades and you want to increase the number of trades by a certain percentage.

```python
# List of trades
trades = [trade1, trade2, trade3, ...]

# Percentage increase
increase_percentage = 0.2  # 20%

# Calculate the number of additional trades
additional_trades = int(len(trades) * increase_percentage)

# Add the additional trades
for i in range(additional_trades):
    # Here you need to define how you want to add the trades
    # For example, you could duplicate existing trades, or create new ones
    new_trade = create_new_trade()  # You need to define this function
    trades.append(new_trade)
```

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In real-world trading, you would need to consider many other factors, such as market conditions, risk management, etc. Also, increasing the number of trades doesn't necessarily increase the number of wins, it could also increase the number of losses. It's important to have a good trading strategy and not just increase the number of trades blindly.
