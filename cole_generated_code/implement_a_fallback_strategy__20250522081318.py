Sure, I can help with that. However, I need more context about the current implementation to provide a more specific solution. But I can give you a general idea of how you might handle this in Python. Let's say you have a function `run_backtest()` that returns `None` if no backtest results are found. Here's a simple fallback strategy:

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    # Let's assume it returns None if no results are found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your fallback strategy here
    pass

# Run backtest
backtest_results = run_backtest()

# If no backtest results found, run fallback strategy
if backtest_results is None:
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
    fallback_results = fallback_strategy()
    # Now you can do something with fallback_results
else:
    print("Backtest results found.")
    # Now you can do something with backtest_results
```

In this code, if `run_backtest()` returns `None`, the fallback strategy is executed. You would replace `fallback_strategy()` with whatever your fallback strategy is.
