Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade using a hypothetical trading API:

```python
import random
import time

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, symbol, quantity, price):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.price = price

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # Starting balance
        self.trades = []  # List of trades

    def initiate_trade(self, symbol, quantity):
        price = self.get_current_price(symbol)
        if price * quantity > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient balance to initiate the trade.")
            return
        trade = Trade(symbol, quantity, price)
        self.trades.append(trade)
        self.balance -= price * quantity
        print(f"Trade initiated. Bought {quantity} of {symbol} at {price}. Current balance: {self.balance}")

    def get_current_price(self, symbol):
        # In a real-world scenario, here you would use an API to get the current price of the symbol.
        # For simplicity, we'll just return a random price between 10 and 100.
        return random.uniform(10, 100)

# Create a PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
ptm.initiate_trade("AAPL", 10)
```

This code creates a PTM (Portfolio Trading Manager) class that can initiate trades. The `initiate_trade` method creates a `Trade` object and adds it to the list of trades. It also deducts the cost of the trade from the balance. If there is not enough balance to initiate the trade, it prints an error message.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and doesn't take into account many factors that you would need to consider in a real-world trading scenario, such as transaction fees, market hours, different types of orders, etc. Also, in a real-world scenario, you would use a trading API to get the current price of a symbol and to initiate the trade.
