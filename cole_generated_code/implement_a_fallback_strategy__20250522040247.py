Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the fallback strategy is to return a message saying "No backtest results found. Please try again later."

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume get_backtest_results is a function that returns backtest results
    # for a given strategy
    results = get_backtest_results(strategy)

    if not results:
        # Fallback strategy: return a message
        return "No backtest results found. Please try again later."

    return results

# Test the function with a strategy
print(backtest_strategy("Strategy1"))
```

Please note that the implementation of `get_backtest_results` function is not provided here. You would need to replace it with your actual function to fetch backtest results. Also, the fallback strategy can be anything as per your requirements. Here, I have assumed it to be a simple message but it can be a different strategy or any other action as per your needs.
