Here's a simple Python code that implements a basic trading strategy using moving averages. This strategy is not guaranteed to increase potential wins, but it's a good starting point for developing more complex strategies.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Collect data on this ticker
df = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickerSymbol, start="2020-01-01", end="2021-12-31")

# Calculate the short-term exponential moving average (EMA)
ShortEMA = df.Close.ewm(span=12, adjust=False).mean()

# Calculate the long-term exponential moving average (EMA)
LongEMA = df.Close.ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()

# Create a new column in the dataframe to hold the trading strategy signals
df['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(ShortEMA > LongEMA, 1, 0)
df['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(ShortEMA < LongEMA, -1, 0)

# Implement the trading strategy
df['Strategy'] = df['Buy_Signal'] + df['Sell_Signal']

print(df)
```

This script downloads historical data for a specific ticker (in this case, Apple's stock), calculates the short-term and long-term EMAs, and generates trading signals based on these EMAs. When the short-term EMA is above the long-term EMA, the script generates a buy signal, and when the short-term EMA is below the long-term EMA, it generates a sell signal.

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and should not be used for real trading without further improvements and adjustments. It's always recommended to backtest any trading strategy before implementing it.
