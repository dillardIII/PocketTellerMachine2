Here is a simple Python code that simulates a basic trading strategy. This strategy is based on moving averages, a common indicator in technical analysis. The strategy is to buy when the short-term average crosses above the long-term average, and sell when the short-term average crosses below the long-term average.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and may not necessarily increase the number of trades. More advanced strategies would require complex algorithms and possibly machine learning models.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    sma = data.rolling(window=window).mean()
    return sma

def calculate_lma(data, window):
    lma = data.rolling(window=window).mean()
    return lma

def implement_strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    # Calculate short term and long term moving averages
    data['short_mavg'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], short_window)
    data['long_mavg'] = calculate_lma(data['Close'], long_window)

    # Create signals
    data['signal'] = 0.0
    data['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(data['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                            > data['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)

    # Generate trading orders
    data['positions'] = data['signal'].diff()

    return data

# Fetch data
data = web.DataReader('AAPL', 'yahoo', start='01/01/2010', end='01/01/2022')

# Implement the strategy
data = implement_strategy(data, 50, 200)

# Print data
print(data)
```

In this code, we first calculate the short-term and long-term moving averages. Then, we create a signal column where we mark 1.0 if the short-term average is greater than the long-term average and 0.0 otherwise. Finally, we generate trading orders by taking the difference of the signal column. A positive difference indicates a buy order and a negative difference indicates a sell order.
