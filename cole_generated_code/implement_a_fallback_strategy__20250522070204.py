Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the program will print a message and then proceed to execute the fallback strategy.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # This is just a placeholder for your actual backtest logic
    # You would replace this with actual code that performs the backtest
    # and returns the results
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is just a placeholder for your actual fallback strategy
    # You would replace this with actual code that executes the fallback strategy
    print("Executing fallback strategy...")

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    backtest_results = backtest_strategy(strategy)
    
    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Falling back to fallback strategy.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # If backtest results are found, proceed as normal
        print("Backtest results found. Proceeding with strategy execution.")
        # Here you would add code to execute the strategy based on the backtest results

# To use the function, you would call it like this:
execute_strategy(my_strategy)
```

Please replace the `backtest_strategy` and `fallback_strategy` functions with your actual backtest and fallback strategy logic.
