Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def get_backtest_results(backtest_id):
    # This is a placeholder for the code that would normally fetch the backtest results.
    # In a real-world scenario, you would replace this with actual code.
    backtest_results = {}

    if not backtest_results:
        print("No backtest results found for id: ", backtest_id)
        # Fallback strategy: return an empty dictionary
        return {}

    return backtest_results
```

This is a very basic fallback strategy. Depending on your specific requirements, you might want to implement a more sophisticated strategy. For example, you might want to retry the backtest, fetch results from a backup source, or raise an exception.
