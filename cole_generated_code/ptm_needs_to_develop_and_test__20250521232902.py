Sure, I can provide a basic structure of a Python code that simulates a simple trading strategy. However, please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading strategies involve complex algorithms, real-time data processing, and rigorous backtesting.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assuming we have historical stock price data in a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('stock_price_data.csv')

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA10'] = data['price'].rolling(window=10).mean()
data['MA50'] = data['price'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a 'signals' column where 1 means to buy and 0 means to sell
data['signal'] = np.where(data['MA10'] > data['MA50'], 1.0, 0.0)

# Generate trading orders
data['positions'] = data['signal'].diff()

# Print the DataFrame
print(data)

# Backtesting
initial_capital = float(10000.0)

# Create a DataFrame 'positions'
positions = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index).fillna(0.0)

# Buy a 100 shares
positions['stock'] = 100*data['signal']   
  
# Initialize the portfolio with value owned   
portfolio = positions.multiply(data['price'], axis=0)

# Store the difference in shares owned 
pos_diff = positions.diff()

# Add 'holdings' to portfolio
portfolio['holdings'] = (positions.multiply(data['price'], axis=0)).sum(axis=1)

# Add 'cash' to portfolio
portfolio['cash'] = initial_capital - (pos_diff.multiply(data['price'], axis=0)).sum(axis=1).cumsum()   

# Add 'total' to portfolio
portfolio['total'] = portfolio['cash'] + portfolio['holdings']

# Add 'returns' to portfolio
portfolio['returns'] = portfolio['total'].pct_change()

print(portfolio)
```

This code implements a simple moving average crossover strategy, where we buy the stock when the 10-day moving average crosses above the 50-day moving average, and sell when it crosses below. The 'portfolio' DataFrame then calculates the value of the portfolio over time, including cash on hand and the value of the held stocks.
