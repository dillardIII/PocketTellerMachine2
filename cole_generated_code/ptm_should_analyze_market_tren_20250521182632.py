To analyze market trends and opportunities for potential profitable trades, we can use Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download the stock data, matplotlib for data visualization, and sklearn for machine learning. 

Here is a simple Python code to analyze market trends for a particular stock:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL','2016-01-01','2021-12-31')

# Calculate the moving average
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Plot the close price and the moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price')
plt.plot(data['SMA_50'], label='50-day moving average')
plt.plot(data['SMA_200'], label='200-day moving average')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()

# Prepare the data for the model
data['Prediction'] = data['Close'].shift(-1)
X = data[['Close']]
X = X[:-1]
y = data['Prediction']
y = y[:-1]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()  
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Compare predictions with the actual values
df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test, 'Predicted': predictions})
print(df)
```

This code downloads the historical data for Apple Inc. (AAPL), calculates the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and plots them. Then it prepares the data for a simple linear regression model, trains the model, makes predictions, and compares the predictions with the actual values.

Please note that this is a very basic model and might not be very accurate. For a more accurate model, you might need to consider more factors and use more complex models.
