Sure, I can provide a simple example of how to execute a trade using a Python library for interacting with a trading API. For this example, I'll use the Alpaca API, which is a commission-free trading platform that provides a RESTful API for programmatic trading.

Please replace 'APCA-API-KEY-ID' and 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY' with your actual Alpaca account API key and secret key.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Setup
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code will execute a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock at the current market price. The 'gtc' (good-till-canceled) parameter means the order will remain active until it is filled or manually canceled.

Please note that this is a very basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle exceptions, monitor the status of your orders, manage your portfolio, etc. Also, keep in mind that trading involves financial risk, so you should only trade with money you can afford to lose.

Before running this script, you need to install the Alpaca API Python SDK. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Remember to replace 'APCA-API-KEY-ID' and 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY' with your actual Alpaca account API key and secret key.
