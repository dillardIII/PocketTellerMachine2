To analyze market trends and patterns, we can use Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

Here's a simple Python code that uses moving averages to identify potential trading opportunities:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# Fetching the data
df = pdr.get_data_yahoo("AAPL", start="2020-01-01", end="2021-12-31")

# Calculate the short-term exponential moving average (EMA)
ShortEMA = df.Close.ewm(span=12, adjust=False).mean()

# Calculate the long-term exponential moving average (EMA)
LongEMA = df.Close.ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()

# Calculate the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)
MACD = ShortEMA - LongEMA

# Calculate the signal line
signal = MACD.ewm(span=9, adjust=False).mean()

# Create a new column in the dataframe to hold the MACD and the signal data
df['MACD'] = MACD
df['Signal Line'] = signal

# A function to signal when to buy and sell an asset/stock
def buy_sell(signal):
    Buy = []
    Sell = []
    flag = -1

    for i in range(0, len(signal)):
        if signal['MACD'][i] > signal['Signal Line'][i]:
            Sell.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 1:
                Buy.append(signal['Close'][i])
                flag = 1
            else:
                Buy.append(np.nan)
        elif signal['MACD'][i] < signal['Signal Line'][i]:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            if flag != 0:
                Sell.append(signal['Close'][i])
                flag = 0
            else:
                Sell.append(np.nan)
        else:
            Buy.append(np.nan)
            Sell.append(np.nan)

    return (Buy, Sell)

# Create buy and sell column
a = buy_sell(df)
df['Buy_Signal_Price'] = a[0]
df['Sell_Signal_Price'] = a[1]

# Visually show the stock buy and sell signals
plt.figure(figsize=(12.2, 4.5))
plt.scatter(df.index, df['Buy_Signal_Price'], color='green', label='Buy Signal', marker='^', alpha=1)
plt.scatter(df.index, df['Sell_Signal_Price'], color='red', label='Sell Signal', marker='v', alpha=1)
plt.plot(df['Close'], label='Close Price', alpha=0.35)
plt.title('Close Price Buy & Sell Signals')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Close Price USD ($)')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```

This script fetches historical data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, calculates the MACD and signal line, and then generates buy and sell signals based on these two indicators. The buy and sell signals are then plotted on a graph for visual analysis. 

Please note that this is a very basic form of analysis and should not be used for actual trading decisions without further enhancements.
