To analyze market conditions and identify potential trading opportunities, we can use a variety of indicators such as Moving Averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), etc. Here is a simple example of how we can do this using Python, pandas and yfinance library to fetch the stock data.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading systems are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

# Set the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-1-25')

# Calculate the 14 day RSI
delta = tickerDf['Close'].diff()
up = delta.clip(lower=0)
down = -1*delta.clip(upper=0)
ema_up = up.ewm(com=13, adjust=False).mean()
ema_down = down.ewm(com=13, adjust=False).mean()
rs = ema_up/ema_down
tickerDf['RSI'] = 100 - (100/(1 + rs))

# Use Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) as a signal for buying and selling
exp1 = tickerDf['Close'].ewm(span=12, adjust=False).mean()
exp2 = tickerDf['Close'].ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()
macd = exp1-exp2
signal = macd.ewm(span=9, adjust=False).mean()
tickerDf['MACD'] = macd - signal

# Print the DataFrame
print(tickerDf)

# Identify potential buy/sell opportunities
buy_signals = (tickerDf['MACD'] > 0) & (tickerDf['RSI'] < 30)
sell_signals = (tickerDf['MACD'] < 0) & (tickerDf['RSI'] > 70)

print('Buy signals:')
print(tickerDf[buy_signals])
print('Sell signals:')
print(tickerDf[sell_signals])
```

In this code, we first fetch the historical data for a particular stock (in this case, Apple). We then calculate the RSI and MACD for each day. Finally, we identify potential buy opportunities as days where the MACD is positive and the RSI is below 30, and potential sell opportunities as days where the MACD is negative and the RSI is above 70. 

Please note that this is a very simplistic strategy and should not be used for real trading without further refinement and testing.
