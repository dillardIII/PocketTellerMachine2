To conduct market research and analysis, we would need to gather data from various sources, analyze it and identify potential trading opportunities. Here's a simple Python code that uses the `yfinance` library to download stock data and `pandas` to analyze it. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world market research and analysis would require a much more complex approach.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-1-25')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Calculate the moving average
tickerDf['MA_50'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(50).mean()
tickerDf['MA_200'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(200).mean()

# Identify potential trading opportunities
# A common strategy is to buy when the 50-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average
tickerDf['Buy_Signal'] = (tickerDf['MA_50'] > tickerDf['MA_200'])

# Print potential trading opportunities
print(tickerDf[tickerDf['Buy_Signal'] == True])
```

This code downloads historical data for the Apple stock and calculates the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. It then identifies the days where the 50-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average, which is a common trading strategy.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world market research and analysis would require a much more complex approach. Also, this code does not take into account transaction costs, taxes, and other factors that could affect the profitability of a trading strategy. Always consult with a financial advisor before making trading decisions.
