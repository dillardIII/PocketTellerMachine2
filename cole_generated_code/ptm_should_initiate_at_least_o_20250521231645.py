Sure, here's a simple example of how you might initiate a trade using Python. This example assumes you have a method for determining whether to buy or sell, and that you're using a fictional trading API that has "buy" and "sell" methods:

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, trading_api):
        self.trading_api = trading_api

    def determine_strategy(self):
        # This is a placeholder for your actual strategy.
        # It randomly decides to buy or sell for demonstration purposes.
        return random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])

    def initiate_trade(self):
        strategy = self.determine_strategy()
        if strategy == 'buy':
            self.trading_api.buy()
        elif strategy == 'sell':
            self.trading_api.sell()

# Assuming you have a TradingAPI class defined somewhere
trading_api = TradingAPI()
ptm = PTM(trading_api)

# Initiate a trade to test the strategy
ptm.initiate_trade()
```

This is a very simplified example. In a real-world application, you'd likely have more complex logic in your `determine_strategy` method, and your `buy` and `sell` methods would likely need to take parameters specifying what to buy or sell. You might also have methods for analyzing the results of your trades to determine the effectiveness of your strategies.
