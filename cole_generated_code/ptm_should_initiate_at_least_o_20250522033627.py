Here's a simple example of how you might initiate a trade using the Alpaca API, a popular service for algorithmic trading. This code will buy one share of Apple stock. Please note that you need to replace `'APCA-API-KEY-ID'` and `'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY'` with your actual API key and secret key.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

def initiate_trade():
    symbol = 'AAPL'  # Apple stock
    qty = 1  # Number of shares to buy
    order = api.submit_order(
        symbol=symbol,
        qty=qty,
        side='buy',
        type='market',
        time_in_force='gtc'
    )
    return order

def evaluate_performance():
    account = api.get_account()
    print('Buying power: ', account.buying_power)
    print('Portfolio value: ', account.portfolio_value)
    positions = api.list_positions()
    for position in positions:
        print(f"Symbol: {position.symbol}, Qty: {position.qty}, Avg Price: {position.avg_entry_price}")

# Initiate a trade
initiate_trade()

# Evaluate performance
evaluate_performance()
```

This is a very basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would want to implement more sophisticated trading strategies and performance evaluation methods. Also, remember to handle exceptions and edge cases.
