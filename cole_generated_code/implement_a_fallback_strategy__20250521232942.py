Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This is a very basic example and the fallback strategy is simply to print a message and return an empty dictionary. In a real-world scenario, the fallback strategy could be more complex.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for the actual backtest implementation
    # It should return a dictionary with the backtest results
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy.")
    # This is a placeholder for the actual fallback strategy implementation
    # It should return a dictionary with the fallback results
    return {}

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    backtest_results = backtest_strategy(strategy)
    if not backtest_results:
        backtest_results = fallback_strategy()
    return backtest_results

# Example usage:
strategy = "Buy and hold"
results = execute_strategy(strategy)
```

In this code, `execute_strategy` is the main function. It first tries to backtest the given strategy by calling `backtest_strategy`. If no results are found (i.e., if `backtest_strategy` returns an empty dictionary or `None`), it then calls `fallback_strategy` to get the fallback results.
