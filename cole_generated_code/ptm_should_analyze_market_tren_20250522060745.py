To analyze market trends and patterns, we need to use historical data. We can use libraries like pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for data visualization, and sklearn for machine learning. Here is a simple example of how you can analyze market trends using Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming you have market data in a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Convert date into number of days as date cannot be used directly for prediction
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data['Date'] = (data['Date'] - pd.to_datetime('1970-01-01')).dt.total_seconds() / (24 * 60 * 60)

# Split the data into train and test data
train_data = data[:int(0.8*len(data))]
test_data = data[int(0.8*len(data)):]

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(np.array(train_data['Date']).reshape(-1,1), train_data['Price'])

# Predict the prices for test data
predicted_price = model.predict(np.array(test_data['Date']).reshape(-1,1))

# Plot the predicted prices with actual prices
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.title('Market Trends')
plt.xlabel('Days')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.plot(data['Date'], data['Price'], color='blue', label='Actual Price')
plt.plot(test_data['Date'], predicted_price, color='red', label='Predicted Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This is a very basic model and might not give very accurate results. For more accurate results, you can use more complex models like ARIMA, LSTM, etc. Also, you should use more features like opening price, closing price, etc. for prediction. 

Please note that trading based on this model can be risky and you should use proper risk management strategies. Also, this code assumes that you have the market data in a CSV file with 'Date' and 'Price' columns. You might need to modify the code according to your data.
