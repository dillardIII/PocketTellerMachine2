Here is a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This example assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs the backtest and returns the results or `None` if no results were found. The fallback strategy in this case is to return a message saying that no backtest results were found.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function would contain the code to run the backtest
    # For this example, it just returns None
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function contains the fallback strategy
    # In this case, it's just a print statement
    print("No backtest results found. Please try again later.")

def main():
    # Run the backtest
    results = run_backtest()

    # If no results were found, use the fallback strategy
    if results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Otherwise, do something with the results
        print("Backtest results:", results)

# Run the main function
main()
```

This is a very basic example. In a real-world scenario, your `run_backtest()` function might be more complex and your fallback strategy might involve more than just printing a message. For example, you might want to send an email notification, log the event, retry the backtest after a certain amount of time, etc.
