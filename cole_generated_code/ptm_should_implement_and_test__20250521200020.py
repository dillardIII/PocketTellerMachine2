Sure, here is a simple Python code that implements a basic moving average crossover trading strategy using pandas. This strategy is not guaranteed to increase potential wins, but it is a common starting point for algorithmic trading. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
data = yf.download('AAPL','2020-01-01','2021-12-31')

# Calculate short-term simple moving average
short_sma = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate long-term simple moving average
long_sma = data['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create signals based on crossover
data['signal'] = 0.0
data['signal'][short_sma > long_sma] = 1.0

# Generate trading orders
data['position'] = data['signal'].diff()

# Print data
print(data)

# The result is a DataFrame that indicates when to buy and sell the stock. 
# A '1' in the position column means to buy and a '-1' means to sell.
```

Please note, this is a very basic trading strategy and should not be used for actual trading without further improvements and risk management. Always do your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor. 

Also, the yfinance library is used here to download the historical data, make sure to install it using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance
```
