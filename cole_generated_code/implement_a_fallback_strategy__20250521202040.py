Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to return a message saying no results were found, but you could replace this with any other fallback strategy you prefer.

```python
def backtest_strategy(data):
    # Assuming backtest_results() is a function that performs backtesting and returns results
    results = backtest_results(data)
    
    if not results:
        # Fallback strategy: return a message saying no results were found
        return "No backtest results were found. Please try again with different data."
    
    return results
```

In this function, `backtest_results(data)` is a hypothetical function that performs the backtesting and returns the results. If no results are found (i.e., if `results` is `None` or an empty list), the function returns a message saying no results were found. Otherwise, it returns the results.

Please replace `backtest_results(data)` with your actual backtesting function and adjust the code as needed based on how your function works and what it returns.
