Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic trading strategy. In this case, I'll use a simple moving average crossover strategy. This strategy buys a stock when its short-term moving average crosses above its long-term moving average, and sells when the opposite is true.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr

# Download historical data for required stocks
ticker = "AAPL"
yf.pdr_override()
data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

# Calculate short-term simple moving average
short_sma = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate long-term simple moving average
long_sma = data['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create signals based on crossover
data['Buy_Signal'] = (short_sma > long_sma)

# Calculate daily returns
data['Daily_Returns'] = data['Close'].pct_change()

# Create column for Strategy Returns by multiplying the daily returns by the position
data['Strategy_Returns'] = data['Daily_Returns'] * data['Buy_Signal'].shift()

# Print the DataFrame
print(data)
```

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and is not recommended for actual trading. It does not take into account transaction costs, slippage, risk management, or other important factors. For a real trading strategy, you would need to consider these and many other factors.

Also, you need to install the `yfinance` and `pandas_datareader` libraries to run this code. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas_datareader
```
