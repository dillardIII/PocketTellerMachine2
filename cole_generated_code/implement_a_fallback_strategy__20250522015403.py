Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the program will print a message and then perform some default action.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest logic
    # You should replace this with your actual backtest code
    backtest_results = None

    try:
        # Run the backtest
        backtest_results = run_backtest(strategy)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while backtesting: {e}")
    
    # Check if backtest results were found
    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        
        # This is your fallback strategy
        # You should replace this with your actual fallback code
        fallback_strategy = "Fallback Strategy"
        backtest_results = run_backtest(fallback_strategy)

    return backtest_results

def run_backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest logic
    # You should replace this with your actual backtest code
    print(f"Running backtest for strategy: {strategy}")
    return None

# Run the backtest strategy
backtest_strategy("Test Strategy")
```

In this example, `run_backtest(strategy)` is a placeholder function that you would need to replace with your actual backtest code. The same goes for the `fallback_strategy` - you would need to replace this with your actual fallback strategy.
