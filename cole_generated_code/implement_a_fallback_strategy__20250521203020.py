Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, the fallback strategy is to simply print a message and return an empty dictionary. However, in a real-world application, you might want to implement a more complex fallback strategy.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume we have a function `run_backtest` that runs the backtest
    # and returns a dictionary with the results, or None if no results were found
    results = run_backtest(strategy)

    # If no results were found, implement the fallback strategy
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # The fallback strategy could be anything, for example returning an empty dictionary
        return {}

    # If results were found, return them
    return results

def run_backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for the actual backtest implementation
    # In a real-world application, this would run the backtest and return the results
    # For this example, let's assume that no results are found and return None
    return None

# Test the function with a dummy strategy
strategy = "Dummy strategy"
print(backtest_strategy(strategy))
```

This will print "No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy." and return an empty dictionary.
