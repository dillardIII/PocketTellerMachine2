Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found:

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume backtest() is a function that returns backtest results
    results = backtest(strategy)

    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found for the strategy. Implementing fallback strategy...")
        # Assume fallback_strategy() is a function that implements a fallback strategy
        fallback_results = fallback_strategy()
        return fallback_results

    return results

# Test the function with a strategy
strategy = "Strategy Name"
backtest_strategy(strategy)
```

In this code, `backtest_strategy()` is a function that takes a strategy as an argument. It then calls a function `backtest()` to get the backtest results for the strategy. If no results are found (i.e., `results` is `None` or an empty list), it prints a message and then calls a function `fallback_strategy()` to implement a fallback strategy. The results of the fallback strategy are then returned. If backtest results are found, they are returned directly.

Please replace `backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` with actual functions that perform these tasks in your application.
