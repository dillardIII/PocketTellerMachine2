Sure, here is a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python when no backtest results are found. I will use a simple print statement as a fallback, but you can replace it with any action you want to take when no backtest results are found.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume this function returns the backtest results
    # If no results are found, it returns None
    return strategy.run_backtest()

def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")

def main():
    strategy = MyTradingStrategy()  # Replace with your strategy

    backtest_results = backtest_strategy(strategy)

    if backtest_results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results:", backtest_results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, `MyTradingStrategy()` is a placeholder for your actual trading strategy. The `backtest_strategy()` function is assumed to run the backtest and return the results. If no results are found, it returns `None`.

The `main()` function runs the backtest and checks if any results were found. If no results were found, it calls the `fallback_strategy()`.
