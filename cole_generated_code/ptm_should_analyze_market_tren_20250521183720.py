To analyze market trends and patterns, we can use libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computations, matplotlib for plotting graphs, and sklearn for machine learning. Here's a simple example of how you might use these libraries to analyze market trends.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take many more factors into consideration.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load market data into a pandas DataFrame
# For this example, let's assume we have a CSV file with market data
market_data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Let's assume the data has a 'Date' column and a 'Price' column
# We'll convert the 'Date' column to datetime format
market_data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(market_data['Date'])

# Set 'Date' as the index
market_data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Calculate moving averages
market_data['MA_50'] = market_data['Price'].rolling(50).mean()
market_data['MA_200'] = market_data['Price'].rolling(200).mean()

# Plot the price and the moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(market_data['Price'], label='Price')
plt.plot(market_data['MA_50'], label='50-day MA')
plt.plot(market_data['MA_200'], label='200-day MA')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Identify potential trading opportunities
# A common strategy is to look for crossovers between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages
# A "golden cross" (50-day MA moves above 200-day MA) is a bullish signal
# A "death cross" (50-day MA moves below 200-day MA) is a bearish signal
golden_crosses = market_data[(market_data['MA_50'] > market_data['MA_200']) & (market_data['MA_50'].shift(1) < market_data['MA_200'].shift(1))]
death_crosses = market_data[(market_data['MA_50'] < market_data['MA_200']) & (market_data['MA_50'].shift(1) > market_data['MA_200'].shift(1))]

print('Golden crosses:')
print(golden_crosses)

print('Death crosses:')
print(death_crosses)
```

This code will load market data from a CSV file, calculate 50-day and 200-day moving averages, plot the price and the moving averages, and identify dates where "golden crosses" and "death crosses" occur. These are potential trading opportunities that PTM could explore further.
