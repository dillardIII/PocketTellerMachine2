The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market.

Here's a simple Python code to generate a basic RSI strategy:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime
from pyti.relative_strength_index import relative_strength_index as rsi

def calculate_rsi(data, window):
    delta = data.diff()
    up, down = delta.copy(), delta.copy()
    up[up < 0] = 0
    down[down > 0] = 0

    average_gain = up.rolling(window).mean()
    average_loss = abs(down.rolling(window).mean())

    rs = average_gain / average_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi

def implement_rsi_strategy(prices, window=14):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=prices.index)
    signals['price'] = prices
    signals['RSI'] = calculate_rsi(prices, window)
    signals['long_entry'] = signals['RSI'] < 30
    signals['long_exit'] = signals['RSI'] > 70
    signals['positions_long'] = signals['long_entry'].astype(int)
    signals['positions_long'][signals['long_exit']] = 0
    return signals

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end=datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))

# Implement the strategy
signals = implement_rsi_strategy(data['Close'])

print(signals)
```

This code downloads historical price data for AAPL from Yahoo Finance, calculates the RSI with a window of 14 days (which is the default), and generates trading signals based on the RSI. A long entry is signaled when the RSI drops below 30 (indicating oversold conditions), and a long exit is signaled when the RSI rises above 70 (indicating overbought conditions). The resulting dataframe contains the price, RSI, and trading signals for each day.
