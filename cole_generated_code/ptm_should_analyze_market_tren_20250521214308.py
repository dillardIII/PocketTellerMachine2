To analyze market trends and patterns, we can use libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download the stock price data, matplotlib for plotting, and sklearn for machine learning. Here is a simple example of how you can analyze market trends and patterns:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL','2020-01-01','2022-01-01')

# Calculate the moving average
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Plotting the stock price and moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Stock Price')
plt.plot(data['SMA_50'], label='50-day moving average')
plt.plot(data['SMA_200'], label='200-day moving average')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()

# Prepare the data for machine learning model
data['PriceNextMonth'] = data['Close'].shift(-30)
data = data.dropna()

X = data[['Close', 'SMA_50', 'SMA_200']]
y = data['PriceNextMonth']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Compare predictions with actual values
df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test, 'Predicted': predictions})
print(df)
```

This script downloads the historical price data for AAPL, calculates the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and plots them. Then it prepares the data for a machine learning model, trains a linear regression model, makes predictions for the next month's price, and compares the predictions with the actual values.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world stock market prediction is a complex task that involves many more factors.
