Sure, here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` which runs the backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, it falls back to a default strategy.

```python
def fallback_strategy():
    # This is your fallback strategy
    print("Running fallback strategy...")

def run_strategy():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None or len(results) == 0:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Process your results here
        print("Backtest results found and processed.")

# Run the strategy
run_strategy()
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` is a placeholder for your actual backtest function. If the backtest results are empty or `None`, the code runs the `fallback_strategy()`. You would replace the `fallback_strategy()` and the `print` statement in the `else` clause with your actual fallback strategy and result processing code, respectively.
