Sure, here is a basic Python code to simulate a trading system. Please note that this is a simplified version and real-world trading systems are much more complex and require careful handling of financial data.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []
        self.wins = 0
        self.losses = 0

    def initiate_trade(self):
        # Simulate a trade with a 50/50 win/loss chance
        trade_outcome = random.choice(['win', 'loss'])
        self.trades.append(trade_outcome)

        if trade_outcome == 'win':
            self.wins += 1
        else:
            self.losses += 1

        print(f"Trade outcome: {trade_outcome}")
        print(f"Total trades: {len(self.trades)}, Wins: {self.wins}, Losses: {self.losses}")

# Create a PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate at least one trade
ptm.initiate_trade()
```

In this code, we create a class `PTM` to represent the trading system. The `initiate_trade` method simulates a trade with a 50/50 win/loss chance. The outcome of the trade is recorded in the `trades` list, and the `wins` and `losses` counters are updated accordingly. Finally, we create a `PTM` instance and initiate at least one trade.
