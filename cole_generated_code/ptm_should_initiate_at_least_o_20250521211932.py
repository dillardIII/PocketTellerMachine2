Sure, here is a simple Python code to simulate a trading scenario. In this code, PTM (Python Trading Model) will initiate a trade and then randomly decide whether it's a win or a loss. This is a very basic example and real-world trading models would be much more complex and based on various factors.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []
        self.wins = 0
        self.losses = 0

    def initiate_trade(self):
        trade_outcome = random.choice(['win', 'loss'])
        self.trades.append(trade_outcome)

        if trade_outcome == 'win':
            self.wins += 1
        else:
            self.losses += 1

        return trade_outcome

# Create an instance of PTM
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
trade_outcome = ptm.initiate_trade()

print(f"PTM initiated a trade. The outcome was a {trade_outcome}.")
print(f"Total trades: {len(ptm.trades)}")
print(f"Wins: {ptm.wins}")
print(f"Losses: {ptm.losses}")
```

In this code, we first import the `random` module to randomly decide the outcome of a trade. We then define a class `PTM` with methods to initiate a trade and keep track of wins and losses. We create an instance of `PTM`, initiate a trade, and then print the outcome of the trade and the total number of trades, wins, and losses.
