Sure, here's a simple Python code that simulates a basic trading strategy. This strategy is just for demonstration and may not actually increase the number of trades or profitability. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class TradingStrategy:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.buy_price = 0
        self.sell_price = 0
        self.balance = 10000  # initial balance
        self.shares = 0  # number of shares

    def buy(self, price):
        self.shares = self.balance / price
        self.balance = 0
        self.buy_price = price

    def sell(self, price):
        self.balance = self.shares * price
        self.shares = 0
        self.sell_price = price

    def implement_strategy(self):
        for i in range(1, len(self.data)):
            if self.data[i] > self.data[i-1] and self.balance > 0:
                self.buy(self.data[i])
            elif self.data[i] < self.data[i-1] and self.shares > 0:
                self.sell(self.data[i])

        # sell any remaining shares at the end of the period
        if self.shares > 0:
            self.sell(self.data[-1])

        return self.balance

# Test the strategy
prices = np.random.rand(100)  # generate random prices
strategy = TradingStrategy(prices)
final_balance = strategy.implement_strategy()
print(f"Final balance: {final_balance}")
```

This strategy buys when the price goes up and sells when the price goes down. It's a very naive strategy and in real-world trading, you would need a much more sophisticated strategy that takes into account many other factors.
