Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a simple implementation of an EMA Crossover Analyzer using Python and the pandas library. This code assumes that you already have a pandas DataFrame 'df' with 'Close' prices.

```python
import pandas as pd

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def ema_crossover(data, short_window, long_window):
    short_ema = calculate_ema(data, short_window)
    long_ema = calculate_ema(data, long_window)

    buy_signals = (short_ema > long_ema) & (short_ema.shift() < long_ema.shift())
    sell_signals = (short_ema < long_ema) & (short_ema.shift() > long_ema.shift())

    return buy_signals, sell_signals

# Assuming df is your DataFrame and 'Close' is the column with closing prices
buy_signals, sell_signals = ema_crossover(df['Close'], 12, 26)

# Adding signals to the data frame
df['Buy_Signal'] = buy_signals
df['Sell_Signal'] = sell_signals
```

This code calculates the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for a short window and a long window. It then finds the points where the short EMA crosses the long EMA. These crossover points are often used as signals in trading. When the short EMA crosses above the long EMA, it's a buy signal, and when it crosses below, it's a sell signal.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and might need to be adjusted to fit your specific needs. Also, this code does not include any trading fees or slippage and assumes all trades are executed at the closing price.
