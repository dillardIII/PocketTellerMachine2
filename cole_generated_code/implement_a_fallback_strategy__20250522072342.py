Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, I'm assuming that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs a backtest and returns the results, or `None` if no results are found. The fallback strategy here is to run a default backtest and return those results if no backtest results are found.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    # Return the results, or None if no results are found
    pass

def run_default_backtest():
    # Your default backtest code here
    # Return the results
    pass

def get_backtest_results():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found, running default backtest.")
        results = run_default_backtest()
    return results
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results()` is the function you would call to get backtest results. It first tries to run the backtest and get results. If no results are found (i.e., `run_backtest()` returns `None`), it then runs the default backtest and returns those results instead.
