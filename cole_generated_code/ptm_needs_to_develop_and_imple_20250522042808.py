Sure, I can provide a basic example of a Python code for a simple trading strategy. This strategy will be based on a simple moving average (SMA). When the price crosses the SMA from below, it will signal to buy, and when it crosses from above, it will signal to sell.

Please note that this is a very simplified strategy and is not recommended for actual trading without further modifications and testing.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    return data.rolling(window=window).mean()

def implement_strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Short moving average
    signals['short_mavg'] = calculate_sma(data, short_window)

    # Long moving average
    signals['long_mavg'] = calculate_sma(data, long_window)

    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                                > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   

    # Generate trading orders
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Download historical data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Implement the strategy
signals = implement_strategy(data['Close'], 50, 200)

# Print the signals
print(signals)
```

This code will print a DataFrame with the signals to buy or sell. A value of 1.0 in the 'positions' column means a buy signal, and a value of -1.0 means a sell signal.
