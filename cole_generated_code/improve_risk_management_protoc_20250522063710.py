Sure, I can help you write a simple Python code to calculate the risk of a trade. However, please note that risk management in trading is a complex topic that involves many factors such as the market volatility, the trader's risk tolerance, the size of the trade, etc. This simple code will only calculate the risk based on the stop loss level and the amount of capital at risk.

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, entry_price, stop_loss, capital_at_risk, total_capital):
        self.entry_price = entry_price
        self.stop_loss = stop_loss
        self.capital_at_risk = capital_at_risk
        self.total_capital = total_capital

    def calculate_risk(self):
        risk_per_share = self.entry_price - self.stop_loss
        shares_to_buy = self.capital_at_risk / risk_per_share
        risk_percentage = (self.capital_at_risk / self.total_capital) * 100

        return risk_per_share, shares_to_buy, risk_percentage


# Example usage:
trade = Trade(entry_price=100, stop_loss=90, capital_at_risk=1000, total_capital=10000)
risk_per_share, shares_to_buy, risk_percentage = trade.calculate_risk()

print(f"Risk per share: {risk_per_share}")
print(f"Shares to buy: {shares_to_buy}")
print(f"Risk percentage: {risk_percentage}%")
```

In this code, we first define a `Trade` class with `entry_price`, `stop_loss`, `capital_at_risk`, and `total_capital` as attributes. The `calculate_risk` method calculates the risk per share, the number of shares to buy, and the risk percentage. 

The risk per share is calculated as the difference between the entry price and the stop loss. The number of shares to buy is calculated as the capital at risk divided by the risk per share. The risk percentage is calculated as the capital at risk divided by the total capital, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

Please note that this is a very basic risk management strategy and may not be suitable for all trading scenarios. Always consult with a financial advisor or use a more sophisticated risk management strategy for real trading.
