Analyzing market trends and data to identify potential profitable trades involves complex algorithms and data analysis. It requires historical data, real-time data, and various libraries to perform the analysis. Here is a simple example of how you could analyze historical stock data using Python, pandas, and yfinance library.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'
ticker_data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
short_rolling = ticker_data.rolling(window=20).mean()
long_rolling = ticker_data.rolling(window=100).mean()

# Plot closing price, short-term and long-term moving averages 
plt.figure(figsize=(16,9))
plt.title('Close Price History')
plt.plot(ticker_data['Close'], label=ticker, color='blue')
plt.plot(short_rolling['Close'], label='20 day rolling mean', color='red')
plt.plot(long_rolling['Close'], label='100 day rolling mean', color='green')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()

# Identify potential buy/sell opportunities
buy_sell_signals = pd.DataFrame(index=ticker_data.index)
buy_sell_signals['signal'] = 0.0
buy_sell_signals['short_mavg'] = short_rolling['Close']
buy_sell_signals['long_mavg'] = long_rolling['Close']

# Generate signals
buy_sell_signals['signal'][short_rolling['Close'] > long_rolling['Close']] = 1.0
buy_sell_signals['positions'] = buy_sell_signals['signal'].diff()

# Print potential buy/sell dates
print(buy_sell_signals[buy_sell_signals['positions'] != 0])
```

This is a simple moving average crossover strategy. It suggests buying the stock when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, and selling the stock when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and doesn't take into account many factors that could influence the profitability of these trades. It's recommended to use more complex strategies and consider more factors for real trading.
