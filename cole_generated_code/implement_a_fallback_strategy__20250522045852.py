Here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This is a very basic example and the fallback strategy just prints a message. In a real-world scenario, the fallback strategy could be more complex such as running a different backtest or notifying the user.

```python
def run_backtest(strategy):
    # Run the backtest for the given strategy
    # This is a placeholder function and should be replaced with actual backtest code
    pass

def get_backtest_results(strategy):
    # Get the backtest results for the given strategy
    # This is a placeholder function and should be replaced with actual code to fetch backtest results
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # Fallback strategy when no backtest results are found
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")

# Main code
strategy = "Strategy1"  # Replace with actual strategy
run_backtest(strategy)
results = get_backtest_results(strategy)

if not results:
    fallback_strategy()
```

Please replace the placeholder functions `run_backtest` and `get_backtest_results` with the actual code. The `fallback_strategy` function can also be replaced with a more suitable fallback strategy as per your requirements.
