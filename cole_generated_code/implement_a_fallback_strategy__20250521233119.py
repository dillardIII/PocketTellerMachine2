Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs your backtest and returns the results, or `None` if no results are found.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    # Return the results, or None if no results are found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your fallback strategy here
    pass

# Run the backtest
backtest_results = run_backtest()

# If no results are found, run the fallback strategy
if backtest_results is None:
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
    fallback_results = fallback_strategy()
else:
    print("Backtest results found.")
```

In this code, if `run_backtest()` returns `None`, the program will print a message and then run `fallback_strategy()`. If `run_backtest()` returns something other than `None`, the program will simply print a message indicating that backtest results were found.

You'll need to replace `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` with your actual backtest and fallback strategy code.
