Sure, I can help with that. However, I need to know what you mean by "fallback strategy". It could mean a lot of things. For example, it could mean returning a default value, raising an exception, retrying the backtest, or something else. Could you please clarify? 

For now, I will provide a simple Python function that performs a backtest and returns a default value if no results are found:

```python
def perform_backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for the actual backtest logic.
    # You would replace this with your actual backtest code.
    backtest_results = run_backtest(strategy)  # replace with your backtest function

    # Fallback strategy: if no results, return a default value.
    if not backtest_results:
        print("No backtest results found. Returning default value.")
        return {"success": False, "results": "Default Value"}

    return {"success": True, "results": backtest_results}

# replace "my_strategy" with your actual strategy
print(perform_backtest("my_strategy"))
```

In this code, `run_backtest(strategy)` is a placeholder for the function that performs the backtest. If the backtest results are empty (which I'm assuming means that no results were found), the function returns a dictionary with a "success" status of `False` and a default value. If results were found, it returns a dictionary with a "success" status of `True` and the backtest results.
