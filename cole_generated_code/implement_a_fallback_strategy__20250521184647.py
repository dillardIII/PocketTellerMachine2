Sure, here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this example, we'll assume that the `backtest()` function is supposed to return some backtest results. If it doesn't, we'll call a `fallback()` function.

```python
def backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    # This function should return the backtest results if successful
    pass

def fallback():
    # Your fallback strategy here
    # This function should return the fallback results
    pass

def main():
    results = backtest()
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy...")
        results = fallback()
    return results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, `backtest()` and `fallback()` are placeholders for your actual backtest and fallback strategy implementations. If `backtest()` fails to return results (i.e., it returns `None`), the `fallback()` function is called.
