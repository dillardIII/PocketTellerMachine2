Creating a Python program that analyzes market trends and adjusts trading strategies is a complex task. It requires knowledge of finance, machine learning, and data analysis. Here is a simple example of how you might start. This example uses the pandas library to analyze data and the yfinance library to get stock data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

def analyze_trends(stock):
    # Download historical data as dataframe
    data = yf.download(stock, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

    # Use only Close price for prediction
    data = data[['Close']]

    # Predict for the next 30 days
    forecast_out = 30

    # Create another column (the target) shifted 'n' units up
    data['Prediction'] = data[['Close']].shift(-forecast_out)

    # Create the independent and dependent data sets
    X = data.drop(['Prediction'], 1)[:-forecast_out]
    y = data['Prediction'][:-forecast_out]

    # Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing
    x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

    # Create and train the Linear Regression Model
    lr = LinearRegression()
    lr.fit(x_train, y_train)

    # Test the model using score
    lr_confidence = lr.score(x_test, y_test)
    print("lr confidence: ", lr_confidence)

    # Set x_forecast equal to the last 30 rows of the original data set from Close column
    x_forecast = data.drop(['Prediction'], 1)[:-forecast_out]
    x_forecast = x_forecast.tail(forecast_out)

    # Print linear regression model predictions for the next 'n' days
    lr_prediction = lr.predict(x_forecast)
    print(lr_prediction)

# Analyze trends for a specific stock
analyze_trends('AAPL')
```

This script downloads historical data for a specific stock (in this case, Apple), trains a simple linear regression model on the closing prices, and predicts the closing price for the next 30 days.

Please note that this is a very basic example. Real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take many more factors into account. Also, this script does not actually adjust any trading strategies. It simply predicts future prices based on past data. Adjusting trading strategies based on these predictions would require additional logic and depends on the specific trading strategies used.
