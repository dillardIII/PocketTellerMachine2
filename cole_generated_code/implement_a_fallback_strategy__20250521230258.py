Sure, here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` which returns the backtest results, and a function `fallback_strategy()` which is your fallback strategy when no backtest results are found.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    results = run_backtest()

    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
        results = fallback_strategy()

    return results

def run_backtest():
    # Your code to run backtest here
    # This is just a placeholder
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your code for fallback strategy here
    # This is just a placeholder
    return "Fallback results"

# Test the function
print(get_backtest_results())
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results()` first tries to get the results from `run_backtest()`. If no results are found (i.e., `results` is `None` or empty), it runs the `fallback_strategy()` and returns its results. Please replace `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` with your actual functions.
