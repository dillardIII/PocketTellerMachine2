Here is a simple Python code using pandas and yfinance libraries to monitor market trends. This code fetches the data of a specific stock (in this case, Apple Inc.) and calculates its moving average to determine the trend. Please note that this is a very basic implementation and real-world trading decisions involve much more complex algorithms and factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data for this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start=(datetime.now()-timedelta(days=365)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), end=datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))

# Calculate the moving average
tickerDf['MA_50'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
tickerDf['MA_200'] = tickerDf['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Print the last 5 rows of the data
print(tickerDf.tail())

# Basic trading decision based on moving average
if tickerDf['MA_50'].iloc[-1] > tickerDf['MA_200'].iloc[-1]:
    print("The trend is upward. You may consider buying the stock.")
else:
    print("The trend is downward. You may consider selling the stock.")
```

This code only provides a simple moving average strategy. In reality, trading involves much more factors like volume, volatility, news, company fundamentals, etc. Also, this code does not generate any trading activity. For that, you would need to integrate with a trading platform API like Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, etc. and that involves real money and risk. Please use this code as a starting point and not as a complete trading bot.
