Sure, here's a simple Python code that simulates a trade execution. This code doesn't actually execute a real trade but it's a good starting point for understanding how a trading bot might work. 

```python
import datetime
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, ticker, volume, price, trade_type):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.volume = volume
        self.price = price
        self.trade_type = trade_type

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []

    def execute_trade(self, trade):
        print(f"Executing {trade.trade_type} trade for {trade.volume} of {trade.ticker} at {trade.price}")
        self.trades.append(trade)

# Simulate tomorrow's date
tomorrow = datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(days=1)

# Create PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Simulate a trade
ticker = "AAPL"
volume = 100
price = random.uniform(100, 200)  # Simulate a price between 100 and 200
trade_type = "buy"

trade = Trade(ticker, volume, price, trade_type)

# Schedule trade for tomorrow
if datetime.date.today() < tomorrow:
    ptm.execute_trade(trade)
```

This code creates a `Trade` class to represent a trade and a `PTM` class to represent the trading system. The `PTM` class has a method `execute_trade` which simulates the execution of a trade.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real trading systems are much more complex. They need to interact with a trading platform using an API, handle errors, manage funds, track performance, and much more.
