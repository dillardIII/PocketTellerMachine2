To complete this task, we will use the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis, and yfinance library to download the stock data. We will use matplotlib library for data visualization. Here is a simple example of how you can analyze market trends and patterns:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters
register_matplotlib_converters()

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL','2016-01-01','2021-12-31')

# Calculate moving averages
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Plot the close price and the moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price', color='blue')
plt.plot(data['SMA_50'], label='50 Day SMA', color='red')
plt.plot(data['SMA_200'], label='200 Day SMA', color='green')
plt.title('Apple Stock Price with 50 and 200 Day Moving Averages')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Identify potential trading opportunities
# Buy when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day SMA
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['SMA_50'] > data['SMA_200'])

# Sell when the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA
data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['SMA_50'] < data['SMA_200'])

# Print potential trading opportunities
print(data.loc[data['Buy_Signal']])
print(data.loc[data['Sell_Signal']])
```

This script downloads the historical data of Apple's stock, calculates the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and plots them. It then identifies potential trading opportunities by generating buy signals when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average, and sell signals when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average.

Please note that this is a simple example and real-world trading systems are much more complex and take into account many more factors. Always consult with a financial advisor before making trading decisions.
