Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trading operation. This code uses a random number generator to decide whether the trade results in a win or a loss.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 0

    def trade(self):
        # Generate a random number between 0 and 1
        outcome = random.random()
        
        # If the number is less than 0.5, the trade is a loss
        if outcome < 0.5:
            print("Trade resulted in a loss.")
            self.balance -= 100
        # If the number is greater than or equal to 0.5, the trade is a win
        else:
            print("Trade resulted in a win.")
            self.balance += 100

        print(f"Current balance: {self.balance}")

# Create a PTM object
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
ptm.trade()
```

This code creates a class called PTM with a method called trade. The trade method generates a random number between 0 and 1. If the number is less than 0.5, the trade results in a loss and the balance is decreased by 100. If the number is greater than or equal to 0.5, the trade results in a win and the balance is increased by 100. The current balance is then printed.

Please note that this is a very simplified version of a trading system. In a real-world application, you would need to consider many other factors such as the price of the asset, the amount of the asset to buy or sell, the current market conditions, and so on.
