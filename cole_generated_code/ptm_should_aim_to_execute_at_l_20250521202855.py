Sure, I can provide you with a simple Python code that simulates a trade. However, please note that this is a very basic example and real trading involves a lot more complexity and risk.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # starting balance
        self.stocks = 0  # starting stocks

    def trade(self):
        # Simulate the price of the stock
        stock_price = random.uniform(50, 150)

        # Decide whether to buy or sell
        if self.stocks == 0 or random.random() < 0.5:
            # Buy stocks
            stocks_to_buy = self.balance // stock_price
            if stocks_to_buy > 0:
                self.balance -= stocks_to_buy * stock_price
                self.stocks += stocks_to_buy
                print(f"Bought {stocks_to_buy} stocks at {stock_price} each. Balance is now {self.balance}.")
        else:
            # Sell stocks
            stocks_to_sell = random.randint(1, self.stocks)
            self.balance += stocks_to_sell * stock_price
            self.stocks -= stocks_to_sell
            print(f"Sold {stocks_to_sell} stocks at {stock_price} each. Balance is now {self.balance}.")

ptm = PTM()
ptm.trade()  # Execute a trade
```

This script creates a simple trading model where PTM decides whether to buy or sell stocks based on a random decision. The price of the stock is also randomly generated. When buying, PTM spends as much of its balance as it can, and when selling, it sells a random number of stocks. The result of the trade is then printed out.
