Here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that runs a backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, the fallback strategy is executed.

```python
def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
    # Implement your fallback strategy here

def main():
    backtest_results = run_backtest()

    if not backtest_results:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")

# Run the main function
main()
```

In the `fallback_strategy()` function, you can implement the specific actions you want to take when no backtest results are found. This could be anything from running a different type of backtest, alerting the user, logging the event, etc.
