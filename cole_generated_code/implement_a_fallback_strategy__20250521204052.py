Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to simply print a message and return an empty dictionary. You can replace this with a more appropriate strategy based on your specific requirements.

```python
def get_backtest_results(backtest_id):
    # Assume that fetch_backtest_results is a function that fetches backtest results
    # for a given backtest_id. If no results are found, it returns None.
    results = fetch_backtest_results(backtest_id)

    if results is None:
        print(f"No backtest results found for backtest_id: {backtest_id}")
        # Fallback strategy: return an empty dictionary
        return {}

    return results
```

This is a very basic fallback strategy. Depending on your specific use case, you might want to implement a more sophisticated strategy. For example, you might want to retry fetching the results a certain number of times before giving up, or you might want to fetch results for a different backtest_id if results for the given backtest_id are not found.
