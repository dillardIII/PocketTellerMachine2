Creating a Python script to analyze market trends and indicators is a complex task. It involves fetching data from financial market, processing it and applying various financial analysis techniques. Here is a simplified example of how you might start developing such a script using Python, pandas and yfinance libraries. 

This script fetches historical data for a specific stock symbol and calculates its Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as indicators. It's a very basic form of analysis and you would need to add more indicators and analysis logic to make it useful for identifying trading opportunities.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_SMA(data, window):
    return data.rolling(window = window).mean()

def calculate_EMA(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span = window, adjust = False).mean()

def analyze_stock(symbol):
    # Fetch historical market data
    data = yf.download(symbol, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")
    
    # Calculate indicators
    data['SMA'] = calculate_SMA(data['Close'], 14)
    data['EMA'] = calculate_EMA(data['Close'], 14)
    
    # Print the data
    print(data)

    # Here you might want to add logic to identify potential trading opportunities based on the calculated indicators

# Analyze a specific stock
analyze_stock('AAPL')
```

Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world stock market analysis would require a much more sophisticated approach and deeper understanding of financial markets. Also, keep in mind that trading stocks always involves risks and this script should not be used for making real trading decisions without proper knowledge and understanding.
