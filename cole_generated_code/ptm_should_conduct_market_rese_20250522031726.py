To conduct market research, we can use Python libraries such as pandas, yfinance, and matplotlib. Here is a simple example of how you can fetch stock data, analyze it, and visualize it.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real market research would involve much more complex analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-1-25')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Plot the close prices
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(tickerDf['Close'])
plt.title('Historical Close Price of ' + tickerSymbol)
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Close Price (USD)')
plt.show()
```

This code fetches the historical data of Apple Inc.'s stock prices and plots the closing prices. You can replace 'AAPL' with any other valid ticker symbol to fetch data of other stocks.

Please note that this code does not identify trading opportunities. Identifying trading opportunities requires complex algorithms and strategies which are beyond the scope of this example.
