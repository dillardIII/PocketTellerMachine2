Sure, here's a simple way to implement a fallback strategy in Python. Suppose the `get_backtest_results` function is responsible for fetching backtest results. 

``` python
def get_backtest_results():
    # Function body where backtest results are obtained
    # For simplicity, let's pretend it returns None if no results are found
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    print('Fallback strategy is now in use.')
    # Implement the fallback strategy here
    # For instance, it may involve using default parameters
    return 'default_result'

def execute_strategy():
    results = get_backtest_results() 
    if not results:
        print('No backtest results found.')
        results = fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print('Backtest results obtained successfully.')
    
    # Now you can use 'results' in further code, assured it is not None
    # Further processing on results

execute_strategy()
```

In the above code, if `get_backtest_results` does not provide any results, the `fallback_strategy` function is called which implements the fallback behavior and obtains a result by some other means. This result is then used for further processing.
