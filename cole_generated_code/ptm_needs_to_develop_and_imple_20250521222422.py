To develop and implement trading strategies, we need to consider several factors such as technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and sentiment analysis. Here is a simple Python code implementing a moving average crossover strategy using pandas library. This strategy is a part of technical analysis.

Please note that this is a simple example and real-world trading strategies can be much more complex and require a more sophisticated approach.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as pdr
from datetime import datetime

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickerSymbol, start=datetime(2019, 1, 1), end=datetime.now())

# Calculate the short-term simple moving average (SMA)
tickerData['SMA_20'] = tickerData['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-term SMA
tickerData['SMA_50'] = tickerData['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create a column to hold the trade signals
tickerData['Signal'] = 0.0

# Generate trading signals based on the crossover of the short-term and long-term SMAs
tickerData['Signal'][20:] = np.where(tickerData['SMA_20'][20:] > tickerData['SMA_50'][20:], 1.0, 0.0)

# Create a column to hold the trading positions
tickerData['Position'] = tickerData['Signal'].diff()

# Print the DataFrame
print(tickerData)
```

In this code, we are using the moving average crossover strategy, which is a common trading strategy. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it generates a buy signal. Conversely, when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, it generates a sell signal. This strategy is based on the assumption that momentum is likely to continue in the direction of the crossover.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and may not be profitable in real trading. Always backtest your strategies before live trading. Also, this code does not take into account trading fees, slippage, or other factors that could impact the profitability of a strategy.
