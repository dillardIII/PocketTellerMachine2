Sure, here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this code, we will assume that `backtest()` is a function that runs a backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, it returns `None`.

```python
def backtest():
    # This is a placeholder for your actual backtest function
    # It should return the results if successful, or None if no results are found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is your fallback strategy
    # It could be anything: another backtest with different parameters, a default set of trades, etc.
    print("Running fallback strategy...")
    pass

# Run the backtest
results = backtest()

# If no results are found, run the fallback strategy
if results is None:
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    print("Backtest results found:", results)
```

You would need to replace the `backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` functions with your actual code. The `backtest()` function should return the backtest results if successful, or `None` if no results are found. The `fallback_strategy()` function should implement your fallback strategy.

This is a very basic implementation. Depending on your needs, you might want to add more sophisticated error handling, logging, etc.
