Here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. Please note that in a real trading scenario, you would need access to a trading API and real-time market data. This code is a simplified representation and does not perform actual trading.

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, symbol, quantity):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.quantity = quantity

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []

    def initiate_trade(self, symbol, quantity):
        trade = Trade(symbol, quantity)
        self.trades.append(trade)
        print(f"Trade initiated: Bought {quantity} of {symbol}")

# Create PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
ptm.initiate_trade("AAPL", 10)
```

In this code, we have two classes: `Trade` and `PTM`. `Trade` represents a single trade, with a symbol (representing the stock) and quantity. `PTM` represents the trading system, which can initiate trades.

The `initiate_trade` method in the `PTM` class creates a new `Trade` instance and adds it to the list of trades. This represents the initiation of a trade. 

In the last two lines, we create an instance of `PTM` and initiate a trade. This represents buying 10 units of the stock represented by the symbol "AAPL".
