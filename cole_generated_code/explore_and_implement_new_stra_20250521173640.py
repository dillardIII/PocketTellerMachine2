Your request is a bit nebulous as there are numerous trading strategies that can be applied depending on various factors such as the financial instrument being traded, the market conditions and the risk profile of the investor. An engineering team can help you choose the best strategies. Here, Iâ€™m implementing a simple moving average crossover strategy using Python using the yfinance and pandas libraries.

This code assumes the use of daily timeframes, the instrument being traded is 'AAPL' and uses a short/long moving average window of 40/100 days. 

Install the required python libraries with pip before executing:

```python
pip install pandas yfinance matplotlib
```

Here is the sample python code:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# download historical market data: for 'AAPL' using yfinance
hist = yf.Ticker("AAPL").history(period="5y")

# create short simple moving average over short window
short_sma = hist.Close.rolling(window=40, min_periods=1).mean()

# create long simple moving average over long window
long_sma = hist.Close.rolling(window=100, min_periods=1).mean()

# calculate trading strategy signals (where short_sma crosses long_sma)
signals = short_sma > long_sma

# calculate daily returns of strategy
daily_returns = (signals.shift() * hist.Close.pct_change()).dropna()

# calculate cumulative returns of strategy
cumulative_returns = (1 + daily_returns).cumprod() 


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# plot strategy returns
plt.plot(cumulative_returns)
plt.title('Moving Average Crossover Strategy Returns: AAPL')
plt.show()
```

Remember, this is a simple moving average crossover strategy and it may not be the optimal trading strategy given your specific preferences and market conditions. Also, transaction costs and slippage have been ignored. Always remember, past performance is not indicative of future results. 

Performing backtesting on different strategies with varying parameters will give a better idea of what strategy fits the best. Modify the code as required.

For actual trading deployment, this code would integrate with a brokerage API, include thorough error handling, and potentially make use of different forms of execution such as limit orders to manage slippage costs.
