Sure, I'll provide a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, I'm assuming that you have a function `run_backtest()` that performs the backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, this function returns `None`.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    # Return the results, or None if no results found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your fallback strategy here
    pass

# Run the backtest
results = run_backtest()

# If no results found, run the fallback strategy
if results is None:
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    print("Backtest results found.")
    # Continue with your normal process using the results
```

In this example, `fallback_strategy()` could be any function that you want to run when no backtest results are found. This could be running a different type of backtest, alerting the user, or anything else appropriate for your application.
