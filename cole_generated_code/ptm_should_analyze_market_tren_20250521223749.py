To analyze market trends and patterns, we can use libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computation, matplotlib for visualization, and sklearn for machine learning. We'll also use yfinance to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance.

Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading systems are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'
ticker_data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate simple moving average
ticker_data['SMA'] = ticker_data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate standard deviation
ticker_data['STD'] = ticker_data['Close'].rolling(window=20).std()

# Calculate upper and lower Bollinger Bands
ticker_data['Upper_Band'] = ticker_data['SMA'] + (ticker_data['STD'] * 2)
ticker_data['Lower_Band'] = ticker_data['SMA'] - (ticker_data['STD'] * 2)

# Plot closing price and Bollinger Bands
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(ticker_data['Close'], label='Close Price', color='blue')
plt.plot(ticker_data['SMA'], label='Simple Moving Average', color='red')
plt.plot(ticker_data['Upper_Band'], label='Upper Bollinger Band', color='green')
plt.plot(ticker_data['Lower_Band'], label='Lower Bollinger Band', color='brown')
plt.fill_between(ticker_data.index, ticker_data['Lower_Band'], ticker_data['Upper_Band'], color='orange', alpha=0.1)
plt.title('Bollinger Band for {}'.format(ticker))
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Identify potential buy/sell opportunities
buy_signals = (ticker_data['Close'] < ticker_data['Lower_Band'])
sell_signals = (ticker_data['Close'] > ticker_data['Upper_Band'])

print('Potential Buy Signals:\n')
print(buy_signals[buy_signals == True])

print('\nPotential Sell Signals:\n')
print(sell_signals[sell_signals == True])
```

This code calculates the Bollinger Bands for the given ticker symbol and identifies potential buy/sell opportunities based on these bands. When the closing price crosses below the lower band, this could be a buy signal. When it crosses above the upper band, this could be a sell signal.
