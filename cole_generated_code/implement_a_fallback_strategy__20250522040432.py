Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python when no backtest results are found. This example assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs the backtest and returns the results, and a function `run_fallback()` that runs the fallback strategy.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    results = run_backtest()
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
        results = run_fallback()
    return results

def run_backtest():
    # Your code to run the backtest goes here
    # This is just a placeholder
    return {}

def run_fallback():
    # Your code to run the fallback strategy goes here
    # This is just a placeholder
    return {"fallback": True}

# Run the function
results = get_backtest_results()
print(results)
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results()` first tries to get the backtest results by calling `run_backtest()`. If `run_backtest()` returns a falsy value (like an empty dictionary, which I used as a placeholder), it prints a message and then runs the fallback strategy by calling `run_fallback()`. The results of the fallback strategy are then returned instead.

Please replace the placeholder functions `run_backtest()` and `run_fallback()` with your actual backtest and fallback strategy code.
