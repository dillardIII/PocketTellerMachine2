Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic trading strategy. This strategy will use a simple moving average (SMA) crossover to determine when to buy and sell stock. 

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading strategies are much more complex and take into account many more factors. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

def calculate_SMA(data, window):
    sma = data.rolling(window = window).mean()
    return sma

def calculate_EMA(data, window):
    ema = data.ewm(span = window, adjust = False).mean()
    return ema

def trading_strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    # Create a 'signals' DataFrame with signal information
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0
    
    # Short moving average
    signals['short_mavg'] = calculate_SMA(data, short_window)
    # Long moving average
    signals['long_mavg'] = calculate_SMA(data, long_window)
    
    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)
    
    # Generate trading orders
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()
    
    return signals

# Get the data
data = web.DataReader('AAPL', 'yahoo', start='01/01/2010', end='01/01/2022')

# Set the short and long windows
short_window = 40
long_window = 100

# Generate the trading signals
signals = trading_strategy(data['Close'], short_window, long_window)

# Print the signals
print(signals)
```

This script fetches the historical price data for Apple Inc. from Yahoo Finance, calculates the short-term (40 days) and long-term (100 days) moving averages, and generates trading signals based on the crossover of these moving averages. A buy signal is generated when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, and a sell signal is generated when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average. 

Please note that this is a very simplistic trading strategy and is not recommended for actual trading. It's just a basic example to illustrate how a trading strategy could be implemented in Python.
