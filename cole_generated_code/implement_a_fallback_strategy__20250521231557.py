Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found.

```python
class TradingAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.backtest_results = None

    def run_backtest(self):
        # Code to run backtest goes here
        # This should update self.backtest_results

    def fallback_strategy(self):
        # Code for fallback strategy goes here
        print("Running fallback strategy...")

    def execute_strategy(self):
        if self.backtest_results is None:
            print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
            self.fallback_strategy()
        else:
            print("Backtest results found. Executing main strategy...")
            # Code to execute main strategy goes here

# Usage
assistant = TradingAssistant()
assistant.run_backtest()
assistant.execute_strategy()
```

In this code, `run_backtest` method is supposed to run the backtest and update `self.backtest_results`. If `self.backtest_results` is `None` when `execute_strategy` is called, it means no backtest results were found, so the fallback strategy is executed. Otherwise, the main strategy is executed.

Please note that you need to replace the comments with the actual code to run backtest and execute strategies.
