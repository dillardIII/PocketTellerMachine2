Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the code will print a message and then proceed to a fallback strategy.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest function
    # It should return results if the backtest is successful
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your fallback strategy
    # It should be implemented to handle cases when backtest fails
    pass

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest_strategy(strategy)
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest successful. Executing strategy...")
        # Here you would typically do something with the results
        pass

# Execute the strategy
execute_strategy(my_strategy)
```

Please replace the `backtest_strategy`, `fallback_strategy`, and `execute_strategy` with your actual strategy and backtest implementation. The `my_strategy` should also be replaced with your actual strategy.
