Sure, here is a simple Python code to implement a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. 

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume we have a function that performs backtesting and returns results
    results = perform_backtest(strategy)

    # Check if results are empty
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Fallback strategy can be anything, here we just print a message
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")
        # Process the results
        process_results(results)

def perform_backtest(strategy):
    # This function should perform the backtest and return the results
    # For now, it just returns an empty list
    return []

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement the fallback strategy
    # For now, it just prints a message
    print("Fallback strategy implemented.")

def process_results(results):
    # This function should process the backtest results
    # For now, it just prints a message
    print("Processing backtest results.")

# Test the function with a strategy
backtest_strategy("Strategy 1")
```

In this code, the `backtest_strategy` function calls `perform_backtest` to get the backtest results. If no results are found (i.e., the results are empty), it calls `fallback_strategy`. If results are found, it calls `process_results` to process them. 

Please note that this is a simple example and the actual implementation would depend on the specifics of your trading system and the backtesting and fallback strategies you want to use.
