To analyze market trends and identify potential trading opportunities, we can use Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download the stock data, and matplotlib to visualize the data. 

Here is a simple Python script that uses Moving Average Crossover Strategy to identify potential trading opportunities:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
def download_data(stock, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31'):
    data = yf.download(stock, start, end)
    return data

# Calculate moving averages
def calculate_MA(data, short_window=20, long_window=100):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Short moving average
    signals['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Long moving average
    signals['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                                > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Plot the data
def plot_data(data, signals):
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111, ylabel='Price in $')
    data['Close'].plot(ax=ax1, color='r', lw=2.)
    signals[['short_mavg', 'long_mavg']].plot(ax=ax1, lw=2.)

    # Plot the buy signals
    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == 1.0].index, 
             signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == 1.0],
             '^', markersize=10, color='m')
    
    # Plot the sell signals
    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == -1.0].index, 
             signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == -1.0],
             'v', markersize=10, color='k')
    
    plt.show()

# Define the stock symbol and download the data
stock = 'AAPL'
data = download_data(stock)

# Calculate the moving averages and generate signals
signals = calculate_MA(data)

# Plot the data along with the moving averages and signals
plot_data(data, signals)
```

Please note that this is a basic example and real-world trading involves much more complexity. Also, this script assumes that you have installed the necessary Python libraries (pandas, yfinance, matplotlib).
