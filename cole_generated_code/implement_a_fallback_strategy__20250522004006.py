Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that returns backtest results and a function `fallback_strategy()` that you want to run when no backtest results are found.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    # Run the backtest
    results = run_backtest()

    # Check if results are empty or None
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
        # Run the fallback strategy
        results = fallback_strategy()

    return results

def run_backtest():
    # This is a placeholder for your actual backtest function
    # It should return the results of the backtest
    # For now, it returns None to simulate no backtest results found
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your actual fallback strategy function
    # It should return the results of the fallback strategy
    # For now, it returns a simple message
    return "Fallback strategy results"

# Test the function
print(get_backtest_results())
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results()` is the main function you would call to get backtest results. It first tries to run the backtest using `run_backtest()`. If no results are found (i.e., `results` is `None` or empty), it then runs the fallback strategy using `fallback_strategy()`.
