Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This example assumes that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that returns the results of a backtest. If no results are found, it returns `None`. 

In this fallback strategy, if no backtest results are found, we will run a different function called `run_fallback_strategy()`.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    pass

def run_fallback_strategy():
    # Your fallback strategy code here
    pass

def execute_strategy():
    backtest_results = run_backtest()
    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
        fallback_results = run_fallback_strategy()
        return fallback_results
    else:
        return backtest_results

# Execute the strategy
results = execute_strategy()
```

Please replace the `run_backtest()` and `run_fallback_strategy()` functions with your actual backtest and fallback strategy functions. The `execute_strategy()` function will run the backtest and return its results if they exist. If not, it will run the fallback strategy and return its results.
