Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple Python code snippet that uses the `pandas` library to calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and identify crossovers. This code assumes that you have a DataFrame called `df` that contains your trading data, with 'Close' prices.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assuming df is your DataFrame and it has 'Close' prices.

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def ema_crossover(data, short_window, long_window):
    # Calculate short and long EMA
    short_ema = calculate_ema(data['Close'], short_window)
    long_ema = calculate_ema(data['Close'], long_window)

    # Create signals
    data['short_ema'] = short_ema
    data['long_ema'] = long_ema
    data['signal'] = 0.0
    data['signal'][short_ema > long_ema] = 1.0
    data['crossover'] = data['signal'].diff()

    return data

# Define the EMA windows as per your trading strategy
short_window = 12
long_window = 26

# Calculate EMA crossover
df = ema_crossover(df, short_window, long_window)

# Print data where crossover occurred
print(df[df['crossover'] != 0])
```

In this code, `short_ema` and `long_ema` are the short and long term EMAs respectively. The 'signal' column in the DataFrame is used to identify where the EMA crossover occurs. A signal of '1.0' means the short EMA is above the long EMA (which is typically considered a buy signal), and a signal of '0.0' means the short EMA is below the long EMA (which is typically considered a sell signal). The 'crossover' column is the difference between the current and previous signal, and is used to identify the points where a crossover occurs.
