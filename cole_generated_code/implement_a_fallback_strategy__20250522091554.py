Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, I'm assuming that you have a function `run_backtest()` that returns backtest results, and a function `run_fallback()` that will be used when no backtest results are found.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")
        results = run_fallback()
    return results

def run_backtest():
    # Your code to run backtest here
    # Return the results, or None if no results are found
    pass

def run_fallback():
    # Your code to run fallback strategy here
    # Return the results
    pass
```

You would call `get_backtest_results()` to get the backtest results, and it would automatically run the fallback strategy if no backtest results are found.

Please replace the `run_backtest()` and `run_fallback()` functions with your actual backtest and fallback strategy code.
