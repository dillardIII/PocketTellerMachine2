Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. 

```python
def backtest_strategy(data):
    # Assume that 'run_backtest' is a function that runs the backtest and returns the results
    backtest_results = run_backtest(data)

    if not backtest_results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy...")
        # Assume that 'run_fallback_strategy' is a function that runs the fallback strategy
        fallback_results = run_fallback_strategy(data)
        return fallback_results

    return backtest_results
```

In this function, we first run the backtest using the provided data. If no results are found (i.e., `backtest_results` is `None` or an empty list), we print a message and then run the fallback strategy. The results of the fallback strategy are then returned. If backtest results are found, they are returned immediately.

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In a real-world scenario, the `run_backtest` and `run_fallback_strategy` functions would likely be more complex and might involve additional parameters. Also, the way we check for "no results" might vary depending on how `run_backtest` indicates that no results were found.
