To analyze market trends and patterns, we need to use some sort of data analysis. Python has a library called pandas that is great for this kind of task. We also need data to analyze. There are many sources of market data, but for this example, we'll use Yahoo Finance, which we can access using the yfinance library.

Here's a simple example of how you might start to analyze market trends and patterns:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'
tickerData = yf.Ticker(ticker)
df = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# Plot the closing price
df['Close'].plot(figsize=(10, 7), grid=True)
plt.title(f'{ticker} Closing Price Over Time')
plt.show()

# Analyze trend using linear regression
df['Days From Start'] = range(1, len(df) + 1)
X = df['Days From Start'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = df['Close'].values.reshape(-1,1)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)
regressor = LinearRegression()  
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# To retrieve the intercept and slope:
print('Intercept (starting price):', regressor.intercept_)
print('Slope (price change per day):', regressor.coef_)

# Plotting the regression line
line = regressor.coef_*X+regressor.intercept_
plt.scatter(X, y, color='gray')
plt.plot(X, line, color='red', linewidth=2)
plt.show()
```

This code will plot the closing price of a stock (in this case, Apple) over time, and then fit a linear regression to the data to analyze the trend. The intercept of the regression is the starting price, and the slope is the price change per day.

Please note that this is a very simple example and real trading algorithms would be much more complex, taking into account many more factors. Also, this code does not identify trading opportunities, it just analyzes the overall trend. Identifying trading opportunities would require more complex analysis and likely use of machine learning algorithms.
