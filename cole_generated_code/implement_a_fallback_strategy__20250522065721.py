Here's a simple example of how you could implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the code will print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume we have a function 'run_backtest' that runs the backtest and returns a dictionary of results
    results = run_backtest(strategy)

    # If results is empty, print a message and return an empty dictionary as a fallback
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        return {}

    # If results were found, return them
    return results

def run_backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder function. In a real scenario, this function would run the backtest and return the results.
    # For now, it just returns an empty dictionary to simulate a scenario where no backtest results are found.
    return {}
```

Please replace the `run_backtest` function with your actual backtest function. The `backtest_strategy` function checks if the result is empty and implements the fallback strategy if it is. In this case, the fallback strategy is simply returning an empty dictionary, but you could replace this with whatever fallback behavior is appropriate for your application.
