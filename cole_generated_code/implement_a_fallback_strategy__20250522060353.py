Sure, I can provide you with a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, I'll assume that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that returns the results of a backtest, and that this function returns `None` if no results are found.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This is a placeholder for your actual backtest function
    # It should return the results of the backtest, or None if no results were found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your fallback strategy
    # It should be implemented to do something useful when no backtest results are found
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")

# Run the backtest
results = run_backtest()

# If no results were found, run the fallback strategy
if results is None:
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    print("Backtest results found:", results)
```

In this example, the fallback strategy is simply to print a message to the console. You would need to replace the `fallback_strategy()` function with your actual fallback strategy. This could be anything from running a different type of backtest, to using a default set of trading parameters, to simply notifying the user that no results were found.
