Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the program will print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume we have a function `run_backtest` that runs the backtest and returns a dictionary of results
    results = run_backtest(strategy)

    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Falling back to default strategy.")
        # Fallback strategy can be implemented here. For now, return an empty dictionary.
        return {}

    return results
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the fallback strategy would depend on the specifics of your trading system. It could involve running a different strategy, using default values, or even raising an exception.
