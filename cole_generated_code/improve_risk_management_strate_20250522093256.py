Risk management in trading involves several strategies which include setting stop losses, diversifying portfolio, position sizing, etc. Here's a simple Python code that demonstrates a risk management strategy by setting a stop loss limit.

```python
class RiskManagement:
    def __init__(self, initial_investment, stop_loss_limit):
        self.initial_investment = initial_investment
        self.stop_loss_limit = stop_loss_limit
        self.current_investment = initial_investment

    def update_investment(self, new_value):
        self.current_investment = new_value
        self.check_stop_loss()

    def check_stop_loss(self):
        if self.current_investment <= self.initial_investment * self.stop_loss_limit:
            print("Stop loss limit reached. Sell all assets.")
            self.sell_all()

    def sell_all(self):
        print("Selling all assets...")
        self.current_investment = 0

# Usage
risk_manager = RiskManagement(10000, 0.9)  # initial investment is 10000, stop loss limit is 90%
risk_manager.update_investment(9000)  # if the current investment value drops to 9000, it triggers the stop loss
```

This is a very basic example and real-world trading risk management would involve more complex strategies and would take into account more factors. Also, this code doesn't actually perform any trading actions, it just simulates the logic behind a stop loss strategy. In a real-world application, the `sell_all` method would need to interface with a trading API to actually perform the sell action.

Please note that this code is a simple example and does not guarantee prevention of potential losses. Always consult with a financial advisor or use professional trading platforms for actual trading.
