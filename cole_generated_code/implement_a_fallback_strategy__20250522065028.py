Sure, here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function called `run_backtest()` which returns the backtest results. If no results are found, the fallback strategy is executed.

```python
def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
    # Implement your fallback strategy here

def main():
    backtest_results = run_backtest()

    if not backtest_results:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")
        # Process backtest results here

def run_backtest():
    # This function should return backtest results
    # For now, it returns None to simulate no results found
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` is a placeholder function that currently returns `None`. You should replace this function with your actual backtesting function. The `fallback_strategy()` function is where you should implement your fallback strategy. Right now, it just prints a message, but you can replace this with any code you want to execute when no backtest results are found.
