In order to engage in trading, we would need to use an API that allows us to buy and sell stocks. One such API is Alpaca, which is a commission-free trading platform that allows for algorithmic trading.

Here is a simple example of how you might use the Alpaca API to engage in trading. This example will buy a stock when its price is low and sell it when its price is high.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading involves a lot more complexity and risk. You should only trade with money that you can afford to lose and you should always do your own research before making any trades.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

def trade(symbol, qty):
    # Get the current price of the stock
    current_price = api.get_last_trade(symbol).price

    # Define the high and low prices for the stock
    high_price = 100
    low_price = 50

    # If the current price is lower than the low price, buy the stock
    if current_price < low_price:
        api.submit_order(
            symbol=symbol,
            qty=qty,
            side='buy',
            type='market',
            time_in_force='gtc'
        )
        print(f"Bought {qty} shares of {symbol}")

    # If the current price is higher than the high price, sell the stock
    elif current_price > high_price:
        api.submit_order(
            symbol=symbol,
            qty=qty,
            side='sell',
            type='market',
            time_in_force='gtc'
        )
        print(f"Sold {qty} shares of {symbol}")

# Call the trade function for a specific stock
trade('AAPL', 1)
```

Please replace '<APCA-API-KEY-ID>' and '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>' with your Alpaca API key ID and secret key.

This script will check the current price of a specific stock (in this case, AAPL). If the price is below $50, it will buy 1 share. If the price is above $100, it will sell 1 share.
