Sure, here is a simple Python code that uses the `pandas` library to calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and analyze the crossover points. 

This code assumes that you have a `pandas` DataFrame `df` with a `Close` column for closing prices. It calculates the EMA for two different periods (short-term and long-term), and then finds the points where the short-term EMA crosses above or below the long-term EMA.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def analyze_crossovers(data, short_window, long_window):
    # Calculate short and long EMA
    data['Short_EMA'] = calculate_ema(data['Close'], short_window)
    data['Long_EMA'] = calculate_ema(data['Close'], long_window)

    # Create column for the difference between short and long EMA
    data['EMA_Diff'] = data['Short_EMA'] - data['Long_EMA']

    # Create column for the sign of the difference
    data['Sign'] = np.sign(data['EMA_Diff'])

    # Find crossover points
    data['Crossover'] = np.where(data['Sign'].diff() != 0, data['Close'], np.nan)

    return data

# Define short and long EMA windows
short_window = 12
long_window = 26

# Assume df is your DataFrame with a 'Close' column for closing prices
df = analyze_crossovers(df, short_window, long_window)

# Print DataFrame
print(df)
```

Please note that you need to replace `df` with your actual DataFrame. Also, you can adjust the `short_window` and `long_window` variables to the periods you want to use for the short-term and long-term EMA, respectively. The `Crossover` column in the resulting DataFrame will contain the closing price at the points where a crossover occurs, and `NaN` otherwise.
