As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I can provide you with a Python code template for investigating potential reasons for inactivity. However, without specific details about your trading system, it's challenging to provide a precise solution. Here's a general approach:

```python
import logging
from datetime import datetime
from trading_system import TradingSystem # This is a placeholder for your actual trading system

def check_inactivity():
    try:
        # Initialize trading system
        trading_system = TradingSystem()

        # Check if the trading system is active
        if not trading_system.is_active():
            logging.error('Trading system is inactive.')
            return

        # Check if the market is open
        if not trading_system.is_market_open():
            logging.info('Market is currently closed.')
            return

        # Check if there are any technical issues
        if trading_system.has_technical_issues():
            logging.error('Trading system has technical issues.')
            # Here you can add code to resolve technical issues
            return

        # Check if there are any strategic issues
        if trading_system.has_strategic_issues():
            logging.error('Trading system has strategic issues.')
            # Here you can add code to resolve strategic issues
            return

        logging.info('No inactivity issues detected.')

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f'An error occurred: {e}')

# Run the function
check_inactivity()
```

This script logs different messages based on the status of the trading system. If the system is inactive, it logs an error message. If the market is closed, it logs an informational message. If there are technical or strategic issues, it logs an error message.

Please replace the `TradingSystem` placeholder and its methods with your actual trading system and its methods. Also, you might need to add specific code to resolve technical or strategic issues based on your system's requirements.
