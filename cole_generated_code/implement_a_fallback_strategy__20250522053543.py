Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the program will print a message and then execute some fallback code.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This function is a placeholder and should be replaced with your actual backtesting logic
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function is a placeholder and should be replaced with your actual fallback strategy
    print("Executing fallback strategy...")

def main():
    strategy = "My Trading Strategy"
    backtest_results = backtest(strategy)

    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found for strategy: " + strategy)
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found:")
        print(backtest_results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, `backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` are placeholder functions. You would need to replace them with your actual backtesting logic and fallback strategy. The `main()` function calls `backtest()` with a strategy, checks if the result is `None`, and if so, calls `fallback_strategy()`. Otherwise, it prints the backtest results.
