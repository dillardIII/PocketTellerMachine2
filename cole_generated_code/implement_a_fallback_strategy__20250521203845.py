Sure, here is a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the fallback strategy is to simply print a message and return an empty list.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume we have a function get_backtest_results that returns backtest results
    results = get_backtest_results(strategy)

    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        return []

    return results

def get_backtest_results(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder function. In real code, you would replace this with actual code to get backtest results.
    return []

strategy = "My Trading Strategy"
backtest_strategy(strategy)
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results` is a placeholder function that always returns an empty list. In your real code, you would replace this with your actual function to get backtest results.

The `backtest_strategy` function checks if the results are empty. If they are, it prints a message and returns an empty list as the fallback strategy. If results are found, it simply returns the results.

Please replace the placeholder function with your actual function to get backtest results. The fallback strategy can also be modified according to your needs.
