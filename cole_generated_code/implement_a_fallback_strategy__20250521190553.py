Sure, I will write a Python function that simulates a backtest. If no results are found, the function will implement a fallback strategy.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # Simulate backtest
    try:
        results = strategy.run_backtest()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Backtest failed: {e}")
        results = None

    # Check if results are found
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        fallback_strategy = FallbackStrategy()
        try:
            results = fallback_strategy.run_backtest()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Fallback strategy failed: {e}")
            results = None

    return results
```

In this code, `strategy` and `FallbackStrategy` are placeholders for your actual strategy and fallback strategy objects. The `run_backtest` method is also a placeholder for the method you would use to run your backtest.

Please replace these placeholders with your actual objects and methods. If an error occurs during the backtest, the function will catch the exception, print an error message, and return `None`. If no results are found from the initial strategy, the function will implement a fallback strategy. If the fallback strategy also fails, the function will print an error message and return `None`.
