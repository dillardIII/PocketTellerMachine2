Sure, here is a simple Python code example that simulates a trading strategy. This strategy is based on moving averages, a common indicator in technical analysis. The strategy is to buy when the short-term average crosses the long-term average from below and sell when it crosses from above.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.buy_signals = []
        self.sell_signals = []

    def calculate_moving_average(self, window):
        return self.data.rolling(window).mean()

    def implement_strategy(self, short_window, long_window):
        short_avg = self.calculate_moving_average(short_window)
        long_avg = self.calculate_moving_average(long_window)

        for i in range(1, len(self.data)):
            if short_avg[i] > long_avg[i] and short_avg[i-1] < long_avg[i-1]:
                self.buy_signals.append(self.data[i])
            elif short_avg[i] < long_avg[i] and short_avg[i-1] > long_avg[i-1]:
                self.sell_signals.append(self.data[i])

        return self.buy_signals, self.sell_signals

    def test_strategy(self):
        buy_signals, sell_signals = self.implement_strategy(50, 200)
        total_trades = len(buy_signals) + len(sell_signals)
        print(f"Total trades: {total_trades}")

# Simulate some price data
np.random.seed(0)
price_data = pd.Series(np.random.randn(1000), index=pd.date_range(start='1/1/2020', periods=1000))

ptm = PTM(price_data)
ptm.test_strategy()
```

This code creates a class `PTM` for the trading model. It calculates moving averages for given windows of time, implements the trading strategy, and tests it by counting the total number of trades.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world trading strategies are much more complex and take many more factors into account. Also, this code doesn't include any risk management or portfolio optimization, which are crucial parts of a real trading system.
