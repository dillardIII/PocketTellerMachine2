Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trading bot. This bot will initiate at least one trade to increase the potential for wins. Please note that this is a simulation and should not be used for actual trading.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance
        self.stock = 0

    def trade(self):
        # Randomly decide whether to buy or sell
        action = random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])

        if action == 'buy':
            # Randomly decide how many stocks to buy
            quantity = random.randint(1, 10)
            price = random.uniform(1.0, 10.0)

            if self.balance >= price * quantity:
                self.balance -= price * quantity
                self.stock += quantity
                print(f"PTM bought {quantity} stocks at a price of {price} each.")
            else:
                print("PTM doesn't have enough balance to buy stocks.")
        else:
            # Randomly decide how many stocks to sell
            quantity = random.randint(1, self.stock)

            if self.stock >= quantity:
                price = random.uniform(1.0, 10.0)
                self.balance += price * quantity
                self.stock -= quantity
                print(f"PTM sold {quantity} stocks at a price of {price} each.")
            else:
                print("PTM doesn't have any stocks to sell.")

        print(f"PTM's current balance is {self.balance} and it has {self.stock} stocks.")

# Initialize PTM with a balance of 1000
ptm = PTM(1000)

# PTM initiates a trade
ptm.trade()
```

This code creates a simple trading bot that randomly decides whether to buy or sell stocks. The bot starts with a balance of 1000 and can buy or sell between 1 and 10 stocks at a time. The price of each stock is also randomly decided between 1.0 and 10.0. The bot will only buy stocks if it has enough balance and will only sell stocks if it has any. After each trade, the bot's current balance and the number of stocks it has are printed.
