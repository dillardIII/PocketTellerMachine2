Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found.

```python
def backtest_strategy():
    # Assume this function performs the backtest and returns the results
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is the fallback strategy when no backtest results are found
    print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy...")

# Main function
def main():
    backtest_results = backtest_strategy()

    if not backtest_results:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found. Proceeding with the strategy...")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, we first try to get the backtest results by calling the `backtest_strategy` function. If no results are found (i.e., `backtest_results` is `None` or empty), we call the `fallback_strategy` function. If results are found, we proceed with the strategy.

Please note that this is a very basic example. In a real-world scenario, the `backtest_strategy` and `fallback_strategy` functions would contain the actual logic for the backtest and fallback strategies, respectively.
