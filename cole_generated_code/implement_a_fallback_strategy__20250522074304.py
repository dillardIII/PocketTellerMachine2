Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This example assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that returns the results of a backtest, and `fallback_strategy()` that should be executed when no backtest results are found.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your fallback strategy here
    pass

def execute_strategy():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None or len(results) == 0:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found. Proceeding as normal.")
        # Your code to handle backtest results here

execute_strategy()
```

This is a very basic example. Depending on your specific needs, you might want to add more complex error handling, logging, etc.
