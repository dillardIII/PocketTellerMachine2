To analyze market trends and data to identify potential winning trades, you would typically use a combination of data analysis libraries in Python such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for visualization. You would also need to use a financial data source, such as Yahoo Finance, which can be accessed using the yfinance library.

Here is a simple example of how you might implement this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = "AAPL"
tickerData = yf.Ticker(ticker)
df = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# Calculate moving average
df['MA_50'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
df['MA_200'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Create a 'signal' (invested or not invested)
df['signal'] = np.where(df['MA_50'] > df['MA_200'], 1.0, 0.0)

# Generate trading orders
df['positions'] = df['signal'].diff()

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
plt.plot(df['Close'], label=ticker)
plt.plot(df['MA_50'], label='MA 50')
plt.plot(df['MA_200'], label='MA 200')
plt.plot(df.loc[df.positions == 1.0].index, 
         df['MA_50'][df.positions == 1.0],
         '^', markersize=10, color='m', label='buy')
plt.plot(df.loc[df.positions == -1.0].index, 
         df['MA_50'][df.positions == -1.0],
         'v', markersize=10, color='k', label='sell')
plt.ylabel('Price in $')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.grid()
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This script downloads historical data for the Apple stock, calculates two moving averages (50 days and 200 days), and generates a trading signal whenever the short moving average crosses the long moving average. It then plots the stock price, the moving averages, and the trading signals.

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and is not guaranteed to make a profit. It is always recommended to use more sophisticated methods and to thoroughly backtest any strategy before live trading.
