Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs the backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, the fallback strategy is executed.

```python
def fallback_strategy():
    # Implement your fallback strategy here
    print("Running fallback strategy...")

def main():
    backtest_results = run_backtest()

    if not backtest_results:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Process backtest results
        print("Processing backtest results...")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` is a placeholder for your actual backtest function. You would need to replace `fallback_strategy()` with the actual code for your fallback strategy. The `main()` function runs the backtest and checks if any results were returned. If no results were returned, it runs the fallback strategy. Otherwise, it processes the backtest results.

Please replace the placeholder functions with your actual implementation.
