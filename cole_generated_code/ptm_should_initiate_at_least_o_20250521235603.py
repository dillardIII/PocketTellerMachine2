Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. Please note that this is a very basic example and doesn't include any trading strategy. The strategy should be developed based on the specific requirements and market conditions.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # initial balance
        self.stock_price = 100  # initial stock price

    def trade(self):
        # Randomly decide to buy or sell
        action = random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])

        if action == 'buy':
            # Buy 1 stock if there is enough balance
            if self.balance >= self.stock_price:
                self.balance -= self.stock_price
                print(f'Bought 1 stock for {self.stock_price}. Remaining balance: {self.balance}')
            else:
                print('Not enough balance to buy')
        else:
            # Sell 1 stock (assume we have at least 1 stock)
            self.balance += self.stock_price
            print(f'Sold 1 stock for {self.stock_price}. Remaining balance: {self.balance}')

        # Randomly change the stock price
        self.stock_price += random.randint(-10, 10)

ptm = PTM()
ptm.trade()  # Initiate a trade
```

This code creates a PTM (Portfolio Trading Model) class with an initial balance and stock price. The `trade` method randomly decides to buy or sell a stock. If the action is 'buy' and there is enough balance, it buys 1 stock. If the action is 'sell', it sells 1 stock. After each trade, the stock price randomly changes. The `trade` method is then called to initiate a trade.

Please note that this is a very simplified model and doesn't reflect the complexity of real-world trading. In a real trading system, you would need to consider many other factors such as transaction fees, multiple stocks, historical data, trading strategy, risk management, etc.
