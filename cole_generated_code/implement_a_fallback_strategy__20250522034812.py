Sure, I'll write a Python function that simulates a backtest and implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. The fallback strategy could be to return a default result or to raise an exception.

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # Simulate backtest
    results = None
    try:
        results = strategy.run_backtest()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error running backtest: {e}")

    # Fallback strategy
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Here you can define your fallback strategy. 
        # For example, you can return a default result or raise an exception.
        results = "Default Result"
        # raise Exception("No backtest results found.")
        
    return results

# Define your strategy here
class Strategy:
    def run_backtest(self):
        # Simulate running a backtest
        return None

strategy = Strategy()
print(backtest(strategy))
```

In this code, `Strategy` is a placeholder for your actual trading strategy. The `run_backtest` method should be implemented to run the backtest and return the results. If no results are found (i.e., `run_backtest` returns `None`), the fallback strategy is implemented. In this example, the fallback strategy is to return a default result, but you can modify this to suit your needs.
