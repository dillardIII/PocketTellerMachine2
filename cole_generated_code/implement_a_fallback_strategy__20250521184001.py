Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def get_backtest_results(backtest_id):
    # This is a placeholder for the actual code that retrieves backtest results.
    # It should return a dictionary with backtest results if they are found.
    backtest_results = {}

    # Check if backtest results were found.
    if not backtest_results:
        # Fallback strategy: print a message and return an empty dictionary.
        print(f"No backtest results found for ID: {backtest_id}. Please check the backtest ID and try again.")
        return {}

    # If backtest results were found, return them.
    return backtest_results

# Test the function with a backtest ID that doesn't have results.
print(get_backtest_results("invalid_backtest_id"))
```

This is a very basic fallback strategy. Depending on your specific needs, you might want to implement a more complex strategy, such as retrying the backtest, using cached results, or raising an exception.
