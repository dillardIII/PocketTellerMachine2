To analyze the EMA (Exponential Moving Average) Crossover, we need to calculate the EMA for two different periods, typically a short period and a longer period. Let's say we will use the 9-day and 21-day periods, which are common in trend analysis. Then we will determine the points where the short period EMA crosses the long period EMA. 

Here's a possible Python script using Pandas for this task:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_EMA(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def EMA_crossover(df, short_window, long_window):
    # Calculate the short and long period EMAs
    df['Short_EMA'] = calculate_EMA(df['Close'], short_window)
    df['Long_EMA'] = calculate_EMA(df['Close'], long_window)
    
    # Create signals based on crossover
    df['Signal'] = 0.0  
    df['Signal'][short_window:] = np.where(df['Short_EMA'][short_window:] > df['Long_EMA'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
    df['Position'] = df['Signal'].diff()
    
    # Print the signals 
    print(df[df['Position'] == 1])
    print(df[df['Position'] == -1])

# Get the data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')
EMA_crossover(data, 9, 21)
```
Note: We assume that we're analyzing Apple Inc.'s stock prices (AAPL) from 2020-01-01 to 2022-12-31.

You will need to have the `pandas` , `numpy` and `yfinance` libraries installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy yfinance
```

In this script, when the Position column is 1, it means that the short period EMA has crossed the long period EMA in upward direction, which is considered a bullish signal. When it is -1, the short period EMA has crossed the long period EMA in downward direction, which traders take as a bearish signal.
