Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the program will print a message and then execute the fallback strategy.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume this function backtests a strategy and returns the results
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is your fallback strategy
    print("Executing fallback strategy...")
    # Add your fallback strategy code here

def main():
    strategy = "Your trading strategy"

    backtest_results = backtest_strategy(strategy)

    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")
        # Process the backtest results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This is a simple example and you might need to modify it to fit your specific needs. For instance, you might want to return some value from the fallback_strategy function, or you might want to handle exceptions that could be raised during the backtesting or the fallback strategy.
