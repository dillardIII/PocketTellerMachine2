Sure, here is a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that runs a backtest and returns its results. If no results are found, it will run a fallback strategy.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function should run the backtest and return the results
    # For the purpose of this example, it returns None
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement the fallback strategy
    print("Running fallback strategy...")

def main():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")
        # Process the results here

main()
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` is a placeholder for your actual backtesting function. If this function returns `None` (indicating that no backtest results were found), the `fallback_strategy()` function is called. You should replace this function with your actual fallback strategy.

Please replace the placeholder functions with your actual functions to make this code work in your context.
