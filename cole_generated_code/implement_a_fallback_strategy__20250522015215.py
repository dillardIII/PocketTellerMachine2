Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found.

```python
class TradingAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.backtest_results = None

    def run_backtest(self):
        # Code to run backtest here
        # This should update self.backtest_results

        pass

    def fallback_strategy(self):
        # Fallback strategy implementation here
        print("Running fallback strategy...")

    def execute_strategy(self):
        if self.backtest_results is None:
            self.fallback_strategy()
        else:
            # Code to execute main strategy based on backtest results
            pass

# Usage
assistant = TradingAssistant()
assistant.run_backtest()
assistant.execute_strategy()
```

In this code, `run_backtest` is a placeholder for the method that would run the backtest and update `self.backtest_results`. If `self.backtest_results` is `None` when `execute_strategy` is called, it means no backtest results were found, and the fallback strategy is executed instead.
