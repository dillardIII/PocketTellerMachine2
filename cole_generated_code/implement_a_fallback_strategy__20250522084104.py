Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This example assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs a backtest and returns the results, or `None` if no results are found.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function should run the backtest and return the results, or None if no results are found.
    # For the sake of this example, let's assume that it just returns None.
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement your fallback strategy.
    # For the sake of this example, let's just print a message.
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")

# Run the backtest.
backtest_results = run_backtest()

# If no results are found, run the fallback strategy.
if backtest_results is None:
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    print("Backtest results found:", backtest_results)
```

In this example, if `run_backtest()` returns `None`, the `fallback_strategy()` function is called. You would need to replace these functions with your actual backtest and fallback strategy implementations.
