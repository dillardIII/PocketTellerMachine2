Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that returns backtest results, and a function `run_fallback()` that should be run if no backtest results are found.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    results = run_backtest()

    # If no results are found, run the fallback strategy
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
        results = run_fallback()

    return results

def run_backtest():
    # Your code to run the backtest goes here
    # For now, let's just return None to simulate no results being found
    return None

def run_fallback():
    # Your code for the fallback strategy goes here
    # For now, let's just return a simple message
    return "Fallback strategy results"

# Test the function
print(get_backtest_results())
```

In this example, `run_backtest()` always returns `None`, simulating a situation where no backtest results are found. In this case, `get_backtest_results()` will run the fallback strategy by calling `run_fallback()`. You would replace these functions with your actual backtesting and fallback strategy code.
