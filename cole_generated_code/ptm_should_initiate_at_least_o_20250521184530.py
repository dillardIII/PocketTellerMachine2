Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that simulates a trading operation. This code doesn't actually perform any real trades, it's just a simulation. For real trading, you would need to use a trading API.

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 1000.0
        self.trades = []

    def initiate_trade(self, trade):
        if self.balance > trade.price:
            self.trades.append(trade)
            self.balance -= trade.price
            print(f"Trade initiated: Bought {trade.name} for {trade.price}")
        else:
            print(f"Insufficient balance to initiate trade for {trade.name}")

    def calculate_profit_or_loss(self):
        market_price = random.uniform(50, 150)  # This is a simulation. In real trading, you would get this from the market data.
        for trade in self.trades:
            if market_price > trade.price:
                print(f"Profit for {trade.name}: {market_price - trade.price}")
            else:
                print(f"Loss for {trade.name}: {trade.price - market_price}")

ptm = PTM()
trade = Trade("Apple", 100.0)
ptm.initiate_trade(trade)
ptm.calculate_profit_or_loss()
```

This code initiates a trade if there is sufficient balance. It then calculates the profit or loss based on a simulated market price. In a real trading application, you would get the market price from real-time market data.
