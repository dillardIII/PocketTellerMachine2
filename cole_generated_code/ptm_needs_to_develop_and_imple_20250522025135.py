Sure, I can help with that. However, developing trading strategies is a complex task and requires a deep understanding of financial markets. Here is a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic moving average crossover strategy using the pandas library. This strategy is not guaranteed to be profitable and is just for illustrative purposes.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = "AAPL"
data = yf.download(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2021-12-31")

# Calculate moving averages
short_window = 40
long_window = 100

signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
signals['signal'] = 0.0

# Short moving average
signals['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

# Long moving average
signals['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

# Create signals
signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                            > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   

# Generate trading orders
signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

# Print `signals`
print(signals)
```

This script downloads historical data for a given ticker symbol (in this case, AAPL) and calculates short-term (40 days) and long-term (100 days) moving averages. When the short-term average is above the long-term average, the strategy generates a "buy" signal (1.0), and when it's below, it generates a "sell" signal (0.0). The 'positions' column shows the trading orders: a positive value indicates a buy order and a negative value indicates a sell order.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and doesn't take into account transaction costs, slippage, risk management, etc. It's highly recommended to use more sophisticated strategies and risk management techniques for actual trading.
