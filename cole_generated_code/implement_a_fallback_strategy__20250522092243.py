Sure, here's a simple way to implement a fallback strategy using Python. The fallback strategy could be anything, but for this example, let's assume that we will just print a message and return an empty list.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume we have a function get_backtest_results that returns backtest results
    results = get_backtest_results(strategy)
    
    # If no results are found
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        
        # Fallback strategy: return an empty list
        return []
    
    # If results are found, return them
    return results
```

In this code, we first try to get backtest results for a given strategy. If no results are found (i.e., `results` is an empty list or None), we print a message and return an empty list as a fallback. If results are found, we return them.

Please replace `get_backtest_results` with your actual function to get backtest results. The fallback strategy can also be modified according to your needs.
