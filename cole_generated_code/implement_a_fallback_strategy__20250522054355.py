Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This is a general example and may need to be adjusted based on the specifics of your trading system.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    """
    Function to backtest a given strategy.
    """
    # Your backtest code here
    # ...

def fallback_strategy():
    """
    """
    # Your fallback strategy here
    # ...

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    """
    Function to execute a given strategy.
    """
    try:
        backtest_results = backtest_strategy(strategy)
        if not backtest_results:
            print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
            fallback_strategy()
        else:
            # Execute the strategy
            # ...
            pass
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
        print("Executing fallback strategy...")
        fallback_strategy()

# Example usage
execute_strategy(my_strategy)
```

In this code, `execute_strategy` function is trying to backtest a given strategy. If no backtest results are found (i.e., `backtest_results` is empty), it executes the fallback strategy. If an error occurs during the backtesting, it also executes the fallback strategy.
