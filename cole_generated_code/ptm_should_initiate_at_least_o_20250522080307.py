To initiate a trade, we need to interact with a trading API. Here's an example of how you might do this using the Alpaca API, a popular choice for algorithmic trading. 

First, you'll need to install the Alpaca API. You can do this using pip:

```python
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Then, you can use the following code to initiate a trade:

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Replace these with your API connection info from the dashboard
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock at the current market price. The order is a 'good till cancelled' (gtc) order, which means it will stay active until it's either filled or cancelled.

Please replace '<APCA-API-KEY-ID>' and '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>' with your actual Alpaca API key ID and secret key.

Note: This is a paper trading API endpoint, so it won't actually buy any real stocks, it's just for testing and development. For live trading, you would need to use the live trading endpoint and ensure you have sufficient funds in your account.

Also, this is a simple example. In a real-world application, you would want to add error handling and possibly more complex order logic.
