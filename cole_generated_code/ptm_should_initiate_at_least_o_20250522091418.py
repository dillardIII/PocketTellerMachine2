Sure, here is a simple Python code that uses the Alpaca API to initiate a trade. Please replace the placeholders with your actual API keys.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Define your API keys
API_KEY = '<Your-API-Key>'
API_SECRET = '<Your-API-Secret>'
BASE_URL = 'https://paper-api.alpaca.markets'  # Use paper trading URL for testing

# Create an API object
api = tradeapi.REST(API_KEY, API_SECRET, base_url=BASE_URL)

# Define the symbol and quantity for the trade
symbol = 'AAPL'  # Apple Inc.
qty = 1  # Number of shares

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock
order = api.submit_order(
    symbol=symbol,
    qty=qty,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)

print(f"Submitted order to buy {qty} share(s) of {symbol}")
```

This script will submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple Inc. (AAPL) using the Alpaca paper trading API, which simulates trading with fake money. This is a great way to gain practical market insights without risking real money.

Please note that you need to have an Alpaca account and your API keys to run this script. Also, remember to install the Alpaca API Python client (`alpaca-trade-api`) if you haven't done so already. You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Please also note that trading involves risk, and this code is provided as an example. You should understand what this code does before running it.
