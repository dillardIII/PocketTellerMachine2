Sure, here is a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found.

```python
def backtest_strategy(data):
    try:
        # Assume backtest() is a function that performs backtesting and returns results
        results = backtest(data)
        
        if not results:
            raise ValueError("No backtest results found.")
            
        return results
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
        # Fallback strategy: return a default value or perform some other action
        return {"status": "No results, fallback to default strategy", "data": data}
```

In this code, we first try to perform a backtest using the `backtest()` function (which is not defined here, it's just an example). If the `backtest()` function returns no results (an empty list, None, etc.), we raise a `ValueError`.

In the `except` block, we catch this `ValueError` and print its message. Then, we implement our fallback strategy. In this case, the fallback strategy is to return a dictionary with a status message and the original data. You can replace this with whatever fallback strategy you want to use.
