Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the fallback strategy is to return a message notifying the user.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume we have a function `run_backtest` that returns backtest results
    results = run_backtest(strategy)

    if not results:
        # Fallback strategy: Return a message notifying the user
        return "No backtest results found. Please check your strategy and try again."
    else:
        return results

# Example usage
strategy = "My Trading Strategy"
print(backtest_strategy(strategy))
```

Please replace `run_backtest` with your actual backtesting function. The `strategy` argument should also be replaced with the actual strategy you're using for backtesting. 

This is a very basic fallback strategy. Depending on your needs, you might want to implement more complex fallback strategies. For example, you could try a different strategy if the first one fails, or you could retry the backtest after waiting for some time.
