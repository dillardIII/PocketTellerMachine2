Sure, here's a simple way to implement a fallback strategy using Python. In this example, we will assume that the `backtest()` function is used to perform the backtest and it returns `None` if no results are found. The fallback strategy will be to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def perform_backtest():
    result = backtest()  # Assume this function performs the backtest

    # Check if the result is None
    if result is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # The fallback strategy in this case is to return an empty dictionary
        result = {}

    return result
```

You can replace the print statement and the empty dictionary with any other fallback strategy you want to implement.
