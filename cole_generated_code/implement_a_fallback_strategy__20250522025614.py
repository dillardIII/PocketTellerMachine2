Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. 

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    try:
        # Assume that this function performs the backtest and returns the results
        results = perform_backtest(strategy)
        
        # If no results are found, raise an exception
        if not results:
            raise Exception('No backtest results found')
            
        return results
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'Error: {e}')
        
        # Fallback strategy
        print('Applying fallback strategy...')
        fallback_results = perform_backtest('fallback_strategy')
        
        return fallback_results
```

In this code, we first try to perform the backtest with the given strategy. If no results are found (i.e., if `results` is `None` or an empty list), we raise an exception. In the `except` block, we catch this exception, print an error message, and then apply the fallback strategy by performing the backtest again with a different strategy (`'fallback_strategy'`). The results of this fallback backtest are then returned.

Please note that this is a simplified example. The actual implementation could be more complex depending on the specifics of your backtesting process and what you want your fallback strategy to do.
