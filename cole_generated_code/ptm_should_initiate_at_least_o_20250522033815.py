Sure, here is a simple example of a Python code that uses the alpaca-trade-api module to initiate a trade. Please replace 'APCA-API-KEY-ID' and 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY' with your actual Alpaca key ID and secret key.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API connection
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Get account information
account = api.get_account()
print(account)

# Check if the market is open
clock = api.get_clock()
print('The market is {}'.format('open.' if clock.is_open else 'closed.'))

# Initiate a trade if the market is open
if clock.is_open:
    # Define the parameters for the trade
    symbol = 'AAPL'  # Apple Inc.
    qty = 1  # Number of shares to buy
    side = 'buy'  # Buy or sell
    type = 'market'  # Market order
    time_in_force = 'gtc'  # Good till cancelled

    # Place the trade
    order = api.submit_order(
        symbol=symbol,
        qty=qty,
        side=side,
        type=type,
        time_in_force=time_in_force
    )

    print('Submitted {} order for {} shares of {}.'.format(side, qty, symbol))
```

This script checks if the market is open and, if it is, submits a market order to buy one share of Apple Inc. (AAPL). Note that this script uses Alpaca's paper trading API, which simulates trades but does not actually execute them in the real market. This is useful for gaining practical market insights without risking real money.

Please note that trading involves risk, and this example is oversimplified. In a real-world scenario, you would likely want to incorporate more complex logic to determine when and what to trade based on various factors such as price, volume, and other market data.
