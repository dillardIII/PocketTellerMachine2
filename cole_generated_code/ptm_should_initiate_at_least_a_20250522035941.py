Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a few trades and gathers data on wins and losses. This script assumes that you have a trading strategy in place, and that you have a method to determine whether a trade is a win or a loss.

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self):
        self.is_win = False

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []
        self.wins = 0
        self.losses = 0

    def initiate_trade(self):
        trade = Trade()
        # Assume we have a method to determine if a trade is a win or a loss
        trade.is_win = self.is_trade_a_win()
        self.trades.append(trade)
        if trade.is_win:
            self.wins += 1
        else:
            self.losses += 1

    def is_trade_a_win(self):
        # This is a placeholder. In real life, you would use your trading strategy here.
        return random.choice([True, False])

# Create a PTM and initiate a few trades
ptm = PTM()
for _ in range(5):
    ptm.initiate_trade()

# Print the results
print(f"Wins: {ptm.wins}")
print(f"Losses: {ptm.losses}")
```

This script initiates 5 trades and counts the number of wins and losses. The `is_trade_a_win` method is currently a placeholder that randomly returns True (win) or False (loss). In a real-world scenario, you would replace this with your actual trading strategy.
