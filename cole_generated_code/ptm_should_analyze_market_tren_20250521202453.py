While I can provide a basic example of how to analyze market trends using Python, it's important to note that creating a complete trading system is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of financial markets, trading strategies, and programming. Also, it's impossible to completely avoid losses in trading. The goal is to manage risk and make profits that outweigh the losses over time. 

Here's a simple example of how you might use Python to analyze market trends using a moving average crossover strategy. This strategy assumes that the market trend can be determined by comparing a short-term moving average to a long-term moving average. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate short-term and long-term moving averages
data['Short_Term_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['Long_Term_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create a column for the trading signals
data['Signal'] = 0.0
data['Signal'][data['Short_Term_MA'] > data['Long_Term_MA']] = 1.0

# Create a column for the trading positions
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Plot the data
plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label=ticker)
plt.plot(data['Short_Term_MA'], label='Short-Term MA')
plt.plot(data['Long_Term_MA'], label='Long-Term MA')
plt.plot(data.loc[data['Position'] == 1.0].index, 
         data['Short_Term_MA'][data['Position'] == 1.0], '^', markersize=10, color='g', label='buy')
plt.plot(data.loc[data['Position'] == -1.0].index, 
         data['Short_Term_MA'][data['Position'] == -1.0], 'v', markersize=10, color='r', label='sell')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.title('Market Trends & Trading Signals')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

This script downloads historical data for a ticker symbol, calculates short-term and long-term moving averages, generates trading signals based on these moving averages, and plots the results. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, this is interpreted as a bullish signal, and the script generates a "buy" signal. When the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, this is interpreted as a bearish signal, and the script generates a "sell" signal. 

Please note that this is a very simplistic trading strategy and is not guaranteed to be profitable. It's just an example of how you might begin to analyze market trends using Python.
