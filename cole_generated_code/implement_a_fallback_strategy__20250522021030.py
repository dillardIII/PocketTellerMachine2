Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. The function `run_backtest` is supposed to return backtest results. If no results are found (i.e., `run_backtest` returns `None`), the function `fallback_strategy` is called.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function should run the backtest and return the results
    # If no results are found, it should return None
    # For the purpose of this example, let's assume that no results are found
    return None

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement the fallback strategy
    # For the purpose of this example, let's just print a message
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")

# Run the backtest
backtest_results = run_backtest()

# If no backtest results are found, run the fallback strategy
if backtest_results is None:
    fallback_strategy()
```

Please replace the `run_backtest` and `fallback_strategy` functions with your own implementations. The `run_backtest` function should return the backtest results, and the `fallback_strategy` function should implement the fallback strategy.
