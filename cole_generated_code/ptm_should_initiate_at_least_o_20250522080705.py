Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code that uses an API to make a trade. In this example, I'll use the Alpaca API, which is a popular choice for algorithmic trading. Please replace the placeholders with your actual API key and secret.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Replace these with your API connection info
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Get account information
account = api.get_account()
print(account)

# Check if our account is restricted from trading.
if account.trading_blocked:
    print('Account is currently restricted from trading.')

# Check how much money we can use to open new positions.
print('${} is available as buying power.'.format(account.buying_power))

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)

# Get our position in AAPL
aapl_position = api.get_position('AAPL')

print(aapl_position)
```

This code will initiate a trade to buy 1 share of Apple stock and then print out the position. Remember, this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms can get very complex. Also, this code will execute a trade as soon as it is run, so be careful when testing.

Please note that you need to install the `alpaca-trade-api` Python package. You can install it using pip:

```sh
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Also, remember that trading involves risk, and this code is provided as an example. You should understand what the code does before running it.
