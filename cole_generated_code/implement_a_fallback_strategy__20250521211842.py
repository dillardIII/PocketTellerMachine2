Sure, here's a simple way to implement a fallback strategy in Python. I'm assuming that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that returns the backtest results or `None` if no results are found.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function should return the backtest results or None if no results are found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement the fallback strategy
    print("Running fallback strategy...")
    pass

# Run backtest
backtest_results = run_backtest()

# Check if backtest results are found
if backtest_results is None:
    # If no backtest results are found, run the fallback strategy
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    # If backtest results are found, proceed with the normal flow
    print("Backtest results found. Proceeding with normal flow...")
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` is the function that runs the backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, it returns `None`. The `fallback_strategy()` function is called when no backtest results are found. You should replace these functions with your actual backtest and fallback strategy implementations.
