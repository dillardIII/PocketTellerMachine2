Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def get_backtest_results(backtest_id):
    # This is a placeholder for the code that would actually get the backtest results.
    # It might involve a database query, an API call, etc.
    # For this example, let's just assume it returns None if no results are found.
    backtest_results = None

    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Falling back to default strategy.")
        return {}

    return backtest_results

# Use the function
results = get_backtest_results("123")
```

In this example, the fallback strategy is quite simple. Depending on your needs, it might involve more complex operations, such as running a different backtest, returning default results, etc. The key is to ensure that your code can handle the case where no backtest results are found, and that it does something sensible in that situation.
