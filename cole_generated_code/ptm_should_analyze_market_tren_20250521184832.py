To analyze market trends and identify potential trading opportunities, we can use Python's libraries like pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download the stock data, and matplotlib for data visualization. 

Here's a basic example of how you might set up a simple moving average crossover strategy, which is a common trend-following strategy.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download historical data for required stocks
data = yf.download('AAPL','2016-01-01','2021-12-31')

# Calculate the short-term exponential moving average (EMA)
ShortEMA = data.Close.ewm(span=12, adjust=False).mean()

# Calculate the long-term exponential moving average (EMA)
LongEMA = data.Close.ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()

# Create signals based on crossover
data['Buy_Signal'] = (ShortEMA > LongEMA)
data['Sell_Signal'] = (ShortEMA < LongEMA)

# Identify potential trading opportunities
buying_opportunities = data[data['Buy_Signal']].index
selling_opportunities = data[data['Sell_Signal']].index

print("Potential Buying Opportunities:")
print(buying_opportunities)
print("Potential Selling Opportunities:")
print(selling_opportunities)

# Plotting the stock price and the buy and sell signals
plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price', color='blue', alpha=0.35)
plt.plot(ShortEMA, label='Short/Fast EMA', color='red', alpha=0.35)
plt.plot(LongEMA, label='Long/Slow EMA', color='green', alpha=0.35)
plt.scatter(data.index, data[data['Buy_Signal']].Close, color='green', marker='^', alpha=1)
plt.scatter(data.index, data[data['Sell_Signal']].Close, color='red', marker='v', alpha=1)
plt.title('Apple Close Price - Buy & Sell Signals')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Close Price USD ($)')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```

This script will download the historical data for Apple's stock, calculate the short-term and long-term EMAs, generate buy and sell signals based on the crossover of these EMAs, and then plot the stock price and these signals.

Please note that this is a very basic form of trend analysis and real trading algorithms would use much more complex analysis and take into account many other factors.
