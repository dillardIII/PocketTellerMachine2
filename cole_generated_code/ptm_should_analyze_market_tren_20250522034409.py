Creating a Python script that analyzes market trends and patterns to identify potential trading opportunities is a complex task. It involves data analysis, machine learning, and financial knowledge. Here is a simple example of how you can start with Python. This example uses the pandas library to analyze stock data from Yahoo Finance.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL','2020-01-01','2022-01-01')

# Calculate moving average
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Create a 'Signal' column where if the 50-day SMA is greater than the 200-day SMA then set as 1, else 0.
data['Signal'] = 0.0  
data['Signal'][50:] = np.where(data['SMA_50'][50:] > data['SMA_200'][50:], 1.0, 0.0)   

# Create a 'Position' column which is the difference of the 'Signal' column, this shows where the signals take place in the dataframe
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Print the dataframe
print(data)

# Here we can see where the signals tell us to buy and sell
print(data[data['Position'] == 1])
print(data[data['Position'] == -1])
```

This is a very basic trading strategy known as a moving average crossover. It's not perfect and it's highly recommended to use other indicators and strategies to confirm the trend. Also, this doesn't take into account transaction costs and other factors that could influence the profitability of this strategy.

For a more advanced analysis, you would need to use machine learning algorithms to predict future prices or trends, and that would require a solid understanding of both machine learning and financial markets.
