Sure, here is a simple Python code using the `yfinance` library to download stock data, which can be used to initiate a trade and gain insights on market trends.

```python
import yfinance as yf

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL' # Apple Inc.

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2020-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Initiate a simple trade
# Buy if the closing price is higher than the opening price
if tickerDf['Close'][-1] > tickerDf['Open'][-1]:
    print("Initiate Buy Trade")
else:
    print("Initiate Sell Trade")
```

This code will download the historical price data for Apple Inc. for the year 2020. It will then initiate a buy trade if the closing price of the most recent day is higher than the opening price, otherwise it will initiate a sell trade.

Please note that this is a very simplistic trading strategy and is used for illustrative purposes only. In reality, trading strategies should be much more complex and take into account various other factors.

Also, please make sure to install the `yfinance` library before running the code. You can do this by running `pip install yfinance` in your command line.
