To analyze market trends and identify potential profitable trades, we can use Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computations, matplotlib for data visualization, and sklearn for machine learning. 

Here is a simple example of how you can use Python to analyze market trends. In this example, we will use a simple moving average strategy. If the price is above the moving average, it's a signal to buy. If the price is below the moving average, it's a signal to sell.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and real-world trading involves many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# Fetching the data
df = pdr.get_data_yahoo("AAPL", start="2020-01-01", end="2021-12-31")

# Calculating the short-window simple moving average
short_rolling = df.rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculating the long-window simple moving average
long_rolling = df.rolling(window=100).mean()

# Creating a new DataFrame to store all data
data = pd.DataFrame()
data['price'] = df['Adj Close']
data['short_mavg'] = short_rolling['Adj Close']
data['long_mavg'] = long_rolling['Adj Close']

# Creating signals
data['signal'] = 0.0
data['signal'][short_rolling['Adj Close'] > long_rolling['Adj Close']] = 1.0

# Generate trading orders
data['positions'] = data['signal'].diff()

# Print data
print(data)

# Plotting the data
fig = plt.figure()
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111, ylabel='Price in $')
data['price'].plot(ax=ax1, color='r', lw=2.)
data[['short_mavg', 'long_mavg']].plot(ax=ax1, lw=2.)

# Plotting the buy signals
ax1.plot(data.loc[data.positions == 1.0].index, 
         data.short_mavg[data.positions == 1.0],
         '^', markersize=10, color='m')

# Plotting the sell signals
ax1.plot(data.loc[data.positions == -1.0].index, 
         data.short_mavg[data.positions == -1.0],
         'v', markersize=10, color='k')

plt.show()
```

This code will fetch the historical data for Apple Inc. from Yahoo Finance, calculate the short-window (20 days) and long-window (100 days) simple moving averages, generate trading signals and plot the data with the buy and sell signals.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and real-world trading involves many more factors. Also, this code does not take into account trading fees or slippage. Always do your own research before making any trading decisions.
