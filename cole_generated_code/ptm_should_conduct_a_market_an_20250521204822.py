To complete this task, we would need access to a financial market data API like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or similar. Here is a simple example of how you might use the Alpha Vantage API to analyze stock data and identify potential trading opportunities. This example will identify stocks whose closing price was higher than the opening price by a certain percentage.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take many more factors into account.

```python
import requests
import json

# Alpha Vantage API Key
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# List of stocks to analyze
stocks = ['AAPL', 'GOOG', 'MSFT']

# Percentage increase to consider as a trading opportunity
percentage_increase = 2.0

def get_stock_data(symbol):
    base_url = 'https://www.alphavantage.co/query?'
    function = 'TIME_SERIES_DAILY'
    datatype = 'json'

    complete_api_link = f"{base_url}function={function}&symbol={symbol}&apikey={api_key}&datatype={datatype}"
    response = requests.get(complete_api_link)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return json.loads(response.text)
    else:
        return None

def analyze_stock_data(data):
    # Get the latest trading day data
    latest_day = list(data['Time Series (Daily)'].keys())[0]
    latest_data = data['Time Series (Daily)'][latest_day]

    # Calculate the percentage increase
    open_price = float(latest_data['1. open'])
    close_price = float(latest_data['4. close'])
    percentage_change = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100

    # If the percentage increase is higher than the threshold, return True
    if percentage_change > percentage_increase:
        return True
    else:
        return False

def identify_trading_opportunities():
    for stock in stocks:
        data = get_stock_data(stock)
        if data is not None:
            if analyze_stock_data(data):
                print(f"Potential trading opportunity identified for {stock}!")

identify_trading_opportunities()
```

Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual Alpha Vantage API key. This script will print out any stocks from the list that have increased by more than the specified percentage.
