To analyze market trends, we would need historical data of the market. This data can be obtained from various sources like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, etc. Here is a simple Python code using `pandas_datareader` library to fetch historical market data from Yahoo Finance and analyze it using moving averages.

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Fetching historical data
def fetch_data(ticker, start_date, end_date):
    df = pdr.get_data_yahoo(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)
    return df

# Calculating moving averages
def calculate_moving_averages(df, short_window, long_window):
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0
    
    signals['short_mavg'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
    signals['long_mavg'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
    
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                                > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()
    
    return signals

# Plotting data
def plot_data(df, signals):
    fig = plt.figure()
    
    ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111, ylabel='Price in $')
    
    df['Close'].plot(ax=ax1, color='r', lw=2.)
    signals[['short_mavg', 'long_mavg']].plot(ax=ax1, lw=2.)
    
    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == 1.0].index, 
             signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == 1.0],
             '^', markersize=10, color='m')
             
    ax1.plot(signals.loc[signals.positions == -1.0].index, 
             signals.short_mavg[signals.positions == -1.0],
             'v', markersize=10, color='k')
             
    plt.show()

# Fetching data
ticker = 'AAPL' # Apple stock
start_date = '2010-01-01'
end_date = '2020-12-31'
df = fetch_data(ticker, start_date, end_date)

# Calculating moving averages
short_window = 40
long_window = 100
signals = calculate_moving_averages(df, short_window, long_window)

# Plotting data
plot_data(df, signals)
```

This code fetches historical data of Apple stock from Yahoo Finance, calculates short-term (40 days) and long-term (100 days) moving averages, and plots the data. The green triangles indicate potential buy signals (when short-term moving average crosses above long-term moving average), and the red triangles indicate potential sell signals (when short-term moving average crosses below long-term moving average).

Please note that this is a very basic form of market trend analysis and should not be used for making real trading decisions. For more sophisticated analysis, you would need to consider other factors like volume, volatility, etc., and possibly use machine learning algorithms.
