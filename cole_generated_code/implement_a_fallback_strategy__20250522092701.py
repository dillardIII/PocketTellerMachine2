Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This example assumes that you are using a function called `get_backtest_results()` to get the backtest results and a function called `fallback_strategy()` as your fallback strategy.

```python
def execute_strategy():
    try:
        # Try to get backtest results
        results = get_backtest_results()
        
        if not results:
            # If no results are found, raise an exception
            raise ValueError("No backtest results found")
            
        # If results are found, process the results (this is just a placeholder)
        process_results(results)
        
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
        # If an exception is caught, execute the fallback strategy
        fallback_strategy()

def get_backtest_results():
    # This function should return the backtest results
    # For now, it just returns None
    return None

def process_results(results):
    # This function should process the backtest results
    print("Processing results...")

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement your fallback strategy
    print("Executing fallback strategy...")

# Execute the strategy
execute_strategy()
```

In this code, if `get_backtest_results()` returns `None` or an empty list (or any other value that evaluates to `False`), a `ValueError` is raised and caught, and the `fallback_strategy()` function is called.
