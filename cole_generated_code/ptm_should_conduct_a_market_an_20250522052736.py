To conduct a market analysis, we need to gather data from the market, analyze it, and identify potential trading opportunities. Here is a simple Python code using pandas library to analyze stock market data. Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and involve many other factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Define the ticker list
tickers_list = ['AAPL', 'WMT', 'IBM', 'GOOG', 'MSFT']

# Fetch the data
data = yf.download(tickers_list,'2020-1-1')['Adj Close']

# Print first 5 rows of the data
print(data.head())

# Calculate daily returns
returns = data.pct_change()

# Identify potential trading opportunities
# Here we are simply identifying the stocks with highest and lowest returns for the next day
# This is a very basic strategy and may not yield profitable trades in a real-world scenario
next_day_opportunities = returns.idxmax(axis=1)

print("Potential trading opportunities for the next day:")
print(next_day_opportunities)
```

This code uses Yahoo Finance to fetch the data, calculates the daily returns of the stocks, and identifies the stocks with the highest returns for the next day as potential trading opportunities. 

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and may not yield profitable trades in a real-world scenario. A real-world trading algorithm would take into account many other factors such as volume, volatility, news, etc. Also, this code assumes that the highest return stock of the previous day will be the highest return stock of the next day, which may not be true. 

Also, please note that trading in the stock market involves risk and this code should not be used for real trading without proper knowledge and understanding of the stock market.
