To complete this task, we would need real-time market data. Python has several libraries that can be used to fetch this data. For this example, we will use the `yfinance` library to fetch stock market data. We will also use `pandas` for data manipulation and `numpy` for calculations. We will use `matplotlib` for plotting the data.

Please note that this is a very basic example of how you can analyze market trends and adjust trading strategies. In real-world scenarios, you would need much more complex algorithms and a lot more data to make accurate predictions.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Fetch data for a specific stock
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate the moving average
data['MA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['MA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Plot the close price and the moving averages
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price')
plt.plot(data['MA_50'], label='50-day Moving Average')
plt.plot(data['MA_200'], label='200-day Moving Average')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()

# Create a basic trading strategy
data['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(data['MA_50'] > data['MA_200'], 1, 0)
data['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(data['MA_50'] < data['MA_200'], 1, 0)

# Print the data
print(data)

# Note: This is a very basic trading strategy and should not be used for real trading without further improvements.
```

In this code, we first fetch the data for the Apple stock. We then calculate the 50-day and 200-day moving averages and plot them along with the closing price. We then create a very basic trading strategy where we generate a buy signal when the 50-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average and a sell signal when it's below.
