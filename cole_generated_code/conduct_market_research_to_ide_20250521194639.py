As a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I'm unable to execute Python code or interact with live databases or APIs. However, I can provide you with a Python code example that could be used to analyze stock data for potential profitable trades. This code uses the `pandas` library to analyze data and `yfinance` to download stock data. 

This is a simple example and does not take into account many factors that could influence stock prices. Please use this as a starting point and consult with a financial advisor or use more advanced techniques for actual trading.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Define the list of stocks we will look at
stocks = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'FB']

# Define the start and end date for the data we will download
start_date = '2022-01-01'
end_date = '2022-12-31'

# Create an empty DataFrame to store the adjusted close price of the stocks
df = pd.DataFrame()

# Download the stock data and save the adjusted close prices in df
for stock in stocks:
    data = yf.download(stock, start=start_date, end=end_date)
    df[stock] = data['Adj Close']

# Calculate the daily returns
returns = df.pct_change()

# Identify potential profitable trades
# This is a simple example where we consider a stock to be a potential profitable trade if its average daily return is positive
potential_trades = returns.mean() > 0

print("Potential profitable trades for the next day:")
for stock, is_potential_trade in potential_trades.items():
    if is_potential_trade:
        print(stock)
```

This script identifies stocks that have had an average daily return greater than 0 in the specified date range as potential profitable trades. This is a very simplistic approach and real trading algorithms consider many more factors and use more complex mathematical models.
