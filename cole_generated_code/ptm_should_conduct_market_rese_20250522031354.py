To conduct market research, we can use Python libraries such as pandas, yfinance, and matplotlib. The following code will fetch the historical market data for a specific stock (e.g., Apple Inc.) and plot its closing price. It's a simple example of market research, but in reality, you would need to analyze many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-1-25')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Plot the closing prices
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(tickerDf['Close'])
plt.title('Historical closing price: {}'.format(tickerSymbol))
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Closing price ($)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Please note that this code is a very basic example of market research. In real-world trading, you would need to consider many more factors, such as the company's financials, news, market trends, etc. Also, you would need to analyze many stocks, not just one.

This code uses the yfinance library, which allows you to download stock data from Yahoo Finance. If you want to analyze data from other sources, you would need to use their APIs, if available.
