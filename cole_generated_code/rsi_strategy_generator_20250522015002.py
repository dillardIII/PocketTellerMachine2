The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market.

Here is a simple Python code to generate a trading strategy based on RSI:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# Fetching the data
def get_data(symbol, start_date, end_date):
    df = pdr.get_data_yahoo(symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)
    return df

# Calculating RSI
def calculate_RSI(data, window):
    delta = data['Adj Close'].diff()
    up_days = delta.copy()
    up_days[delta<=0]=0.0
    down_days = abs(delta.copy())
    down_days[delta>0]=0.0
    RS_up = up_days.rolling(window).mean()
    RS_down = down_days.rolling(window).mean()
    rsi= 100-100/(1+RS_up/RS_down)
    data['RSI'] = rsi
    return data

# Implementing the strategy
def implement_RSI_strategy(data, low_RSI, high_RSI):
    data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['RSI'] < low_RSI)
    data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['RSI'] > high_RSI)
    return data

# Fetching the data
data = get_data('AAPL', '2020-01-01', '2021-12-31')

# Calculating RSI
window_length = 14
data = calculate_RSI(data, window_length)

# Implementing the strategy
low_RSI = 30
high_RSI = 70
data = implement_RSI_strategy(data, low_RSI, high_RSI)

print(data)
```

This code fetches the data for a specific symbol (in this case, 'AAPL') for a specific time period, calculates the RSI with a window length of 14 (which is the standard period used), and then generates buy signals when the RSI is below 30 (indicating that the stock is oversold) and sell signals when the RSI is above 70 (indicating that the stock is overbought).
