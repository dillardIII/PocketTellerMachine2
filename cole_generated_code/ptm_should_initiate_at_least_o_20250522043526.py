Sure, here's a simple example of how you might initiate a trade using Python. This example uses the `yfinance` library to get stock data and `alpaca_trade_api` to initiate the trade. 

Please replace `APCA-API-KEY-ID` and `APCA-API-SECRET-KEY` with your actual Alpaca API key and secret.

```python
import yfinance as yf
from alpaca_trade_api import REST

# Define Alpaca API
api = REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Define the stock to trade
stock = 'AAPL'

# Get the stock data
data = yf.download(stock, start='2022-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Get the last closing price
last_close = data['Close'][-1]

# Define the number of shares to buy
num_shares = 1

# If the last closing price is less than 100, initiate a buy order
if last_close < 100:
    api.submit_order(
        symbol=stock,
        qty=num_shares,
        side='buy',
        type='market',
        time_in_force='gtc'
    )
```

This script will initiate a buy order for 1 share of Apple stock if the last closing price was less than 100. Please note that this is a very simplistic trading strategy and is unlikely to generate significant wins without further refinement. 

Also, please note that this script uses a paper trading API endpoint, which means it's using simulated money, not real money. When you're ready to trade with real money, you'll need to update the `base_url` to Alpaca's live trading endpoint. 

Please be aware that trading stocks involves risk, and you should only trade with money that you can afford to lose.
