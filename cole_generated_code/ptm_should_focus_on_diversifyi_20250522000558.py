Your request is a bit broad and it's not clear what exactly you want to do, but I can provide a simple Python code that simulates a diversified portfolio. This code will randomly select stocks from a list to create a diversified portfolio.

```python
import random

# List of potential stocks for our portfolio
stocks = ['AAPL', 'GOOG', 'TSLA', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'FB', 'BABA', 'V', 'JPM', 'JNJ', 'WMT', 'PG', 'MA', 'INTC', 'VZ', 'XOM', 'CSCO', 'BA', 'KO', 'DIS']

def create_portfolio(stocks, num_stocks):
    """
    This function creates a diversified portfolio by randomly selecting
    a specified number of stocks from a list.
    """
    if num_stocks > len(stocks):
        return "The number of stocks in the portfolio can't be greater than the available stocks"
    else:
        portfolio = random.sample(stocks, num_stocks)
        return portfolio

# Create a diversified portfolio with 10 stocks
portfolio = create_portfolio(stocks, 10)
print(portfolio)
```

This code will output a list of 10 stocks randomly selected from the list of available stocks. This is a very basic example and does not take into account the actual value or performance of the stocks, it simply ensures that the portfolio is diversified by including different stocks.

In reality, creating a diversified trading portfolio involves a lot more complexity, including analyzing the performance and risk associated with each stock, and balancing the portfolio to achieve a desired level of risk and return. This would require a more complex algorithm and potentially the use of a financial library or API to get real-time stock data.
