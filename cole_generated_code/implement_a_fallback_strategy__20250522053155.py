Sure, here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that returns backtest results. If no results are found, the fallback strategy is executed.

```python
def fallback_strategy():
    # Fallback strategy implementation goes here
    print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")

def execute_strategy():
    # Run backtest
    results = run_backtest()

    # Check if results are empty
    if not results:
        # If no results, execute fallback strategy
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # Otherwise, proceed with the original strategy
        print("Backtest results found. Proceeding with original strategy...")
        # Original strategy implementation goes here

execute_strategy()
```

Please replace the `print` statements and add the actual implementation of the original and fallback strategies. Also, you need to implement the `run_backtest()` function which should return the backtest results.
