Sure, here is a basic example of how we might simulate a trade using Python:

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, ticker, volume, price):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.volume = volume
        self.price = price

    def cost(self):
        return self.volume * self.price

# initialize a trade
trade = Trade("PTM", 100, 10.00)

# print trade details
print(f'Ticker: {trade.ticker}, Volume: {trade.volume}, Price: {trade.price}, Total Cost: {trade.cost()}')
```

This code initializes a basic `Trade` class with the necessary components of a trade: a ticker symbol, a volume (or number of shares), and a price. There's also a `cost` method that calculates the total cost of the trade by multiplying the volume by the price.

Finally, we initialize a single trade with ticker "PTM", a volume of 100 shares, and a price of $10.00 per share. We then print the details of this trade, including its total cost.

Remember that in real-world applications you would typically retrieve price information and execute trades using a trading API, and would also need to handle more complex factors such as multiple orders, order types and statuses, fees, market hours and limitations etc. This is a simplified simulation to illustrate the concept.
