Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that initiates a trade. This is a very basic example and doesn't include any specific trading strategies. For a real-world application, you would need to integrate with a trading platform API and implement specific trading logic.

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, symbol, quantity, trade_type):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.trade_type = trade_type

    def execute_trade(self):
        print(f"Executing {self.trade_type} trade for {self.quantity} of {self.symbol}")

# Initialize a trade
trade = Trade("AAPL", 100, "buy")

# Execute the trade
trade.execute_trade()
```

This code defines a `Trade` class with `symbol`, `quantity`, and `trade_type` attributes. The `execute_trade` method prints a message indicating that a trade is being executed. In a real-world application, this method would contain the logic to interact with a trading platform and execute the trade.

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In a real-world application, you would need to handle many more aspects, such as authentication with the trading platform, error handling, trade confirmation, etc.
