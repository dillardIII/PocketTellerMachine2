Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code that implements a basic trading strategy. This strategy will be based on a simple moving average (SMA). When the price is above the SMA, it will signal to buy, and when it is below the SMA, it will signal to sell. 

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and in real trading scenarios, strategies can get much more complex. Also, this code assumes that you have historical price data in a pandas DataFrame called `df` with 'Close' prices.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assuming df is your DataFrame and it has a 'Close' column with prices
# Calculate the SMA for the last 20 days
df['SMA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Create a column to hold the trading signals
df['Signal'] = 0.0

# Generate trading signals based on the SMA
df.loc[df['Close'] > df['SMA'], 'Signal'] = 1.0   # Signal to buy
df.loc[df['Close'] < df['SMA'], 'Signal'] = -1.0  # Signal to sell

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```

This code will add a 'Signal' column to your DataFrame. A value of 1 means it's a signal to buy, -1 means it's a signal to sell, and 0 means there's no action to be taken.

Please remember that this is a very basic strategy and should not be used for real trading without further improvements and testing. It's always recommended to backtest any strategy before live trading.
