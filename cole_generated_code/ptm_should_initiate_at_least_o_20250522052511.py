Sure, I can provide a very basic example of how a Python trading bot might initiate a trade using the Alpaca API. Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading involves much more complexity.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Setup
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Get account information
account = api.get_account()
print(account)

# Check if our account is restricted from trading.
if account.trading_blocked:
    print('Account is currently restricted from trading.')

# Check how much money we have to work with.
print('${} is available as cash'.format(account.cash))

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

Please replace '<APCA-API-KEY-ID>' and '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>' with your actual Alpaca API key ID and secret key. This code will check if your account is allowed to trade and how much cash is available. Then it will submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock.

Remember that this is a very basic example. In real-world scenarios, you would need to implement more complex strategies, handle errors, and possibly use real-time data to make decisions. Always be careful when trading with real money and make sure to test your code thoroughly.
