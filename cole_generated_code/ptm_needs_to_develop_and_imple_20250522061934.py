To develop and implement trading strategies, we would need to consider various factors like historical data, current market trends, risk tolerance, etc. Here's a simple Python code that uses a basic moving average crossover strategy for trading. This strategy is used to identify potential buy and sell signals.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and real-world trading involves much more complex strategies and risk management.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    sma = data.rolling(window=window).mean()
    return sma

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    ema = data.ewm(span=window).mean()
    return ema

def trading_strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    # Calculate the short and long window simple moving averages
    sma_short = calculate_sma(data, short_window)
    sma_long = calculate_sma(data, long_window)

    # Create a 'signals' DataFrame with the signal information
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
    signals['signal'] = 0.0

    # Generate trading signals (1 for buy, -1 for sell)
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(sma_short[short_window:] > sma_long[short_window:], 1.0, -1.0)

    # Generate trading orders based on the signals
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    return signals

# Fetch the data
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = web.DataReader(ticker, 'yahoo', start='01-01-2020', end='31-12-2020')

# Implement the trading strategy
signals = trading_strategy(data['Close'], 50, 200)

# Print the resulting signals
print(signals)
```

This code fetches the historical data for a given ticker (in this case, 'AAPL') from Yahoo Finance, calculates the short and long window simple moving averages (SMA), and generates trading signals based on these SMAs. A buy signal is generated when the short window SMA crosses above the long window SMA, and a sell signal is generated when the short window SMA crosses below the long window SMA.
