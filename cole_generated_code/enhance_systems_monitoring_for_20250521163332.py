Certainly, here's a basic diagram of how you could arrange your Python code.

This task requires a sizeable amount of development work; therefore, note that the implementation provided isn't a full and complete solution, but it does show you the way to construct a monitoring system for your trade adjustments. The main focus is on creating classes to monitor the system, check if certain conditions are met (like a threshold), and signal when to make trade adjustments.

```python
import time

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, id, value):
        self.id = id
        self.value = value
        self.adjusted = False

class TradeMonitor:
    def __init__(self, threshold):
        self.trades = []
        self.threshold = threshold

    def add_trade(self, trade):
        self.trades.append(trade)
        self.check_trade(trade)

    def check_trade(self, trade):
        if trade.value > self.threshold and not trade.adjusted:
            trade.adjusted = True
            print("Trade Adjustment Alert - Trade ID:", trade.id)

class SystemMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trade_monitor = TradeMonitor(threshold=50000)

    def on_new_trade(self, trade):
        self.trade_monitor.add_trade(trade)

system_monitor = SystemMonitor()

while True:
    # Simulating trades happening over time
    # Replace this with your own logic to get/update trades
    trade_id = 1
    trade_value = 55000  # This value could change as trades occur
    trade = Trade(trade_id, trade_value)

    system_monitor.on_new_trade(trade)
    time.sleep(1)  # To simulate trades happening over time, sleep for 1 second
```

In this example, a new trade is created every second with a value of 55000, the system should output a trade adjustment alert since it's over our threshold of 50000.

This can be adapted to your specific needs, you can change the condition for when to adjust trades (in our case it's a simple value check, but this could be any complex computation).
