Creating a Python program to analyze market trends and patterns is a complex task that involves a lot of data analysis and machine learning. Here is a simple example of how you might start to approach this problem using the pandas library for data analysis and the yfinance library to download stock price data.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
def download_data(ticker_symbol):
    data = yf.download(ticker_symbol, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')
    return data

# Calculate moving average of the last N days
def calculate_moving_average(data, N):
    MA = pd.Series(data['Close'].rolling(N, min_periods=N).mean(), name='MA_' + str(N))
    data = data.join(MA)
    return data

# Identify potential buy/sell opportunities
def identify_opportunities(data, N):
    buy_signals = []
    sell_signals = []
    for i in range(N, len(data)):
        if data['MA_' + str(N)].iloc[i] > data['Close'].iloc[i]:
            buy_signals.append(data['Close'].iloc[i])
            sell_signals.append(float('nan'))
        elif data['MA_' + str(N)].iloc[i] < data['Close'].iloc[i]:
            sell_signals.append(data['Close'].iloc[i])
            buy_signals.append(float('nan'))
        else:
            buy_signals.append(float('nan'))
            sell_signals.append(float('nan'))
    return buy_signals, sell_signals

ticker_symbol = 'AAPL'
data = download_data(ticker_symbol)
N = 20
data = calculate_moving_average(data, N)
buy_signals, sell_signals = identify_opportunities(data, N)

print("Buy signals: ", buy_signals)
print("Sell signals: ", sell_signals)
```

This script downloads the historical price data for a given ticker symbol, calculates the moving average of the closing price over the last N days, and generates buy signals when the closing price is below the moving average and sell signals when the closing price is above the moving average.

Please note that this is a very simplistic strategy and is not recommended for actual trading. It's just an example of how you might start to approach this problem.
