To analyze the EMA (Exponential Moving Average) crossover, we need to calculate EMA for two different periods and then detect when the EMA of the shorter period crosses the EMA of the longer period. This usually indicates a potential price trend change and is considered a buy or sell signal by traders. 

A simple Python script using Pandas library to calculate EMA and to find the crossover points is as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
import datetime as dt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load historical data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end=dt.date.today())

# Calculate EMA for two different periods (short=12, long=26)
data['Short_EMA'] = data['Close'].ewm(span=12, adjust=False).mean()
data['Long_EMA'] = data['Close'].ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()

# create a new column 'Signal' such that if short EMA is higher than long EMA then set it as 1 else 0
data['Signal'] = np.where(data['Short_EMA'] > data['Long_EMA'], 1.0, 0.0)

# create a new column 'Crossover' which is the difference between 'Signal' and shifted 'Signal', 
# positive values indicates price going up and vice versa
data['Crossover'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# plot the close price along with short term and long term EMAs
plt.figure(figsize=(12.5,4.5))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price', color = 'blue')
plt.plot(data['Short_EMA'], label='Short/Fast EMA', color = 'red')
plt.plot(data['Long_EMA'], label='Long/Slow EMA', color = 'green')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()

# print crossover points
print("EMA crossover points: \n", data.loc[data['Crossover'] != 0.0])
```

Please replace 'AAPL' with the required symbol for the stock and adjust the start and end dates. This script also assumes that the shorter EMA is 12 days and the longer EMA is 26 days, these can be adjusted as per need.
Make sure to install the necessary Python libraries if not already installed.
