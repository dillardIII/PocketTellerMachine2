Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. 

```python
def backtest_strategy(data):
    try:
        # Assume backtest() is a function that performs backtesting and returns results
        results = backtest(data)
        
        if not results:
            raise ValueError("No backtest results found")
            
        return results
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
        print("Implementing fallback strategy...")
        
        # Implement your fallback strategy here
        fallback_results = fallback_strategy(data)
        
        return fallback_results
```

In this code, we first try to perform backtesting on the provided data. If no results are found (i.e., `results` is empty), we raise a `ValueError`. In the `except` block, we catch this exception, print an error message, and then implement a fallback strategy. The fallback strategy is assumed to be another function `fallback_strategy()`, which you would need to implement according to your specific needs.
