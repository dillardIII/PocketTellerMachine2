Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, I'm assuming that the backtest function returns None when no results are found. 

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for your backtest function
    # It should return the backtest results if they exist, otherwise None
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your fallback strategy
    # It should be implemented according to your requirements
    pass

def execute_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest(strategy)
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Executing fallback strategy...")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found. Executing main strategy...")
        # Here you would normally do something with the results

# Test the function with a strategy
execute_strategy("my_strategy")
```

Please replace the `backtest` and `fallback_strategy` functions with your actual functions. The `execute_strategy` function checks if the backtest results exist and executes the main strategy if they do. If not, it executes the fallback strategy.
