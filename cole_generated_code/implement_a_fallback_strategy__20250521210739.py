Sure, here is a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. 

```python
def backtest_strategy(data):
    # Assume backtest() is a function that performs backtesting and returns results
    results = backtest(data)
    
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Fallback strategy can be anything. Here, I am just re-running the backtest with modified data.
        # Assume modify_data() is a function that modifies the data for the fallback strategy
        modified_data = modify_data(data)
        fallback_results = backtest(modified_data)
        
        if not fallback_results:
            print("Fallback strategy also failed. Please check the data or the backtest function.")
            return None
        else:
            return fallback_results
    else:
        return results
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the `backtest()` and `modify_data()` functions are not provided here as they would depend on the specifics of your trading strategy and data. This is just a general structure of how you can implement a fallback strategy.
