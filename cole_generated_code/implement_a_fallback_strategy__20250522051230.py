Sure, here's a simple Python function that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. The fallback strategy could be different based on your specific needs. Here, I've assumed that we will return a message saying "No backtest results found. Please try again." when no results are found.

```python
def backtest_strategy(data):
    # Assume that 'data' is the backtest results
    if not data:
        # Fallback strategy when no backtest results are found
        return "No backtest results found. Please try again."
    else:
        # Process the backtest results
        # This is just a placeholder. Replace this with your actual code.
        return process_backtest_results(data)

def process_backtest_results(data):
    # Placeholder function. Replace this with your actual code to process backtest results.
    return "Processed backtest results."
```

In this code, `backtest_strategy` is the main function that you would call with the backtest results. If the results are empty (or `None`), it returns a fallback message. Otherwise, it processes the results by calling `process_backtest_results`. You would need to replace `process_backtest_results` with your actual code to process the backtest results.
