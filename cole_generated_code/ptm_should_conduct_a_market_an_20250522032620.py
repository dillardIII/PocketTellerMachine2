To conduct a market analysis, we can use Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download the historical market data, and matplotlib for data visualization. Here is a simple example of how you can do this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL' # Apple Inc.

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Plot Close price data
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(tickerDf['Close'])
plt.title('Historical Close Price')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Close Price (USD)')
plt.show()
```

This code will download the historical market data for Apple Inc. from 2010 to 2020 and plot the close price data. You can replace 'AAPL' with any ticker symbol of the company you're interested in.

Please note that this is a very basic form of market analysis. For a more comprehensive analysis, you may need to consider other factors such as volume data, other companies' data, market news, etc. Also, you may need to apply some financial theories or machine learning techniques to identify potential trading opportunities.
