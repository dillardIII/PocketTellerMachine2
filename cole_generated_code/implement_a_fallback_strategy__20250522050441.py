Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the function will return a message saying "No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy."

```python
def backtest_strategy(data):
    # Assume 'data' is the backtest results
    if not data:  # If data is empty
        return "No backtest results found. Using fallback strategy."
    else:
        # Process the backtest results
        processed_data = process_data(data)
        return processed_data

def process_data(data):
    # Implement your data processing logic here
    pass
```

This is a very basic example. Depending on your specific needs and the complexity of your trading system, your fallback strategy could involve more complex operations such as switching to a different trading strategy, using a different set of parameters, or even pausing trading altogether.
