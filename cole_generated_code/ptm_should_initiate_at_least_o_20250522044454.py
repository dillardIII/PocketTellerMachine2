To initiate a trade, you would typically need to interact with a trading API. Here's a basic example of how you might do this using the Alpaca API, a popular choice for algorithmic trading. This example will place a buy order for 100 shares of a stock.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
BASE_URL = 'https://paper-api.alpaca.markets'  # use paper trading URL

# Initialize the API
api = tradeapi.REST(API_KEY, SECRET_KEY, base_url=BASE_URL)

# Define the stock symbol and number of shares
symbol = 'AAPL'  # Apple Inc.
qty = 100  # number of shares to buy

# Place a buy order
order = api.submit_order(
    symbol=symbol,
    qty=qty,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)

print(f"Placed order to buy {qty} shares of {symbol}")
```

Please replace 'your_api_key' and 'your_secret_key' with your actual API key and secret key. This script will place a market order to buy 100 shares of AAPL. The order type is 'gtc' (good till cancelled), meaning it will remain active until it is manually cancelled.

Remember, this is a simple example. A real trading bot would need to implement more complex strategies, manage risk, and handle various edge cases.
