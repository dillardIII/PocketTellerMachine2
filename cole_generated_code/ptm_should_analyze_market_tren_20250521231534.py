Creating a trading bot that analyzes market trends and patterns is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of both programming and finance. Here is a simplified example of how you might start to approach this task using Python and the pandas library for data analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Load historical market data from a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Calculate moving averages
df['SMA_50'] = df['price'].rolling(window=50).mean()
df['SMA_200'] = df['price'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Create a 'buy' column where if the 50-day moving average is greater than the 200-day moving average, it is a good time to buy
df['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(df['SMA_50'] > df['SMA_200'], 1, 0)

# Split the data into training set and test set
X = df['SMA_50'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = df['Buy_Signal'].values.reshape(-1,1)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()  
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions using the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy of the model
print('Accuracy:', metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
```

This is a very basic model that only uses simple moving averages to generate trading signals. A real trading bot would use a much more complex model and would take into account many more factors. It's also important to note that trading bots can be risky and should be used with caution.
