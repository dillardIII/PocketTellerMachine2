Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. Please note that in a real-world scenario, you would need to use a trading API to execute trades.

```python
class PTM:
    def __init__(self, strategy):
        self.strategy = strategy
        self.trades = 0

    def initiate_trade(self):
        print(f"Initiating trade using {self.strategy} strategy...")
        # In a real-world scenario, you would use a trading API to execute the trade here.
        # For example:
        # api.execute_trade(self.strategy)
        self.trades += 1
        print(f"Trade executed. Total trades: {self.trades}")

    def assess_strategy(self):
        if self.trades > 0:
            print(f"Assessing effectiveness of {self.strategy} strategy...")
            # In a real-world scenario, you would use some metrics to assess the strategy here.
            # For example:
            # effectiveness = api.assess_strategy(self.strategy)
            # print(f"Effectiveness of {self.strategy} strategy: {effectiveness}")
        else:
            print("No trades executed yet. Cannot assess strategy.")

# Usage:
ptm = PTM("Buy and Hold")
ptm.initiate_trade()
ptm.assess_strategy()
```

This code defines a class `PTM` that represents a trading machine. It has a method `initiate_trade` to execute a trade and a method `assess_strategy` to assess the effectiveness of its current strategy. The `initiate_trade` method increases the number of trades and the `assess_strategy` method checks if there were any trades executed before assessing the strategy.
