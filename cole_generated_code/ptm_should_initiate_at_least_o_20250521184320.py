Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade using a hypothetical trading API. Please note that this is a simplified example and actual trading involves more complexities.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 10000  # initial balance
        self.stocks = 0  # initial stocks

    def get_market_price(self):
        # In real trading, you would get the price from the market.
        # Here we just generate a random price for simplicity.
        return random.uniform(50, 150)

    def buy(self, price, quantity):
        cost = price * quantity
        if cost > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient balance")
            return
        self.balance -= cost
        self.stocks += quantity
        print(f"Bought {quantity} stocks at {price} each. Remaining balance: {self.balance}")

    def sell(self, price, quantity):
        if quantity > self.stocks:
            print("Insufficient stocks")
            return
        self.stocks -= quantity
        self.balance += price * quantity
        print(f"Sold {quantity} stocks at {price} each. Remaining balance: {self.balance}")

    def trade(self):
        price = self.get_market_price()
        if self.balance > price:
            # Buy one stock
            self.buy(price, 1)
        elif self.stocks > 0:
            # Sell one stock
            self.sell(price, 1)

# Create a PTM and initiate a trade
ptm = PTM()
ptm.trade()
```

This code creates a PTM (Pretend Trading Machine) that can buy and sell stocks at a random market price. The `trade` method decides whether to buy or sell based on the current balance and the number of stocks owned. If the balance is enough to buy at least one stock, it buys. If not, and if it owns at least one stock, it sells. This way, it guarantees that at least one trade is initiated.
