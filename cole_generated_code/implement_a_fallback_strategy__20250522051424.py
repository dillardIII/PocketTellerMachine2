Here is a simple Python code to implement a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs the backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, the fallback strategy is executed.

```python
def fallback_strategy():
    # Implement your fallback strategy here
    print("Running fallback strategy...")

def check_backtest_results():
    results = run_backtest()

    if not results:  # if results are empty or None
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        return results

def run_backtest():
    # Implement your backtest here
    # This is a placeholder implementation
    return None

# Run the check
check_backtest_results()
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` is a placeholder function and needs to be replaced with your actual backtest function. The `fallback_strategy()` function is also a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual fallback strategy you want to implement.
