Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code that uses a basic trading strategy. This strategy is called Moving Average Crossover, which is one of the most popular strategies used in algorithmic trading.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and might not be profitable in real trading. You should always backtest and improve your strategies before using them in real trading.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# Define the ticker list
tickers_list = ['AAPL', 'WMT', 'IBM', 'MU', 'BA', 'AXP']

# Fetch the data
def getData(ticker):
    data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")
    return data

# Create a function to signal when to buy and sell an asset
def strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    # Create a 'Signal' column
    data['Signal'] = 0.0
    # Create short simple moving average over the short window
    data['Short_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
    # Create long simple moving average over the long window
    data['Long_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()
    # Generate signals
    data['Signal'][short_window:] = np.where(data['Short_MA'][short_window:] > data['Long_MA'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)
    # Generate trading orders
    data['Positions'] = data['Signal'].diff()

# Implement the strategy for all stocks in the list
for ticker in tickers_list:
    data = getData(ticker)
    strategy(data, 50, 200)
    print(data)
```

This code fetches historical data for a list of stocks and applies the Moving Average Crossover strategy to each of them. The strategy generates a buy signal when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, and a sell signal when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.

Please install the required libraries by running `pip install pandas pandas_datareader yfinance numpy` before running the code.
