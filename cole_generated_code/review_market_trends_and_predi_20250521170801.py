As an AI developed by OpenAI currently, I can't review real market trends or make predictions directly. Also, to make actual trades based on those predictions require advanced knowledge in quantitative finance, machine-learning algorithms, and using APIs of trading platforms like E-Trade and TD Ameritrade.

However, I can suggest a base framework of how the system should work. You might want to start by first collecting data from a reliable source. This can be done using libraries like pandas_datareader to fetch historical market data.

Then, you can use various approaches to predict future trends. Below is an oversimplified example of how you might use a simple linear regression model to make predictions.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# Fetch data
df = pdr.get_data_yahoo('AAPL', start='2021-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Prepare data for model
df['Prediction'] = df['Adj Close'].shift(-1)
X = np.array(df.drop(['Prediction'], 1))[:-1]
Y = np.array(df['Prediction'])[:-1]

# Split the data
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size = 0.2)

# Training the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Testing the model
y_pred = model.predict(x_test)
print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)) 

# Predicting next day price
x_forecast = np.array(df.drop(['Prediction'], 1))[-1:]
print('Predicted price for the next trading day:', model.predict(x_forecast))
```

Please note that:
1. This is a very simplified model, and its use in a real trading situation is extremely limited. Real trading systems use far more complex models, many input features, and both human and machine decision making.
2. Don't invest based on these predictions. The real world stock market is influenced by countless factors, many of which are not accounted for in this simple regression model. Use this only as a starting point to learn how you might approach this problem.
