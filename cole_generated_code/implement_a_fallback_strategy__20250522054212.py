Sure, here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` which runs the backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, it will run a fallback strategy defined in the function `fallback_strategy()`.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    # This function should return the results of the backtest or None if no results are found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your fallback strategy code here
    # This function should return the results of the fallback strategy
    pass

def main():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
        results = fallback_strategy()

    # Continue with your code using the results
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please replace the `pass` statements with your actual code. The `run_backtest()` function should run the backtest and return the results, or `None` if no results are found. The `fallback_strategy()` function should implement your fallback strategy and return its results. The `main()` function runs the backtest and uses the fallback strategy if no backtest results are found.
