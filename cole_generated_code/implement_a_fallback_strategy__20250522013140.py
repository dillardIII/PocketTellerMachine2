Sure, here is a simple example of how you can implement a fallback strategy in Python when no backtest results are found. This example assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs the backtest and returns the results, and a function `fallback_strategy()` that implements the fallback strategy.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function runs the backtest and returns the results
    # If no results found, it returns None
    # This is just a placeholder. Replace it with your actual function
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function implements the fallback strategy
    # This is just a placeholder. Replace it with your actual function
    pass

# Run the backtest
backtest_results = run_backtest()

# If no backtest results are found, implement the fallback strategy
if backtest_results is None:
    print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    print("Backtest results found.")
    # Continue with your usual processing of the backtest results
```

This is a basic example. Depending on your specific requirements, you might need to modify this code. For example, you might need to pass some arguments to the `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` functions, or you might need to do something with the result of the `fallback_strategy()`.
