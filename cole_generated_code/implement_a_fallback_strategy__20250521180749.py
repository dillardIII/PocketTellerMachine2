Sure, in order to implement a fallback strategy we must first define what the fallback strategy is. Supposing it was to return a default list of results when no backtest results are found, the code might look something like the below:

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    """
    Use a given strategy to backtest some trading data. If no results, use fallback.
    :param strategy: A trading strategy to test.
    :return: The results of the backtest.
    """

    # Assuming the function 'backtest' applies the strategy to some data and returns
    # the results of the backtest.
    results = backtest(strategy)

    if not results:
        # No results were found, use the fallback strategy.
        print("No results found, applying fallback strategy.")
        results = fallback_strategy()

    return results


def backtest(strategy):
    """
    Dummy backtest function to illustrate the example.
    :param strategy: The strategy to backtest.
    :return: Return backtest results (currently always returns None).
    """

    # In the real implementation, this function will return some results.
    return None


def fallback_strategy():
    """
    A fallback strategy when no backtest results are found.
    :return: Returns a list of default values.
    """

    # Whatever the fallback strategy is, it should be implemented here.
    # As a placeholder let's say it returns a list of zeros.
    return [0]*10
```

This will automatically call the fallback strategy when no results are found by the backtest function. Please replace it with your actual strategy implementation and your actual backtest function.
