To analyze market trends and identify potential trading opportunities, we can use Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, yfinance to download the stock data, and matplotlib for data visualization. Here is a simple Python script that uses Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to identify potential trading opportunities. 

Please note that this is a very basic form of analysis and real-world trading systems are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def calculate_macd(data, short_window, long_window):
    short_ema = calculate_ema(data, short_window)
    long_ema = calculate_ema(data, long_window)
    macd = short_ema - long_ema
    signal = calculate_ema(macd, 9)
    return macd, signal

def plot_macd(macd, signal, data):
    plt.figure(figsize=(12.2, 4.5))
    plt.plot(data.index, macd, label='AAPL MACD', color = 'red')
    plt.plot(data.index, signal, label='Signal Line', color='blue')
    plt.legend(loc='upper left')
    plt.show()

def analyze_market_trends(symbol):
    df = yf.download(symbol, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')
    df = df['Close']
    macd, signal = calculate_macd(df, 12, 26)
    plot_macd(macd, signal, df)

analyze_market_trends('AAPL')
```

In this script, we first define a function to calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Then we define a function to calculate the MACD line and the signal line. The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-day EMA from the 12-day EMA, and the signal line is a 9-day EMA of the MACD line.

We then define a function to plot the MACD and signal lines.

Finally, we define a function to download the stock data, calculate the MACD and signal lines, and plot them. We call this function with the symbol of the stock we want to analyze.
