Analyzing market trends can involve a variety of techniques, such as analyzing moving averages, volume and momentum, MACD, and other indicators. For simplicity, here is a basic example of how to fetch market data and calculate moving averages using the Python Pandas library and yfinance, a package that allows downloading historical market data from Yahoo Finance:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Define stock ticker symbol
stock = 'AAPL'

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download(stock, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

# Calculate Short Term Moving Average (Example - 20 days)
data['Short_Term_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate Long Term Moving Average (Example - 50 days)
data['Long_Term_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Identify potential trade signals
# Buy Signal - When Short Term MA Crosses above Long Term MA
data['Buy_Signal'] = (data['Short_Term_MA'] > data['Long_Term_MA'])

# Sell Signal - When Short Term MA Crosses below Long Term MA
data['Sell_Signal'] = (data['Short_Term_MA'] < data['Long_Term_MA'])

print(data)
```

This code downloads historical data for Apple Inc. ('AAPL'), calculates moving averages, and identifies when the short term moving average crosses the long term moving average, providing potential buy and sell signals. Remember, this is just an oversimplification of market analysis, real trade decisions should consider further factors and analysis.

Also, keep in mind that this is just historical analysis and that it does not predict future returns. Always use trading strategies with caution, according to risk tolerance and investment goals, and preferably with advice from a certified financial advisor.
