To complete this task, we need to know what kind of trading system we are working with and what kind of data we have access to. However, I can provide a simple example of a Python function that might be used to initiate a trade in a hypothetical trading system.

```python
def initiate_trade(ptm, trade_amount, trade_direction):
    """
    This function initiates a trade in the PTM trading system.

    Parameters:
    ptm (object): The PTM trading system object.
    trade_amount (float): The amount of money to trade.
    trade_direction (str): The direction of the trade, either 'buy' or 'sell'.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the trade was successfully initiated, False otherwise.
    """

    # Check if the trade direction is valid
    if trade_direction not in ['buy', 'sell']:
        print("Invalid trade direction. Please enter 'buy' or 'sell'.")
        return False

    # Check if the trade amount is valid
    if trade_amount <= 0:
        print("Invalid trade amount. Please enter a positive number.")
        return False

    # Try to initiate the trade
    try:
        ptm.initiate_trade(trade_amount, trade_direction)
        print(f"Successfully initiated a {trade_direction} trade for ${trade_amount}.")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to initiate trade: {e}")
        return False
```

In this example, `ptm` is an object that represents the trading system. The `initiate_trade` method of this object is used to initiate a trade. The `trade_amount` parameter is the amount of money to trade and `trade_direction` is the direction of the trade, either 'buy' or 'sell'. The function checks if the input parameters are valid and then tries to initiate the trade. If the trade is successfully initiated, the function returns `True`; if not, it returns `False`.

Please note that this is a very simplified example. In a real-world trading system, the trading logic would be much more complex and would likely involve analyzing market data to determine the optimal trade amount and direction.
