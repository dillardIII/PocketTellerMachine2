Sure, here is a simple Python code to simulate a trade initiation. Please note that this is a simplified version and actual trading system involves complex algorithms, real-time data, and secure connections.

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, symbol, volume):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.volume = volume

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []

    def initiate_trade(self, trade):
        self.trades.append(trade)
        print(f"Trade initiated: {trade.symbol} for volume {trade.volume}")

    def get_market_trends(self):
        # This is a simplified version. In real world, you would use real-time market data to analyze trends.
        trends = {trade.symbol: random.choice(['up', 'down']) for trade in self.trades}
        return trends

# Create PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
trade = Trade('AAPL', 100)
ptm.initiate_trade(trade)

# Get market trends
trends = ptm.get_market_trends()
print(trends)
```

In this code, we have a `Trade` class to represent a trade and a `PTM` class to represent the trading system. The `PTM` class has a method `initiate_trade` to initiate a trade and a method `get_market_trends` to get market trends. The `get_market_trends` method is a simplified version and it randomly assigns 'up' or 'down' trend to each symbol. In real world, you would use real-time market data to analyze trends.
