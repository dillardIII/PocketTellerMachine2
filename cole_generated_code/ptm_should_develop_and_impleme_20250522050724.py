To develop and implement new trading strategies, we need to use a combination of data analysis, machine learning, and algorithmic trading. Here is a simple example of how we could do this in Python. Please note that this is a simplified example and real-world trading strategies would be much more complex and would require a deep understanding of financial markets.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Load trading data
data = pd.read_csv('trading_data.csv')

# Select features and target
features = ['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3', 'feature4']
target = 'trade_activity'

X = data[features]
y = data[target]

# Split data into training and validation data
train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=1)

# Define the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=1)

# Fit the model
model.fit(train_X, train_y)

# Make validation predictions
val_predictions = model.predict(val_X)

# Calculate mean absolute error
mae = mean_absolute_error(val_predictions, val_y)

print("Validation MAE: {:,.0f}".format(mae))

# Implement the new trading strategy based on the model predictions
data['predicted_trade_activity'] = model.predict(X)

# Increase trade activity if the predicted trade activity is high
data['new_strategy'] = data.apply(lambda row: 'Increase' if row.predicted_trade_activity > row.trade_activity else 'Decrease', axis=1)

# Save the new trading strategy
data.to_csv('new_trading_strategy.csv', index=False)
```

This code loads trading data, selects features and the target, splits the data into training and validation data, defines a Random Forest model, fits the model, makes validation predictions, calculates the mean absolute error of the predictions, implements a new trading strategy based on the model predictions, and saves the new trading strategy.

The new trading strategy increases trade activity if the predicted trade activity is higher than the current trade activity, and decreases trade activity otherwise. This strategy assumes that higher trade activity is better, which may not always be the case.
