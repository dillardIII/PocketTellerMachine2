As an AI language model, I can provide a basic example of how you might structure a Python code to review and adjust trading strategies. However, please note that this is a simplified version and real-world trading strategies involve complex algorithms, real-time data analysis, and various financial indicators.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Assuming we have a CSV file with historical trading data
data = pd.read_csv('historical_trading_data.csv')

# Let's say we have 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close' prices and 'Volume' as features
# And 'Buy' (1 for buy, 0 for not buy) as target
features = data[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume']]
target = data['Buy']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
features_train, features_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2)

# Use a Random Forest Classifier as our trading strategy
strategy = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
strategy.fit(features_train, target_train)

# Predict the 'Buy' signals for our test set
predictions = strategy.predict(features_test)

# Review our strategy by checking the accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(target_test, predictions)
print(f'Strategy Accuracy: {accuracy * 100}%')

# If accuracy is not satisfactory, we can adjust our strategy, for example, by tuning the parameters of our model
strategy_adjusted = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=200, max_depth=10)
strategy_adjusted.fit(features_train, target_train)

# Predict the 'Buy' signals for our test set using the adjusted strategy
predictions_adjusted = strategy_adjusted.predict(features_test)

# Review our adjusted strategy
accuracy_adjusted = accuracy_score(target_test, predictions_adjusted)
print(f'Adjusted Strategy Accuracy: {accuracy_adjusted * 100}%')
```

This example uses a Random Forest Classifier as a trading strategy. The strategy is reviewed by checking its accuracy on a test set. If the accuracy is not satisfactory, the strategy is adjusted by tuning the parameters of the model. The adjusted strategy is then reviewed again.
