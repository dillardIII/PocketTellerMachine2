To increase trading activity, we can create a Python script that will automate trading operations. Here's a simple example using a fictional trading API:

```python
import random
import time
from trading_api import place_order  # Assuming we have a trading API with a function place_order

# Define the stocks we are interested in
stocks = ['AAPL', 'GOOG', 'TSLA', 'MSFT', 'AMZN']

def automated_trading():
    while True:
        # Randomly select a stock
        stock = random.choice(stocks)

        # Randomly decide whether to buy or sell
        action = random.choice(['buy', 'sell'])

        # Randomly decide the amount of shares to buy/sell (1 to 10 for this example)
        amount = random.randint(1, 10)

        # Place the order
        place_order(stock, action, amount)

        # Wait for a random amount of time before the next trade (1 to 60 seconds for this example)
        time.sleep(random.randint(1, 60))

# Start automated trading
automated_trading()
```

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading bots are much more complex. They take into account various factors like market trends, current portfolio, risk management strategies etc. Also, please replace the `trading_api` and `place_order` with your actual trading API and function.

This script will continuously place random buy and sell orders for the specified stocks, which should increase trading activity. However, it's important to remember that this could also increase risk, as the script doesn't take into account any trading strategies or risk management.
