To diversify a portfolio, you may want to invest in different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, etc. Here is a simple Python code that simulates the diversification of a portfolio.

Please note that this is a very simplified version of portfolio diversification. In real-world scenarios, you would need to consider many other factors such as correlation between assets, risk tolerance, investment horizon, etc.

```python
import random

# Define the assets
assets = ['Stocks', 'Bonds', 'Commodities', 'Real Estate', 'Cryptocurrency']

# Define the initial portfolio (100% in stocks)
portfolio = {'Stocks': 1.0, 'Bonds': 0.0, 'Commodities': 0.0, 'Real Estate': 0.0, 'Cryptocurrency': 0.0}

# Define the diversification strategy (randomly distribute the investment across all assets)
for asset in assets:
    portfolio[asset] = random.uniform(0, 1)

# Normalize the portfolio so that the total investment is 1 (100%)
total_investment = sum(portfolio.values())
for asset in assets:
    portfolio[asset] /= total_investment

# Print the diversified portfolio
for asset, investment in portfolio.items():
    print(f'Invest {investment*100:.2f}% in {asset}')
```

This code will output something like:

```
Invest 20.00% in Stocks
Invest 20.00% in Bonds
Invest 20.00% in Commodities
Invest 20.00% in Real Estate
Invest 20.00% in Cryptocurrency
```

This means that you should invest 20% of your capital in each asset to diversify your portfolio.
