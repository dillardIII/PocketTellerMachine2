Here is a Python code to implement a fallback strategy for backtesting results:

```python
# Example code of a function named "get_backtest_results"
# This function tries to get backtest results and if they are not available, it falls back to an alternative strategy

def get_backtest_results():
    backtest_results = None  # replace this with your actual function to get backtest results
    
    if not backtest_results:
        print("Backtest results not found, applying fallback strategy...")
        fallback_strategy()  # call the fallback strategy
    else:
        return backtest_results

# Example code of a function named "fallback_strategy"
# This function executes when the main backtest results can't be found

def fallback_strategy():
    # Example: if the backtest results are not found, use an alternative strategy, e.g., buy index ETF
    print("Fallback strategy: Buy and Hold Index ETF")

    # Implement the actual fallback strategy code here
```

Remember to replace the dummy code and comments with the actual implementation according to your needs. The fallback_strategy function is just a placeholder; you should put your actual alternative strategy code in this function.
