To complete this task, we would need a lot more information and resources than provided. However, I can give you a simple example of how you might start to structure such a program using Python. This example uses the pandas library to analyze market trends.

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data as web

def calculate_trend(data):
    # This is a simple trend calculation, you might want to use a more sophisticated algorithm
    return data['Close'].rolling(window=30).mean()

def adjust_strategy(trend):
    if trend[-1] > trend[-2]:
        return 'Buy'
    else:
        return 'Sell'

def main():
    # Get market data for the last 60 days
    data = web.DataReader('AAPL', 'yahoo', start='01/01/2020', end='01/31/2020')
    
    # Calculate the trend
    trend = calculate_trend(data)
    
    # Adjust the strategy based on the trend
    strategy = adjust_strategy(trend)
    
    print(f'The current strategy is: {strategy}')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This is a very basic example and doesn't actually trade any stocks. It's just a starting point. For a real trading bot, you would need to integrate with a trading platform API, handle a lot more edge cases, and probably use a more sophisticated algorithm to analyze market trends and adjust your trading strategy. You would also need to handle things like risk management, transaction costs, and many other factors.
