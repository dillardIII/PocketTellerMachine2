To conduct a market analysis, we would need to fetch data from a market data source. For this example, let's use Yahoo Finance data and the `yfinance` library in Python. We'll also use `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib` for data visualization.

Please note that this is a very basic analysis and does not take into account many factors that could influence trading decisions.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the list of stocks we are interested in
stocks = ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'FB']

# Fetch data for the past 30 days
data = yf.download(stocks, period='1mo')

# Calculate the daily returns
data['Daily Return'] = data['Adj Close'].pct_change()

# Plot the daily returns
data['Daily Return'].plot(figsize=(15, 7))
plt.title('Daily Returns')
plt.show()

# Identify potential trading opportunities
# Here we consider a stock as a potential trading opportunity if its daily return is more than 2%
opportunities = data[data['Daily Return'] > 0.02]

print("Potential trading opportunities for the next day:")
for stock in opportunities:
    print(stock)
```

This script will fetch the past 30 days of data for the stocks we are interested in, calculate the daily returns, and then identify any stocks that have had a daily return of more than 2%. It will then print out these stocks as potential trading opportunities for the next day.

Please note that this is a very basic analysis and does not take into account many factors that could influence trading decisions. Always conduct thorough research and consider seeking advice from a financial advisor before making any trading decisions.
