Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet implementing a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that you have a function `run_backtest()` that runs a backtest and returns the results, or `None` if no results are found.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function should run a backtest and return the results
    # Return None if no results are found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement your fallback strategy
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")

def main():
    backtest_results = run_backtest()
    if backtest_results is None:
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found. Proceeding with normal strategy.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` is called and its results are stored in `backtest_results`. If `backtest_results` is `None` (indicating that no backtest results were found), then the `fallback_strategy()` function is called. Otherwise, a message is printed indicating that backtest results were found and the normal strategy will proceed. 

You will need to replace `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` with your actual backtest and fallback strategy implementations.
