The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. Here is a simple Python code to generate an RSI strategy using the `pandas` and `yfinance` libraries.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_rsi(data, window):
    delta = data.diff()
    up, down = delta.copy(), delta.copy()
    up[up < 0] = 0
    down[down > 0] = 0

    average_gain = up.rolling(window).mean()
    average_loss = abs(down.rolling(window).mean())

    rs = average_gain / average_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi

def rsi_strategy(data, window=14):
    rsi = calculate_rsi(data['Close'], window)
    data['RSI'] = rsi

    buy_signals, sell_signals = [], []

    for i in range(len(data)):
        if data['RSI'].iloc[i] < 30:  # oversold condition
            buy_signals.append(data['Close'].iloc[i])
            sell_signals.append(float('nan'))
        elif data['RSI'].iloc[i] > 70:  # overbought condition
            sell_signals.append(data['Close'].iloc[i])
            buy_signals.append(float('nan'))
        else:
            buy_signals.append(float('nan'))
            sell_signals.append(float('nan'))

    return buy_signals, sell_signals

ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

buy_signals, sell_signals = rsi_strategy(data)

data['Buy_Signal_Price'] = buy_signals
data['Sell_Signal_Price'] = sell_signals

print(data)
```

This code downloads historical data for a specific ticker symbol (in this case, 'AAPL' for Apple Inc.) from Yahoo Finance. It then calculates the RSI for the closing prices over a specified window (default is 14 days, as is commonly used). If the RSI is below 30, it indicates an oversold condition and a buy signal is generated. If the RSI is above 70, it indicates an overbought condition and a sell signal is generated. The buy and sell signal prices are then added to the data frame.
