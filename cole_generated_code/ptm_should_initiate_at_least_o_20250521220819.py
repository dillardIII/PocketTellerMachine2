Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that simulates a trading bot. It uses random numbers to simulate wins and losses. Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading bots use complex algorithms and real-time data to make decisions.

```python
import random

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []
        self.wins = 0
        self.losses = 0

    def initiate_trade(self):
        # Simulate a trade with random outcome
        outcome = random.choice(['win', 'loss'])
        self.trades.append(outcome)

        if outcome == 'win':
            self.wins += 1
        else:
            self.losses += 1

        return outcome

# Create a PTM instance
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate a trade
trade_outcome = ptm.initiate_trade()

print(f"Trade outcome: {trade_outcome}")
print(f"Total trades: {len(ptm.trades)}")
print(f"Wins: {ptm.wins}")
print(f"Losses: {ptm.losses}")
```

This code creates a `PTM` class that has methods for initiating trades and keeping track of wins and losses. When a trade is initiated, it randomly chooses between a win or a loss. The outcome of the trade is then added to the list of trades and the number of wins or losses is updated accordingly. Finally, it prints the outcome of the trade and the total number of trades, wins, and losses.
