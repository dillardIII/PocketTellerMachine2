To complete this task, you would need to use machine learning and data analysis libraries in Python such as pandas, numpy, and sklearn. However, please note that this is a simplified version of a trading bot and it may not work in a real-world scenario as it is. 

Here is a basic example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Select the features and target
features = ['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume']
target = 'Close'
X = data[features]
y = data[target]

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the mean absolute error
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)

print(f'Mean Absolute Error: {mae}')

# Identify potential winning trades
potential_trades = X_test[predictions > y_test]
print('Potential winning trades:')
print(potential_trades)
```

In this code, we load the market data from a CSV file, select the features and target for our model, split the data into training and test sets, train a random forest regressor model, make predictions, calculate the mean absolute error of the predictions, and identify potential winning trades where the predicted closing price is higher than the actual closing price.

Please note that you need to have a CSV file named 'market_data.csv' with 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume', and 'Close' columns for this code to work. Also, this is a very simplified model and might not give accurate predictions for real-world trading. You might need to use more complex models and more features for better predictions.
