As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I can't conduct real-time market research or execute trades. However, I can provide a basic example of how you might use Python to analyze historical market data. 

You could use the `pandas` library to analyze data, and `yfinance` to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance. Here's a simple example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-1-25')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# You can perform various statistical or financial analyses on this data to identify potential trading opportunities.
```

This code will print out a dataframe with the open, high, low, close, volume, dividends, and stock splits for each day between the start and end dates.

Please note that this is a very basic example. Real-world market research and trading involves much more complex analyses and considerations of many other factors.

Also, remember to replace `'AAPL'` with the ticker symbol of the stock you are interested in.
