Sure, here's a simple way to implement a fallback strategy using Python. In this example, I'm assuming that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that runs your backtest and returns the results. If no results are found, it returns `None`.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # Your backtest code here
    # Return the results or None if no results found
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # Your fallback strategy code here
    pass

# Run the backtest
backtest_results = run_backtest()

# Check if the backtest returned results
if backtest_results is None:
    # If no results, run the fallback strategy
    print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy.")
    fallback_strategy()
else:
    # If results found, proceed as normal
    print("Backtest results found.")
    # Your code to handle the backtest results here
```

In this code, `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` are placeholder functions. You would replace them with your actual backtest and fallback strategy code. The `if` statement checks if `run_backtest()` returned `None`, and if so, it runs the fallback strategy. If `run_backtest()` returned results, it proceeds as normal.
