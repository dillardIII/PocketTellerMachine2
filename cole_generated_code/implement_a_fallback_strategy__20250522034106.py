Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. This code assumes that you have a function named `run_backtest()` that returns the backtest results and `fallback_strategy()` that will be executed when no backtest results are found.

```python
def get_backtest_results():
    # Run the backtest
    results = run_backtest()

    # Check if the results are empty
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy...")
        # Run the fallback strategy
        fallback_results = fallback_strategy()
        return fallback_results

    return results

def run_backtest():
    # This is a placeholder for your actual backtest function
    # It should return the results of the backtest
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is a placeholder for your actual fallback strategy function
    # It should return the results of the fallback strategy
    pass
```

Please replace the `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` functions with your actual functions. The `get_backtest_results()` function will first try to get the backtest results, and if it doesn't find any, it will run the fallback strategy.
