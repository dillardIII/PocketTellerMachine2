To initiate a trade and gain insights on market trends, we would need to use an API that allows us to interact with the market. For this example, I'll use the Alpaca API, a commission-free API for trading. 

Please note that you need to replace `YOUR_API_KEY_ID` and `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your actual Alpaca API key and secret key. Also, this is a simple example of initiating a trade, you should implement more complex strategies and error handling in a real-world scenario.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

api = tradeapi.REST('YOUR_API_KEY_ID', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Get daily price data for AAPL over the last 5 trading days.
barset = api.get_barset('AAPL', 'day', limit=5)
aapl_bars = barset['AAPL']

# See how much AAPL moved in that timeframe.
week_open = aapl_bars[0].o
week_close = aapl_bars[-1].c
percent_change = (week_close - week_open) / week_open * 100
print('AAPL moved {}% over the last 5 days'.format(percent_change))

# Decide whether to buy or sell
if percent_change < 0:
    api.submit_order(
        symbol='AAPL',
        qty=1,
        side='buy',
        type='market',
        time_in_force='gtc'
    )
    print('Bought 1 share of AAPL')
else:
    print('AAPL is not in a good position to buy')
```

This script checks the price of AAPL over the last 5 trading days. If the price has decreased, it initiates a trade to buy 1 share of AAPL. If the price has increased, it does not initiate a trade. This is a very simple strategy and is just for demonstration purposes. 

Please note that trading involves risk, and this script does not account for many important factors such as risk management, diversification, etc. Always do your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before trading.
