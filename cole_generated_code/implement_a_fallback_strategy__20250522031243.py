Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found:

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Run the backtest for the given strategy
    backtest_results = strategy.run_backtest()

    # If no results are found, run the fallback strategy
    if not backtest_results:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")
        fallback_strategy = FallbackStrategy()
        fallback_results = fallback_strategy.run_backtest()

        # If still no results, raise an exception
        if not fallback_results:
            raise Exception("No results found even with fallback strategy.")
        else:
            return fallback_results

    return backtest_results
```

In this code, `strategy` and `FallbackStrategy` are placeholders. You would replace them with your actual strategy and fallback strategy classes or functions. The `run_backtest` method is also a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual method you use to run backtests.

Please note that this is a very basic example. The actual implementation would depend on the specifics of your backtesting system and trading strategies.
