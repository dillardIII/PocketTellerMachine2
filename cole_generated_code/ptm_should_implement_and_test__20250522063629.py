Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a basic trading strategy. This strategy is based on moving averages. When the short-term average is greater than the long-term average, it's a signal to buy. When the short-term average is less than the long-term average, it's a signal to sell.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assuming we have a DataFrame 'df' with 'Close' prices
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Close': np.random.randn(100)  # Random data
})

# Define the short and long windows
short_window = 10
long_window = 30

# Initialize the `signals` DataFrame with the `signal` column
df['signal'] = 0.0

# Create short simple moving average over the short window
df['short_mavg'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

# Create long simple moving average over the long window
df['long_mavg'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

# Create signals
df['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(df['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                        > df['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   

# Generate trading orders
df['positions'] = df['signal'].diff()

# Print `df`
print(df)
```

In this code, we first calculate the short and long moving averages. Then, we generate signals where we mark 1.0 for the period where the short moving average is greater than the long moving average (indicating a buy signal) and 0.0 otherwise (indicating a sell signal). We then generate trading orders based on these signals.

Please note that this is a very simple trading strategy and is used just for demonstration. Real-world trading strategies can be much more complex and take into account many other factors.
