Here is a simple Python code that uses the yfinance library to download stock data and pandas to analyze it. This code identifies potential trading opportunities by looking for stocks whose 50-day moving average has recently crossed above their 200-day moving average, a bullish signal in technical analysis known as a "golden cross".

Please note that this is a very basic form of market analysis and should not be used for actual trading decisions without further refinement and testing.

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Define the list of stocks we want to analyze
stocks = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'FB']

# Create an empty DataFrame to store the stock data
df = pd.DataFrame()

# Download the stock data and calculate the moving averages
for stock in stocks:
    data = yf.download(stock, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')
    data['50_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
    data['200_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()
    data['Symbol'] = stock
    df = df.append(data)

# Identify potential trading opportunities
df['Golden_Cross'] = df['50_MA'] > df['200_MA']
crosses = df[df['Golden_Cross'] == True]

# Print the potential trading opportunities
print(crosses)
```

This code will print out a DataFrame containing all the days on which a golden cross occurred for each stock in the list. You could further refine this to only show the most recent golden cross for each stock, or to filter out stocks based on other criteria.
