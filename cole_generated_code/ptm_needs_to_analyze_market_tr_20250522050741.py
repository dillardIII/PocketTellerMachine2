This task requires a lot of data and complex analysis which is beyond the scope of a simple Python script. However, I can provide a basic example of how you might start to approach this problem using Python and pandas, a popular data analysis library.

First, you would need to get the market data. There are many ways to do this, but one common method is to use a service like Alpha Vantage, which provides a free API for accessing market data.

Here's a simple example of how you might use this service to get the daily stock data for a specific company and calculate its moving average, which is a common indicator used in trading:

```python
import pandas as pd
import requests
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual Alpha Vantage API key
API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

def get_daily_data(symbol):
    base_url = 'https://www.alphavantage.co/query'
    params = {
        'function': 'TIME_SERIES_DAILY',
        'symbol': symbol,
        'outputsize': 'full',
        'apikey': API_KEY,
    }
    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)
    data = response.json()
    df = pd.DataFrame(data['Time Series (Daily)']).T
    df = df.rename(columns={'1. open': 'open', '2. high': 'high', '3. low': 'low', '4. close': 'close', '5. volume': 'volume'})
    for col in df.columns:
        df[col] = pd.to_numeric(df[col])
    return df

def calculate_moving_average(df, window):
    return df['close'].rolling(window=window).mean()

def plot_data(df, symbol):
    plt.figure(figsize=(14,7))
    plt.plot(df['close'], label=f'{symbol} Close Price')
    plt.plot(calculate_moving_average(df, 50), label='50 Day MA')
    plt.plot(calculate_moving_average(df, 200), label='200 Day MA')
    plt.title(f'{symbol} Close Price and Moving Averages')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

# Get the data for a specific company
df = get_daily_data('AAPL')

# Plot the data
plot_data(df, 'AAPL')
```

This is a very basic example and real trading algorithms would be much more complex, taking into account many different factors and using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.
