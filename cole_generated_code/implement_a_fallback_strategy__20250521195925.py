Here's a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. The fallback strategy could be anything as per your requirement. In this example, I am just printing a message and returning an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest_strategy():
    # Assuming that get_backtest_results is a function that returns backtest results
    backtest_results = get_backtest_results()

    if not backtest_results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Implement your fallback strategy here
        # For now, just returning an empty dictionary
        return {}

    return backtest_results
```

In this code, `get_backtest_results()` is a hypothetical function that should return the backtest results. If it returns an empty result (which could be an empty list, None, etc.), then the fallback strategy is implemented. The fallback strategy could be anything - like using a default set of results, running a different strategy, etc. For simplicity, I'm just printing a message and returning an empty dictionary. You should replace this with your actual fallback strategy.
