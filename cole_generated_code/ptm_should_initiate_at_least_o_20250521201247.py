Sure, here's a simple Python code using `yfinance` library to download stock data and initiate a trade. Please note that this is a simulation and doesn't actually perform any real trading.

```python
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define the stock to trade
stock_symbol = 'AAPL'

# Define the amount to trade
trade_amount = 1

# Download stock data
data = yf.download(stock_symbol, start=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30), end=datetime.now())

# Get the latest closing price
latest_close = data['Close'][-1]

# Simulate a buy trade
print(f"Buying {trade_amount} of {stock_symbol} at {latest_close}")

# Store the trade in a dictionary
trade = {
    'symbol': stock_symbol,
    'amount': trade_amount,
    'price': latest_close,
    'type': 'buy',
    'date': datetime.now()
}

print(trade)
```

This code downloads the last 30 days of data for the Apple stock (AAPL), gets the latest closing price, and simulates a buy trade of 1 unit at that price. The trade is then stored in a dictionary for later use.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading involves a lot more complexity including but not limited to risk management, order types, market depth analysis etc. Also, you should never trade with money you can't afford to lose.
