Writing a Python code for analyzing market trends and indicators is a complex task and requires a good understanding of both finance and programming. Here's a simple example of how you might start to build such a system using Python and the pandas library. This is a very basic example and real-world trading systems are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as web
import datetime as dt

# Define the start and end dates
start = dt.datetime(2020,1,1)
end = dt.datetime.now()

# Get the stock data
df = web.DataReader('AAPL', 'yahoo', start, end)

# Calculate the moving averages
df['MA10'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
df['MA50'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# A simple strategy: buy when the 10-day MA is above the 50-day MA
df['Buy_Signal'] = df['MA10'] > df['MA50']

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```

This script gets the historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance, calculates the 10-day and 50-day moving averages (MAs), and generates a buy signal whenever the 10-day MA is above the 50-day MA.

Please note that this is a very simplistic strategy and is unlikely to be profitable in the real world. A real trading system would need to consider many other factors, such as transaction costs, risk management, other technical indicators, fundamental analysis, etc. Also, it's important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.
