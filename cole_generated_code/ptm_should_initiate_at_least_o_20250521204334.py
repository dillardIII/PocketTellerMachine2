Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade. This code does not connect to any real trading platform, it's just a simulation.

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, stock, quantity, buy_price, sell_price):
        self.stock = stock
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.buy_price = buy_price
        self.sell_price = sell_price

    def calculate_profit(self):
        return (self.sell_price - self.buy_price) * self.quantity

def initiate_trade():
    # Simulate stock price
    buy_price = random.uniform(10.0, 50.0)
    sell_price = random.uniform(10.0, 50.0)

    # Simulate quantity
    quantity = random.randint(1, 100)

    # Simulate stock
    stock = "PTM"

    # Create trade
    trade = Trade(stock, quantity, buy_price, sell_price)

    # Calculate profit
    profit = trade.calculate_profit()

    return trade, profit

trade, profit = initiate_trade()

print(f"Trade initiated for {trade.stock} with quantity {trade.quantity} at buy price {trade.buy_price} and sell price {trade.sell_price}.")
print(f"Profit from this trade: {profit}")
```

This code initiates a trade for a stock named "PTM". The buy and sell prices, as well as the quantity, are randomly generated. The profit from the trade is calculated as the difference between the sell price and the buy price, multiplied by the quantity.
