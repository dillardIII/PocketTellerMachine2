While your request is clear, Python code for trading requires detailed information such as trading signal, algorithm being used, etc. Also, increasing trading frequency might not always boost chances of winning since it can also increase the risk. 

However, here is a simple example of how you could increase trading frequency in a dummy trading bot by decreasing the time between each trade. In this example, I'm using the time library.

Please note, this code is an oversimplified example and does not involve actual trading logic. It only serves the purpose of showing how to increase frequency:

```python
import time

def make_trade():
    """
    Dummy function. Add your trading logic here.
    """
    print("Trade executed")

# Let's suppose you were making a trade every 60 seconds.

print("Trading every 60 seconds:")
for _ in range(10):
    make_trade()
    time.sleep(60)

# To boost trading frequency, you decrease the time between trades. 
# Let's say you now make a trade every 30 seconds.

print("Trading every 30 seconds:")
for _ in range(20):  # Trading twice as frequently, so do 20 iterations as well.
    make_trade()
    time.sleep(30)
```
Remember, implement the actual trading logic inside `make_trade()`. Also, you should respect the rate limits of whatever trading API you're using - they may not allow you to make requests as frequently as you'd like.
