Here's a simple implementation of a fallback strategy in Python. This is a very basic example and the actual implementation would depend on the specifics of your trading system and what you would want to do when no backtest results are found.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume this function runs the backtest and returns the results
    # If no results are found, it returns None
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is the fallback strategy that will be used when no backtest results are found
    # The implementation of this would depend on your trading system
    print("Running fallback strategy...")

def run_strategy(strategy):
    results = backtest_strategy(strategy)
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Running fallback strategy...")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # If backtest results are found, continue with the original strategy
        print("Backtest results found. Continuing with original strategy...")
        # Continue with the original strategy...

# Run the strategy
run_strategy("my_strategy")
```

In this code, `backtest_strategy()` is a placeholder function that is supposed to run the backtest and return the results. If no results are found, it returns `None`. When `run_strategy()` is called, it first tries to run the backtest. If no results are found, it calls `fallback_strategy()`. If results are found, it continues with the original strategy. The actual implementation of `fallback_strategy()` would depend on your trading system and what you would want to do when no backtest results are found.
