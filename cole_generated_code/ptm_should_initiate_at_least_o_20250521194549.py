Sure, here is a simple example of a Python code that uses the Alpaca API to initiate a trade. Please note that you need to replace 'APCA-API-KEY-ID' and 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY' with your actual Alpaca API key and secret.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Setup
api = tradeapi.REST('APCA-API-KEY-ID', 'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Check if the market is open
clock = api.get_clock()
if clock.is_open:
    # Initiate a trade
    api.submit_order(
        symbol='AAPL',
        qty=1,
        side='buy',
        type='market',
        time_in_force='gtc'
    )
else:
    print("The market is closed")
```

This script checks if the market is open and if it is, it initiates a trade to buy 1 share of AAPL at the current market price. If the market is closed, it prints a message saying "The market is closed".

Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading algorithms can be much more complex. Also, keep in mind that trading involves risk and you should only trade with money you can afford to lose.
