Sure, here's a simple way to implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this example, I'll assume that the backtest results are obtained from a function called `run_backtest()`, and the fallback strategy is another function called `fallback_strategy()`.

```python
def run_backtest():
    # This function should return the backtest results if they exist
    # If no results are found, it should return None
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This function should implement the fallback strategy
    pass

def main():
    results = run_backtest()
    if results is None:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        print("Backtest results found.")
        # Process the results

main()
```

This code checks if the `run_backtest()` function returns any results. If it doesn't (i.e., it returns `None`), it calls the `fallback_strategy()` function. If it does return results, it proceeds to process those results. 

Please replace the `pass` in `run_backtest()` and `fallback_strategy()` functions with your actual code.
