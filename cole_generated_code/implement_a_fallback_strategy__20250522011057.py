Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet implementing a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. In this case, the fallback strategy is to print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    # Assume we have a function `run_backtest` that runs the backtest and returns the results
    backtest_results = run_backtest(strategy)

    # Check if the backtest results are empty
    if not backtest_results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Fallback strategy: return an empty dictionary
        return {}

    # If backtest results are found, return them
    return backtest_results
```

The above code assumes that the `run_backtest` function runs the backtest and returns the results. If no results are found (i.e., the results are empty), it implements a fallback strategy of returning an empty dictionary.

Please note that the actual implementation of the fallback strategy will depend on the specific requirements of your trading system. The above is just a simple example.
