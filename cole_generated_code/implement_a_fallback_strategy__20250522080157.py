Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. 

```python
def backtest(strategy):
    # Run backtest
    results = strategy.run_backtest()

    # Check if results are empty
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        # Implement fallback strategy
        fallback_strategy = FallbackStrategy()
        fallback_results = fallback_strategy.run_backtest()

        # Check if fallback results are empty
        if not fallback_results:
            print("No results found with fallback strategy. Please check your data or strategy.")
        else:
            print("Fallback strategy results:")
            for result in fallback_results:
                print(result)
    else:
        print("Backtest results:")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

# Replace with your strategy
strategy = Strategy()
backtest(strategy)
```

Please note that this is a simple example and may need to be adjusted to fit your specific needs. The `Strategy` and `FallbackStrategy` classes are placeholders and should be replaced with your actual strategy classes. The `run_backtest` method is also a placeholder and should be replaced with the method you use to run your backtests.
