Your request is quite broad and it's not clear what kind of diversification you're looking for. However, I can provide a simple example of how you might diversify a portfolio using Python.

This example will use the `yfinance` package to download stock data, and the `pypfopt` package to perform portfolio optimization. We'll create a portfolio of 5 stocks and use the Efficient Frontier method to diversify.

```python
import yfinance as yf
from pypfopt.efficient_frontier import EfficientFrontier
from pypfopt import risk_models
from pypfopt import expected_returns

# Define the tickers of the stocks we're interested in
tickers = ["AAPL", "GOOGL", "TSLA", "AMZN", "MSFT"]

# Download stock data
data = yf.download(tickers, start="2020-01-01", end="2022-12-31")

# Calculate expected returns and the covariance matrix of returns
mu = expected_returns.mean_historical_return(data)
S = risk_models.sample_cov(data)

# Optimize for the maximal Sharpe ratio
ef = EfficientFrontier(mu, S)
weights = ef.max_sharpe()

# Get the discrete allocation of each share per stock
latest_prices = yf.download(tickers, period="1d")['Close']
weights = ef.clean_weights()
portfolio = ef.portfolio_performance(verbose=True)

# Print the weights of stocks in the portfolio
print(weights)
```

This code will output the weights of each stock in the portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio, which is a measure of return adjusted for risk. This is just one way to diversify a portfolio, and the specific method of diversification will depend on your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real portfolio diversification involves a lot more factors and careful consideration. Also, you need to install the necessary packages by using pip install yfinance and pip install PyPortfolioOpt.
