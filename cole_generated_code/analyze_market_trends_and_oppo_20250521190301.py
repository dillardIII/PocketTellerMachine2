Analyzing market trends and opportunities for potential trades involves complex data analysis and machine learning algorithms. Here is a simple Python code using pandas and yfinance libraries to fetch historical data of a particular stock and analyze it:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL','2020-01-01','2022-12-31')

# Calculate moving average
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Plotting the data
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price')
plt.plot(data['SMA_50'], label='50-day moving average')
plt.plot(data['SMA_200'], label='200-day moving average')
plt.title('Historical Stock Value')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Stock Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Simple prediction model
X = data['Close'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = data['SMA_50'].values.reshape(-1,1)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

regressor = LinearRegression()  
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train) #training the algorithm

# Predicting the future trend
y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)

# Comparing Actual vs Predicted
df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test.flatten(), 'Predicted': y_pred.flatten()})
print(df)
```

This code fetches historical data for Apple Inc. from Yahoo Finance, calculates 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and plots them. It also uses a simple linear regression model to predict future trends. However, for a real-world trading system, you would need a much more sophisticated model, possibly involving machine learning and deep learning techniques.
