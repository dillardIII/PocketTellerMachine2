Sure, I will provide an example of a simple Python script that uses the `pandas` library to analyze historical market data. This script will calculate the moving average of a stock's price and use it to identify potential profitable trades. Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as web
import datetime

# Define the stock to analyze
stock = 'AAPL'

# Define the date range of the historical data
start_date = datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=365)
end_date = datetime.datetime.now()

# Download the historical data
df = web.DataReader(stock, 'yahoo', start_date, end_date)

# Calculate the 50-day moving average
df['50_MA'] = df['Adj Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Calculate the 200-day moving average
df['200_MA'] = df['Adj Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Create a signal when the 50-day moving average is higher than the 200-day moving average
df['Signal'] = 0.0  
df['Signal'][df['50_MA'] > df['200_MA']] = 1.0

# Identify potential trades for the next day
df['Position'] = df['Signal'].diff()

# Print potential trades
print(df[df['Position'] == 1.0])
```

This script identifies "buy" signals, which occur when the 50-day moving average of the stock's price is higher than the 200-day moving average. This is a common trading strategy known as a "golden cross". When this condition is met, the script suggests that it might be a good time to buy the stock.

Please note that this script requires the `pandas`, `pandas_datareader`, and `datetime` libraries. Also, you need to replace `'AAPL'` with the ticker symbol of the stock you want to analyze.

This is a very basic example and real-world trading algorithms are much more complex and take into account many more factors. Always do your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making trading decisions.
