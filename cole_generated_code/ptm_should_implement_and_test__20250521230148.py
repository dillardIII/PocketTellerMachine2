Sure, I can provide a simple implementation of a moving average crossover strategy using Python. This is a common strategy used in algorithmic trading where you maintain a short term and long term moving average of a stock price, and make trades based on when these averages cross over each other. 

Please note that this is a very simplified version of a trading bot and it's recommended to use more sophisticated strategies and risk management for actual trading. Also, you need to install `pandas`, `yfinance`, `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries to run this code.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    return data.rolling(window=window).mean()

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def implement_strategy(data):
    # Calculate short term and long term moving averages
    data['short_term_ma'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], 20)
    data['long_term_ma'] = calculate_sma(data['Close'], 100)

    # Create a column 'Signal' such that if short term MA is greater than long term MA then Signal is 1 else 0
    data['Signal'] = 0.0  
    data['Signal'][short_term_ma > long_term_ma] = 1.0

    # Create a column 'Position' which is the difference of present and previous day's 'Signal'
    data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

    return data

def plot_graph(data):
    # Plot the closing price, short term and long term moving averages 
    data[['Close', 'short_term_ma', 'long_term_ma']].plot(figsize=(10,5))
    plt.show()

    # Plot 'Buy' signals
    plt.plot(data[data['Position'] == 1].index, 
             data['short_term_ma'][data['Position'] == 1], 
             '^', markersize=10, color='g')

    # Plot 'Sell' signals
    plt.plot(data[data['Position'] == -1].index, 
             data['short_term_ma'][data['Position'] == -1], 
             'v', markersize=10, color='r')
    plt.show()

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL','2019-1-1','2022-12-31')

# Implement the strategy
data = implement_strategy(data)

# Plot the graph
plot_graph(data)
```

This script downloads historical price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance, calculates the short term (20 days) and long term (100 days) moving averages, and generates trading signals based on these moving averages. It then plots the closing price, moving averages and trading signals on a graph. 

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and is not guaranteed to make profit. It's always recommended to backtest any strategy extensively before live trading.
