Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code for a trading strategy. This example uses a simple moving average crossover strategy. Please note that this is a very basic strategy and real-world trading strategies can be much more complex and require thorough backtesting and risk management.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf

yf.pdr_override()

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'

# Collect data on this ticker
df = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickerSymbol, start="2020-01-01", end="2021-12-31")

# Calculate the short-term simple moving average
short_sma = df.Close.rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the long-term simple moving average
long_sma = df.Close.rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create a column in the dataframe to hold the trading signals
df['signal'] = 0.0

# Generate trading signals based on the crossover of the short and long SMAs
df['signal'][short_sma > long_sma] = 1.0
df['signal'][short_sma < long_sma] = -1.0

# Create a column in the dataframe to hold the trading orders
df['order'] = df['signal'].diff()

print(df)

# The 'order' column tells us when to place a trade. A value of 1 means buy and a value of -1 means sell.
```

This code first downloads historical price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) using the Yahoo Finance API. It then calculates the short-term (20-day) and long-term (100-day) simple moving averages of the closing prices. A trading signal is generated whenever the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average (a buy signal) or below the long-term moving average (a sell signal). The trading orders are then derived from these trading signals.
