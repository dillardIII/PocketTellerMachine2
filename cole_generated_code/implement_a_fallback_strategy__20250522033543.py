Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy for when no backtest results are found. In this example, the fallback strategy is to simply print a message and return an empty dictionary.

```python
def get_backtest_results(strategy):
    # Assume that `run_backtest` is a function that runs a backtest for a given strategy
    # and returns a dictionary with the results.
    results = run_backtest(strategy)

    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Falling back to default strategy.")
        # Here you can implement your fallback strategy. For simplicity, we'll just return an empty dictionary.
        return {}

    return results

def run_backtest(strategy):
    # This is a placeholder for the actual backtest running code.
    # It should return a dictionary with the results.
    # For now, it just returns an empty dictionary to simulate a scenario where no backtest results are found.
    return {}
```

You can replace the `run_backtest` function with your actual backtest running code. Also, you can replace the fallback strategy (currently just returning an empty dictionary) with whatever you want to do when no backtest results are found.
