Sure, here is a simple Python code that uses a basic trading strategy called Moving Average Crossover. This strategy is used to identify potential buy and sell signals. It involves two moving averages: a fast moving average (short term) and a slow moving average (long term). A buy signal is generated when the fast moving average crosses above the slow moving average, and a sell signal is generated when the fast moving average crosses below the slow moving average.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and may not always lead to wins. It's always recommended to use more complex strategies and consider various factors for real trading.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pandas_datareader import data as web

def calculate_moving_average(data, window):
    return data['Close'].rolling(window=window).mean()

def implement_strategy(data, short_window, long_window):
    data['Short_MA'] = calculate_moving_average(data, short_window)
    data['Long_MA'] = calculate_moving_average(data, long_window)
    
    data['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(data['Short_MA'] > data['Long_MA'], 1, 0)
    data['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(data['Short_MA'] < data['Long_MA'], -1, 0)
    
    return data

def plot_signals(data):
    plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
    plt.title('Buy and Sell signals')
    plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price', color='blue', alpha=0.35)
    plt.plot(data['Short_MA'], label='Short Moving Average', color='red', alpha=0.35)
    plt.plot(data['Long_MA'], label='Long Moving Average', color='green', alpha=0.35)
    plt.scatter(data.index, data['Buy_Signal'], color='green', marker='^', alpha=1)
    plt.scatter(data.index, data['Sell_Signal'], color='red', marker='v', alpha=1)
    plt.xlabel('Date')
    plt.ylabel('Close Price')
    plt.legend(loc='upper left')
    plt.show()

# Fetch data
ticker = 'AAPL'
df = web.DataReader(ticker, data_source='yahoo', start='01-01-2020', end='12-31-2020')

# Implement strategy
df = implement_strategy(df, short_window=20, long_window=50)

# Plot signals
plot_signals(df)
```

This code fetches the historical data for a particular stock (in this case, Apple Inc.), calculates the moving averages, generates buy and sell signals, and plots the signals on a graph. The green markers on the graph indicate buy signals and the red markers indicate sell signals.
