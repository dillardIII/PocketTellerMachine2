In order to conduct market research to identify potential trading opportunities, we can use Python libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation, `yfinance` to download the stock price data, and `matplotlib` for data visualization.

Here is a simple Python code to download the historical data of a specific stock and visualize its closing price:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the ticker symbol
tickerSymbol = 'AAPL'  # Apple Inc.

# Get data on this ticker
tickerData = yf.Ticker(tickerSymbol)

# Get the historical prices for this ticker
tickerDf = tickerData.history(period='1d', start='2010-1-1', end='2020-12-31')

# See your data
print(tickerDf)

# Plot the closing prices
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(tickerDf['Close'])
plt.title('Historical Closing Price of ' + tickerSymbol)
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Closing Price')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This code will download the historical data of Apple Inc. from 2010 to 2020 and plot the closing prices. You can replace `'AAPL'` with the ticker symbol of the company you are interested in.

Please note that identifying potential trading opportunities requires more complex analysis, including but not limited to trend analysis, moving average analysis, and other technical indicators. This code is just a starting point for market research.
