Sure, I can help you write a simple Python code that simulates a trade. However, please note that this is a very simplified version and real trading involves more complex algorithms and risk management strategies.

Here's a simple Python code that uses a hypothetical trading API:

```python
import random
import requests

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, base_url):
        self.base_url = base_url

    def get_market_conditions(self):
        # This is a mock function. In real world, you would use an API to get real market data.
        return random.choice(['Bullish', 'Bearish', 'Neutral'])

    def initiate_trade(self, trade_type, amount):
        # This is a mock function. In real world, you would use an API to initiate a trade.
        response = requests.post(f"{self.base_url}/trade", data={'type': trade_type, 'amount': amount})
        return response.status_code == 200

    def gauge_market(self):
        market_condition = self.get_market_conditions()
        if market_condition == 'Bullish':
            # If market is Bullish, we buy
            self.initiate_trade('buy', 100)
        elif market_condition == 'Bearish':
            # If market is Bearish, we sell
            self.initiate_trade('sell', 100)
        else:
            # If market is Neutral, we do nothing
            pass

ptm = PTM('http://example.com')
ptm.gauge_market()
```

This code creates a `PTM` class that has methods to get market conditions and initiate a trade. The `gauge_market` method decides whether to buy or sell based on the market conditions. In this code, we are assuming a hypothetical trading API at `http://example.com`. In real world, you would use the actual API provided by your trading platform.
