To analyze market trends and identify potential profitable trades, we would need historical market data. This data could be obtained from various sources like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, etc. Here is a simple Python code using pandas, yfinance, and sklearn libraries to analyze market trends:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 

# Download historical data as dataframe
data = yf.download('AAPL','2020-01-01','2022-12-31')

# Calculate the High Low Percentage (HLP)
data['HLP'] = (data['High'] - data['Low']) / data['Close'] * 100.0

# Calculate the Percentage Change
data['PCT_change'] = (data['Close'] - data['Open']) / data['Open'] * 100.0

# Define explanatory variables
exog = data[['HLP', 'PCT_change', 'Volume']]

# Define dependent variable
endog = data['Close']

# Split the data into training set and testing set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(exog, endog, test_size=0.2)

# Create a Linear Regression object
clf = LinearRegression()

# Train the model using the training sets
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the closing prices using our model for the test set
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

# Print the predictions
print(predictions)
```

This is a simple linear regression model that uses High Low Percentage (HLP), Percentage Change, and Volume as explanatory variables to predict the closing price. Please note that this is a very basic model and might not give accurate predictions. For more accurate predictions, more complex models like ARIMA, LSTM, etc. could be used. Also, more features could be used like opening price, closing price of previous day, etc. 

Also, please note that trading based on this model might not be profitable as it does not take into account many factors like news, market sentiment, etc. It is recommended to use this model along with other strategies and expert advice.
