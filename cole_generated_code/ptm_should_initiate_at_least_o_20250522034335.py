To initiate a trade, we can use a Python library called `yfinance` which allows us to interact with the Yahoo Finance API. Here's a simple example of how you might use it to initiate a trade. 

Please note that this is a simulated trade. In reality, you would need to use a broker's API (like Interactive Brokers, Alpaca, etc.) to actually execute trades.

```python
import yfinance as yf

# Define the stock to trade
stock = 'AAPL'

# Download stock data
data = yf.download(stock, start='2020-01-01', end='2020-12-31')

# Define a simple trading strategy: buy if the close price is higher than the open price
data['Buy_Signal'] = data['Close'] > data['Open']

# Simulate buying 1 share whenever the buy signal is True
data['Shares'] = data['Buy_Signal'].cumsum()

# Calculate the total value of the shares owned over time
data['Portfolio_Value'] = data['Shares'] * data['Close']

# Print the final portfolio value
print(f'Final portfolio value: {data["Portfolio_Value"].iloc[-1]}')
```

This script downloads historical data for Apple's stock, then simulates a simple trading strategy where you buy one share of the stock whenever the closing price is higher than the opening price. It then calculates the total value of the shares owned over time, and prints the final portfolio value.

Remember, this is a very simple and naive trading strategy. In reality, you would need to consider many more factors, such as transaction costs, risk management, diversification, etc.
