To analyze market trends and patterns, we can use Python's libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computations, matplotlib for visualization, and sklearn for machine learning. However, this is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of both programming and financial markets. Here is a basic example of how you might start to approach this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the data
# Replace 'file.csv' with your actual file path
df = pd.read_csv('file.csv')

# Assume 'Close' is the target column we want to predict
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df.Date,format='%Y-%m-%d')
df.index = df['Date']

# Plotting the target variable
plt.figure(figsize=(16,8))
plt.plot(df['Close'], label='Close Price history')

# Creating a new dataframe with only 'Close' column
data = df.sort_index(ascending=True, axis=0)
new_data = pd.DataFrame(index=range(0,len(df)),columns=['Date', 'Close'])

for i in range(0,len(data)):
     new_data['Date'][i] = data['Date'][i]
     new_data['Close'][i] = data['Close'][i]

# Splitting into train and validation
train = new_data[:987]
valid = new_data[987:]

x_train = train.drop('Close', axis=1)
y_train = train['Close']
x_valid = valid.drop('Close', axis=1)
y_valid = valid['Close']

# Implement linear regression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(x_train,y_train)

# Make predictions and find the rmse
preds = model.predict(x_valid)
rms=np.sqrt(np.mean(np.power((np.array(y_valid)-np.array(preds)),2)))
print('\n RMSE value on validation set:', rms)
```

This is a very basic model using linear regression to predict the closing price of a stock. It's important to note that stock price prediction is extremely difficult and this simple model is unlikely to be very accurate. More advanced techniques would involve using time series analysis, machine learning models, or even deep learning.

Please replace 'file.csv' with your actual file and 'Close' with the column you want to predict. Also, this code assumes that your data is daily. If it's not, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.
