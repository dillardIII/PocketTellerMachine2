Creating a Python script to analyze market trends and patterns to identify potential trading opportunities is a complex task. It requires knowledge of financial markets, trading strategies, and machine learning techniques. Here is a simple example of how you might start building such a system using Python and pandas library.

This script will analyze the historical price data of a stock, calculate its moving averages, and identify potential buy and sell signals based on crossover strategy.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as web
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Fetch historical data
stock = 'AAPL'
df = web.DataReader(stock, data_source='yahoo', start='01-01-2020', end='12-31-2020')

# Calculate moving averages
short_MA = df.Close.rolling(window=20).mean()
long_MA = df.Close.rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create signals
signals = [1 if short_MA[i] > long_MA[i] else 0 for i in range(len(short_MA))]

# Identify potential buy/sell opportunities
buy_signals = [df.index[i] for i in range(1, len(signals)) if signals[i] - signals[i-1] == 1]
sell_signals = [df.index[i] for i in range(1, len(signals)) if signals[i] - signals[i-1] == -1]

# Plot data
plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
plt.plot(df.index, df['Close'], label=stock, color = 'blue')
plt.plot(short_MA.index, short_MA, label='20 days MA', color = 'red')
plt.plot(long_MA.index, long_MA, label='100 days MA', color = 'green')
plt.scatter(buy_signals, [df['Close'][i] for i in buy_signals], color='green', marker='^', alpha=1)
plt.scatter(sell_signals, [df['Close'][i] for i in sell_signals], color='red', marker='v', alpha=1)
plt.title('Stock Price with Buy/Sell Signals')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

This script uses a simple moving average crossover strategy to generate buy and sell signals. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it generates a buy signal. Conversely, when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, it generates a sell signal.

Please note that this is a very basic example and real-world trading systems are much more complex and take many more factors into account when generating trading signals.
