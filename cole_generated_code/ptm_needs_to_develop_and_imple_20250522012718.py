Sure, here is a simple example of a Python code for a trading strategy. This strategy is based on moving averages, a common indicator used in trading strategies. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    return data.rolling(window=window).mean()

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    return data.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

def trading_strategy(data):
    # Calculate the short term exponential moving average
    ShortEMA = calculate_ema(data['Close'], 12)
    # Calculate the long term exponential moving average
    LongEMA = calculate_ema(data['Close'], 26)
    
    # Create signals
    data['Buy_Signal'] = (ShortEMA > LongEMA)
    data['Sell_Signal'] = (ShortEMA < LongEMA)
    
    return data

def main():
    # Download historical data as dataframe
    data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')
    
    # Implement the trading strategy
    data = trading_strategy(data)
    
    # Print data
    print(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and does not take into account many factors that could impact the performance of this strategy in live trading. It is always recommended to thoroughly backtest any trading strategy before live trading. Also, this script requires the `pandas`, `yfinance` libraries. 

This strategy uses the concept of short term and long term exponential moving averages. When the short term average is above the long term average, it indicates a potential buy signal. Conversely, when the short term average is below the long term average, it indicates a potential sell signal. 

This is a simple example and real-world trading strategies can be much more complex, taking into account various other factors and using more sophisticated algorithms.
