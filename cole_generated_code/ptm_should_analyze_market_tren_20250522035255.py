In order to analyze market trends and adjust the trading approach accordingly, we would need historical market data. We can use libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical calculations, matplotlib for plotting data, and sklearn for machine learning. However, creating a full-fledged trading bot is a complex task and requires deep understanding of both programming and financial markets. 

Here is a simple example of how you might start to analyze market trends using Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assume we have a CSV file with historical market data
# Columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
data = pd.read_csv('market_data.csv')

# Convert Date column to datetime
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])

# Set Date as the index of the dataframe
data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Calculate the moving average
data['Moving_Avg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Calculate the standard deviation
data['Std_Dev'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).std()

# Plot the closing price and moving average
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(data['Close'], label='Close Price')
plt.plot(data['Moving_Avg'], label='Moving Average')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.show()

# Create a Linear Regression model to predict future prices
lr_model = LinearRegression()
lr_model.fit(np.array(data.index).reshape(-1, 1), data['Close'])

# Predict the closing price for the next day
next_day = data.index[-1] + pd.DateOffset(days=1)
predicted_price = lr_model.predict(np.array(pd.to_datetime(next_day)).reshape(-1, 1))

print(f'Predicted closing price for {next_day.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")} is {predicted_price[0]}')
```

This is a very basic example and doesn't take into account many factors that could influence the market trends. For a real trading bot, you would need to consider many more factors, use more sophisticated models, and also implement risk management strategies.
