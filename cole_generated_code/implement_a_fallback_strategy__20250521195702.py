Sure, here is a simple Python code that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found. The fallback strategy could be anything based on your business requirements. In this example, I am just printing a message and returning an empty dictionary.

```python
# Function to get backtest results
def get_backtest_results():
    # This is a placeholder for the actual code to get backtest results.
    # The actual code could be anything like reading from a database, calling an API, etc.
    return {}

# Function to implement fallback strategy
def fallback_strategy():
    print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
    return {}

# Main function to get backtest results and implement fallback strategy if no results are found
def main():
    backtest_results = get_backtest_results()
    if not backtest_results:
        backtest_results = fallback_strategy()
    return backtest_results

# Call the main function
main()
```

In this code, the `get_backtest_results` function is a placeholder for the actual code to get backtest results. The `fallback_strategy` function is where you would implement your fallback strategy. The `main` function is where the backtest results are obtained and the fallback strategy is implemented if no results are found.
