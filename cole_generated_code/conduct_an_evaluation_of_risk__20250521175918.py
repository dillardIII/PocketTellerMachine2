In order to evaluate the risk management strategies for trading, we might need several functions and data such as the historical data, volatility, Value at Risk (VaR), etc. Following is the basic example of Python code to calculate some risk indicators.

Please replace `df` with your actual dataset:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import norm

# Assuming df is the DataFrame containing historical data
# Replace df with your actual dataset

# Function to calculate daily returns
def calculate_daily_returns(df):
    return df.pct_change()

# Function to calculate volatility
def calculate_volatility(df):
    return np.std(df)

# Function to calculate Value at Risk (VaR)
def calculate_VaR(df, confidence_level = 0.05):
    return np.percentile(df, 100 * (1-confidence_level))

# Function to calculate Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
def calculate_CVaR(df, confidence_level = 0.05):
    var = calculate_VaR(df, confidence_level)
    return df[df < var].mean()

# Calculating risk indicators
daily_returns = calculate_daily_returns(df)
volatility = calculate_volatility(daily_returns)
VaR = calculate_VaR(daily_returns)
CVaR = calculate_CVaR(daily_returns)

print("Volatility: ", volatility)
print("Value at Risk at 95% confidence level: ", VaR)
print("Conditional Value at Risk at 95% confidence level: ", CVaR)
```

This script simply provides some basic risk management indicators. A comprehensive risk management strategy for trading involves many more components such as diversification, stop-loss orders, position sizing, etc. Please use this script as a starting point and modify it according to your requirements.

Also, note that the effectiveness of these strategies largely depends upon the specific trading scenario, the accuracy of your data and many other factors. This script does not guarantee profit or complete avoidance of loss in trading.
