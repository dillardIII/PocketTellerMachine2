Sure, here is a simple Python code snippet that implements a fallback strategy when no backtest results are found.

```python
def backtest_strategy(strategy):
    try:
        # try to backtest the strategy
        results = strategy.backtest()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Backtest failed: {e}")
        results = None

    # if no results found, implement fallback strategy
    if not results:
        print("No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.")
        fallback_strategy = FallbackStrategy()
        results = fallback_strategy.backtest()

    return results
```

In this code, we first try to backtest the given strategy. If an exception is raised or if no results are returned, we implement a fallback strategy. The `FallbackStrategy` is assumed to be another strategy that we have defined elsewhere in our code. 

Please note that you need to replace `strategy.backtest()` and `FallbackStrategy().backtest()` with the actual methods you are using to backtest your strategies. The above code is a simple example and may need to be adjusted based on your actual trading system.
