Sure, here's a simple example of a Python code for a trading strategy. This code uses a basic moving average crossover strategy to diversify its portfolio. It buys when the short-term average crosses above the long-term average and sells when the short-term average crosses below the long-term average.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and may not be suitable for actual trading. Real-world trading strategies are often much more complex and take into account many other factors.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as pdr
import yfinance as yf
yf.pdr_override()

# Define the instruments to download. We would like to see Apple, Microsoft and the S&P500 index.
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', '^GSPC']

# We would like all available data from 01/01/2000 until 12/31/2016.
start_date = '2000-01-01'
end_date = '2016-12-31'

# User pandas_reader.data.DataReader to load the desired data. As simple as that.
panel_data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(tickers, start_date, end_date)

# Getting just the adjusted closing prices. This will return a Pandas DataFrame
# The index in this DataFrame is the major index of the panel_data.
close = panel_data['Adj Close']

# Calculate the short and long window simple moving averages
short_window = 40
long_window = 100

signals = pd.DataFrame(index=close.index)
signals['signal'] = 0.0

# Create short simple moving average over the short window
signals['short_mavg'] = close['AAPL'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

# Create long simple moving average over the long window
signals['long_mavg'] = close['AAPL'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1, center=False).mean()

# Create signals
signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] 
                                            > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)   

# Generate trading orders
signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

# Print `signals`
print(signals)
```

This script will print a DataFrame that shows whether we should be long or short on a particular day. This is determined by whether the short-term moving average is above or below the long-term moving average.
