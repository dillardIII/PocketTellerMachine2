Sure, I can provide you with a simple Python code example of a basic trading strategy. However, please note that this is a very simplified example and real-world trading strategies are much more complex and involve various factors such as risk management, market analysis, and more.

Let's implement a simple moving average crossover strategy. This strategy is based on the idea that if the short-term moving average crosses the long-term moving average, it may be a signal of future price trends.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas_datareader import data as web

def calculate_sma(data, window):
    sma = data.rolling(window=window).mean()
    return sma

def calculate_ema(data, window):
    ema = data.ewm(span=window).mean()
    return ema

def implement_strategy(data):
    # Calculate SMA and EMA
    sma = calculate_sma(data['Close'], 50)
    ema = calculate_ema(data['Close'], 200)

    # Create a column 'Signal' such that if 50-day SMA is greater
    # than 200-day EMA then set Signal as 1 else 0
    data['Signal'] = 0.0  
    data['Signal'] = np.where(sma > ema, 1.0, 0.0)

    # Create a column 'Position' which is a day-to-day difference of the 'Signal' column
    data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

def fetch_data(symbol):
    df = web.DataReader(symbol, 'yahoo')
    return df

def main():
    data = fetch_data('AAPL')
    implement_strategy(data)
    print(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script fetches the historical price data of a stock (in this case, Apple Inc.), calculates the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), and generates trading signals based on the crossover of these two averages.

Please note that this is a very basic strategy and should not be used for real trading without proper backtesting and risk management. Also, this script uses Yahoo Finance for fetching the price data, so make sure to handle the data responsibly and respect Yahoo's terms of service.
