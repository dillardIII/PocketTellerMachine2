Sure, I can provide a simple example of how you might initiate trades using a Python library called `yfinance` to fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance. However, please note that this is a simplified example and actual trading involves a lot more considerations and complexities.

```python
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []

    def initiate_trade(self, ticker, trade_type, quantity):
        stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)
        price = stock.history().tail(1)['Close'].iloc[0]
        trade = {
            'ticker': ticker,
            'trade_type': trade_type,
            'quantity': quantity,
            'price': price,
            'date': datetime.now()
        }
        self.trades.append(trade)
        print(f"Trade initiated: {trade}")

    def get_trades(self):
        return self.trades

# Initialize PTM
ptm = PTM()

# Initiate trades
ptm.initiate_trade("AAPL", "buy", 10)
ptm.initiate_trade("MSFT", "sell", 5)
ptm.initiate_trade("GOOGL", "buy", 7)

# Get trades
trades = ptm.get_trades()
for trade in trades:
    print(trade)
```

In this example, `PTM` is a simple trading bot that can initiate trades and store them in a list. The `initiate_trade` method takes a ticker symbol, a trade type (buy or sell), and a quantity, and then fetches the current price of the stock using `yfinance`. It then creates a trade dictionary with this information and the current date and time, and adds it to the list of trades.

Please note that this code does not actually execute any trades, it just simulates the process for the purpose of generating data. In a real-world scenario, you would need to integrate with a trading platform's API to execute trades.
