As an AI, I am unable to directly analyze the market conditions or competitors' strategies due to lack of real-time data. However, I'm able to provide you with a general Python script that shows how to fetch stock market data and perform simple analysis. You could use libraries such as `yfinance`, `pandas`, and `numpy` for the same.
 
This example specifically fetches data for Microsoft (MSFT), but you can replace "MSFT" with the ticker of any other company you wish to analyze:

```Python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Fetch data for Microsoft
msft = yf.Ticker("MSFT")

# Get historical market data
hist = msft.history(period="5d")

# Analyze stock data
print("Recent Closing Prices: ", hist['Close'])
print("Mean Closing Price: ", np.mean(hist['Close']))
print("Price Volatility: ", np.std(hist['Close']))

# Plot Close prices
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(hist['Close'])
plt.title('Microsoft (MSFT) Closing Prices')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Closing Price')
plt.show()
```

Please note: 
- This script only fetches a stock's latest closing prices, calculates the mean closing price, and calculates its standard deviation (considered as a basic measure of price volatility). You might want to use more sophisticated financial models to perform a deeper analysis.
- In order to analyze competitors' strategies, you will need access to specific private data or insight that might violate confidentiality and privacy norms, which isn't feasible or ethical.
- Generally, a Python script alone couldn't analyze market conditions or competitors' strategies. You typically need domain knowledge in financial markets, combined with Natural Language Processing (NLP) for processing news and public reports, Machine Learning algorithms for predictions and, most importantly, access to real-time, accurate data.
