Unfortunately, we cannot use actual live trading due to legal and ethical considerations. However, I can present a basic model of trading using a Python code. Instead of real trading, let's simulate it by using pandas dataframe to show how it can be achieved. Suppose we have a list of stocks with their prices and we can trade them according to their prices. You can use any online trading API like Alpaca, ETrade, Interactive Brokers for real trading.

Here's an example python code on how Cole's PTM can diversify the portfolio:

```python
import pandas as pd
import random

class Trade:
  def __init__(self):
    self.portfolio = {}
    print("PTM Initialized")

  def buy_stock(self, stock_name, num_shares):
    if stock_name in self.portfolio:
      self.portfolio[stock_name] += num_shares
    else:
      self.portfolio[stock_name] = num_shares
    print(f"Bought {num_shares} of {stock_name} stock.")

  def sell_stock(self, stock_name, num_shares):
    if stock_name in self.portfolio and self.portfolio[stock_name] >= num_shares:
      self.portfolio[stock_name] -= num_shares
      print(f"Sold {num_shares} of {stock_name} stock.")

  def view_portfolio(self):
    s = sum(self.portfolio.values())
    for stock, share in self.portfolio.items():
      print(f"{stock}: {share}, contribution: {100*share/s}%")
    print(f"Total Shares: {s}")

# instantiate PTM Trade class
trading_ptm = Trade()

# list of stock names
stocks = ['stock1', 'stock2', 'stock3', 'stock4', 'stock5']

# simulate buying stocks
for i in range(5):
  trading_ptm.buy_stock(random.choice(stocks), random.randint(1,100))

# view portfolio
trading_ptm.view_portfolio()
```

The above code is a simple demonstration of how a trading algorithm operates. For real application, you would need to fetch real data using trading API's. Additionally, you may want to use a complex decision-making process to decide when to buy or sell a stock, rather than random decision as demonstrated in the code above. You can set criteria based on price, volume and other financial indicators.

The diversification is achieved here by buying different stocks selected randomly, but in a real application, you may select these based on covariances or other criteria to achieve a well-diversified portfolio.
