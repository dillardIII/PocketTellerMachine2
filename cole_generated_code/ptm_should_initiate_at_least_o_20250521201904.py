Here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade. Please note that this is a very basic example and real trading involves more complex strategies and risk management.

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance

    def initiate_trade(self, trade_amount):
        # Simulate a win or loss with equal probability
        win = random.choice([True, False])

        if win:
            print("Trade won!")
            self.balance += trade_amount
        else:
            print("Trade lost!")
            self.balance -= trade_amount

        print(f"Current balance: {self.balance}")

# Initialize trading with a balance of 1000
ptm = Trade(1000)

# PTM initiates a trade of 100
ptm.initiate_trade(100)
```

In this code, we create a `Trade` class which has a `balance` and a method `initiate_trade` to simulate a trade. The trade can either be a win or a loss, which is determined randomly. If the trade is a win, the trade amount is added to the balance. If the trade is a loss, the trade amount is subtracted from the balance. The current balance is then printed. 

We create an instance of the `Trade` class with an initial balance of 1000 and then initiate a trade of 100. The result of the trade and the new balance is printed.
