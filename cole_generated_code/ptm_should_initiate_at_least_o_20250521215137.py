Sure, here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. This code uses a hypothetical trading API to place a trade. Please note that this is a simplified version and real-world trading involves more complexities.

```python
import requests

class PTM:
    def __init__(self, api_url, api_key):
        self.api_url = api_url
        self.api_key = api_key

    def initiate_trade(self, symbol, quantity, action):
        # Define the endpoint URL
        endpoint = f"{self.api_url}/trade"

        # Define the headers for the API request
        headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_key}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }

        # Define the data for the trade
        data = {
            "symbol": symbol,
            "quantity": quantity,
            "action": action
        }

        # Send the API request
        response = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json=data)

        # Check if the request was successful
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print(f"Trade initiated successfully: {response.json()}")
        else:
            print(f"Failed to initiate trade: {response.json()}")

# Initialize PTM
ptm = PTM(api_url="https://api.trading.com", api_key="your_api_key")

# Initiate a trade
ptm.initiate_trade(symbol="AAPL", quantity=10, action="buy")
```

In this code, we create a class `PTM` that represents our trading model. It has a method `initiate_trade` that sends a POST request to the trading API to place a trade. The `symbol`, `quantity`, and `action` parameters of this method represent the stock symbol, the number of shares, and the action (buy/sell), respectively.

Please replace `"https://api.trading.com"` and `"your_api_key"` with your actual trading API URL and API key. Also, this is a hypothetical example, you need to replace the API endpoint, headers, and data according to your actual trading API documentation.
