Sure, here's a basic example of how you might set up a trade in Python. This example uses the `yfinance` library to get stock price data and the `pandas` library to analyze it. 

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

def initiate_trade(stock_symbol):
    # Download historical data as dataframe
    data = yf.download(stock_symbol, start="2020-01-01", end="2021-12-31")

    # Calculate the short/simple moving average over the short window
    short_rolling = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

    # Calculate the long/simple moving average over the long window
    long_rolling = data['Close'].rolling(window=100).mean()

    # Initiating a trade when short rolling > long rolling (buy signal)
    data['Buy_Signal'] = short_rolling > long_rolling

    # Initiating a trade when short rolling < long rolling (sell signal)
    data['Sell_Signal'] = short_rolling < long_rolling

    # Create a column 'Buy' where if 'Buy_Signal' is True then 'Buy' is 1 else 0
    data['Buy'] = [1 if x == True else 0 for x in data['Buy_Signal']]

    # Create a column 'Sell' where if 'Sell_Signal' is True then 'Sell' is 1 else 0
    data['Sell'] = [1 if x == True else 0 for x in data['Sell_Signal']]

    # Calculate wins and losses
    data['Wins'] = data['Buy'].diff().apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 1 else 0).sum()
    data['Losses'] = data['Sell'].diff().apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 1 else 0).sum()

    return data

stock_symbol = 'AAPL'
trade_data = initiate_trade(stock_symbol)
print(trade_data)
```

This code initiates a trade based on a simple moving average crossover strategy. When the short moving average crosses above the long moving average, it's a buy signal, and when it crosses below, it's a sell signal. The code then calculates the number of wins and losses based on these signals. 

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and is unlikely to be profitable without further refinement. It's also important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.
