In order to initiate a trade, we need to interact with a trading platform. Here is a simple example of how to use the Alpaca API to initiate a trade. Alpaca provides commission-free stock trading API.

Firstly, you need to install the Alpaca API by using pip:

```python
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

Then, you can use the following code to initiate a trade:

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Replace these with your API connection info from the dashboard
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

This code will initiate a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock. Please replace `<APCA-API-KEY-ID>` and `<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>` with your own API key and secret key.

Please note that this is a paper trading API, which means it's for testing and doesn't use real money. When you feel comfortable with your strategy, you can switch to the live trading API. Also, please be aware that trading involves risk, and this is not investment advice.
