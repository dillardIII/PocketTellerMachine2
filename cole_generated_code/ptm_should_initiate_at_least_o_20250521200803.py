To initiate a trade, we need to interact with a trading platform. There are several trading platforms available, each with its own API, such as ETrade, Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, etc. Here is an example of how to initiate a trade using the Alpaca API:

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API connection
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

Please replace '<APCA-API-KEY-ID>' and '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>' with your actual Alpaca API key ID and secret key.

This code will initiate a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock. The order type is 'market', which means it will be executed at the best available price in the market. The 'time_in_force' parameter is set to 'gtc' (good till cancelled), which means the order will remain active until it is filled or cancelled.

Please note that this is a very basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to implement more sophisticated trading strategies, taking into account factors such as market trends, risk management, etc. Also, you would need to handle potential errors, such as insufficient funds, API connection issues, etc.
