To analyze market trends and opportunities, we need to use some sort of data analysis. In this case, we will use Python with pandas and yfinance libraries. Pandas is a library used for data manipulation and analysis. It is used to extract data and store it in the desired format. yfinance is a popular open source library to access the financial data available on Yahoo Finance.

Here is a simple Python script that fetches the historical data of a specific stock symbol, calculates its moving average and suggests to buy if the latest closing price is higher than the moving average.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

def analyze_stock(symbol):
    # Fetch historical market data
    data = yf.download(symbol, start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31')

    # Calculate 50 days Moving Average
    data['MA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

    # Check if the latest closing price is higher than the MA
    if data['Close'][-1] > data['MA50'][-1]:
        return f"Suggest to buy {symbol}"
    else:
        return f"No suggestion for {symbol}"

# Test the function
print(analyze_stock('AAPL'))
```

Please note that this is a very basic form of analysis and does not take into account many factors that could influence a stock's price. It is always recommended to do a thorough analysis and/or consult with a financial advisor before making trading decisions.

Also, you need to install yfinance and pandas libraries if they are not installed yet. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas
```
