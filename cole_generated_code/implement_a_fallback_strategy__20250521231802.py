Sure, here's a simple example of how you might implement a fallback strategy in Python. In this case, if no backtest results are found, the program will print a message and then execute some fallback code.

```python
def backtest_strategy():
    # This is just a placeholder for your backtest strategy
    # Replace this with your actual backtest code
    pass

def fallback_strategy():
    # This is your fallback strategy
    # Replace this with your actual fallback code
    print("Executing fallback strategy...")

def execute_strategy():
    backtest_results = backtest_strategy()

    if backtest_results is None:
        print("No backtest results found.")
        fallback_strategy()
    else:
        # If backtest results are found, do something with them
        print("Backtest results found.")
        print(backtest_results)

# Call the function to execute the strategy
execute_strategy()
```

In this code, `backtest_strategy()` is a placeholder for your actual backtest strategy, and `fallback_strategy()` is a placeholder for your fallback strategy. If `backtest_strategy()` returns `None` (indicating that no backtest results were found), then `fallback_strategy()` is called. If `backtest_strategy()` returns something other than `None`, then the program assumes that backtest results were found and does something with them.
