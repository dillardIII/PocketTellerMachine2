Your request seems to be a bit vague. However, I can provide you with a simple Python code that simulates a basic trading strategy. For more complex strategies, we would need more specific details.

Here is a simple Python code for a moving average crossover strategy. This strategy buys a stock when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, and sells the stock when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical data for desired ticker symbol
ticker = "AAPL"
ticker_data = yf.download(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2021-12-31")

# Calculate short-term and long-term moving averages
short_term_MA = ticker_data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
long_term_MA = ticker_data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Create signals based on crossover
ticker_data['Buy_Signal'] = (short_term_MA > long_term_MA) * 1.0
ticker_data['Sell_Signal'] = (short_term_MA < long_term_MA) * 1.0

# Print data
print(ticker_data)
```

This code uses the `yfinance` library to download historical data for a specific ticker symbol. It then calculates the short-term and long-term moving averages of the closing prices. When the short-term moving average is greater than the long-term moving average, it generates a buy signal, and when the short-term moving average is less than the long-term moving average, it generates a sell signal.

Please note that this is a very basic trading strategy and may not be profitable in real-world trading. It's always recommended to backtest any strategy before live trading. Also, this code doesn't include any trading fees or slippage.
