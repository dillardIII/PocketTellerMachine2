Sure, I can provide a simple example of a Python code that uses the Alpaca API to initiate a trade. Alpaca is a platform that allows users to build and trade with real-time market data for free. 

Please note that you need to install the Alpaca API first by using pip install alpaca-trade-api in your terminal or command prompt.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Set up the API
api = tradeapi.REST('<APCA-API-KEY-ID>', '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets') 

# Submit a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock (symbol: AAPL)
api.submit_order(
    symbol='AAPL',
    qty=1,
    side='buy',
    type='market',
    time_in_force='gtc'
)
```

Please replace '<APCA-API-KEY-ID>' and '<APCA-API-SECRET-KEY>' with your actual Alpaca API key ID and secret key. If you don't have an Alpaca account, you need to create one and generate these keys.

This script will initiate a market order to buy 1 share of Apple stock. 'gtc' stands for "Good Till Cancelled", which means the order will stay open until it is filled or cancelled.

Please note that this is a very basic example. In a real trading scenario, you would need to implement more complex strategies, error handling, and possibly use other types of orders (limit, stop, etc.).
