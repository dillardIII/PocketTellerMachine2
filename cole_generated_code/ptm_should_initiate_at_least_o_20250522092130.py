Here is a simple Python code that simulates a trade initiation. This code doesn't connect to any real trading platform, it's just a simulation. 

```python
import random

class Trade:
    def __init__(self, trade_id, asset, volume, price):
        self.trade_id = trade_id
        self.asset = asset
        self.volume = volume
        self.price = price

class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []
        self.assets = ['AAPL', 'GOOG', 'TSLA', 'AMZN', 'MSFT']
        self.trade_id = 0

    def initiate_trade(self):
        asset = random.choice(self.assets)
        volume = random.randint(1, 100)
        price = random.uniform(100.0, 1500.0)
        trade = Trade(self.trade_id, asset, volume, price)
        self.trades.append(trade)
        self.trade_id += 1
        print(f'Trade initiated: {trade.trade_id}, Asset: {trade.asset}, Volume: {trade.volume}, Price: {trade.price}')

ptm = PTM()
ptm.initiate_trade()
```

This code defines a `Trade` class with attributes for trade id, asset, volume, and price. The `PTM` class has methods to initiate a trade with random asset, volume, and price. The `initiate_trade` method creates a new trade and adds it to the list of trades. 

Please note that in a real-world scenario, you would need to connect to a trading platform's API to initiate a trade, and the code would be much more complex, involving error handling, authentication, and more.
