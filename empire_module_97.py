Creating an advanced Python module with intelligent recursion requires a clear understanding of what we mean by "intelligent recursion". Typically, recursion involves a function calling itself to solve a smaller instance of a problem, but "intelligent recursion" suggests enhancements that make the recursion process more efficient or adaptable.

For the purposes of this example, I'll create a module named `smart_recursion.py` that includes an enhanced recursive function. This function will leverage caching to optimize recursive calls and will demonstrate a practical application — computing Fibonacci numbers, a classic problem for recursion.

### Implementation

```python
# smart_recursion.py

from functools import lru_cache

class SmartRecursion:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memo = {}

    def fibonacci(self, n):
        """
        Intelligent recursive function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
        Uses caching to optimize repeated calculations.
        """
        if n <= 1:
            return n

        if n not in self.memo:
            print(f"Calculating Fibonacci number for: {n}")
            self.memo[n] = self.fibonacci(n - 1) + self.fibonacci(n - 2)
        else:
            print(f"Using cached value for: {n}")

        return self.memo[n]

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def cached_fibonacci(self, n):
        """
        LRU cached version of the Fibonacci calculation for demonstration.
        """
        if n <= 1:
            return n
        return self.cached_fibonacci(n - 1) + self.cached_fibonacci(n - 2)

    def factorial(self, n):
        """
        Simple recursive function to calculate factorial of n.
        Enhancements with checks for special cases and better recursion depth handling.
        """
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
        if n in (0, 1):
            return 1
        return n * self.factorial(n - 1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sr = SmartRecursion()
    n = 10
    
    print("Calculating Fibonacci with memoization:")
    for i in range(n + 1):
        print(f"Fibonacci({i}): {sr.fibonacci(i)}")

    print("\nCalculating Fibonacci with LRU cache:")
    for i in range(n + 1):
        print(f"Fibonacci({i}): {sr.cached_fibonacci(i)}")
    
    print("\nCalculating Factorial:")
    for i in range(n + 1):
        print(f"Factorial({i}): {sr.factorial(i)}")
```

### Key Features

1. **Memoization:** Using a dictionary to store already-computed Fibonacci numbers, reducing the number of recursive calls.

2. **LRU Cache:** Demonstrates `functools.lru_cache` to efficiently cache recursive function calls and avoid recomputation.

3. **Error Handling and Optimization:** Includes error checks for negative numbers in the factorial function and avoids unnecessary computations with base case checks.

4. **Demonstration:** The script prints progress to show when a value is calculated versus when it’s retrieved from the cache.

### Usage

To use this module, you can import the `SmartRecursion` class into your Python project and call its methods to solve recursive problems more efficiently. This approach forms a foundation for more complex recursive problem-solving scenarios while leveraging intelligent caching techniques.
