Sure, here's a creative Python utility designed for managing and simulating an empire's resource allocation and expansion strategy in a hypothetical game setting. This utility will allow an empire to allocate resources to various sectors (e.g., agriculture, military, research) and simulate the outcomes of these allocations over a series of turns to measure growth, military strength, and technological advancement.

```python
import random
from collections import defaultdict

class EmpireSimulation:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.resources = 1000  # Starting resources
        self.turn = 0
        self.sectors = {
            'agriculture': 0,
            'military': 0,
            'research': 0
        }
        self.history = []

    def allocate_resources(self, agriculture, military, research):
        total = agriculture + military + research
        if total > self.resources:
            raise ValueError("Cannot allocate more resources than available.")

        self.sectors['agriculture'] = agriculture
        self.sectors['military'] = military
        self.sectors['research'] = research
        self.resources -= total

    def simulate_turn(self):
        self.turn += 1
        growth_factor = self.sectors['agriculture'] / 100
        military_strength = self.sectors['military']**0.5
        tech_advancement = self.sectors['research'] / 50

        food_produced = 10 + random.uniform(0, growth_factor)
        military_power = 5 + random.uniform(0, military_strength)
        tech_points = 1 + random.uniform(0, tech_advancement)

        self.resources += food_produced + tech_points - (self.turn * 2)
        self.history.append({
            'turn': self.turn,
            'food_produced': food_produced,
            'military_power': military_power,
            'tech_points': tech_points,
            'remaining_resources': self.resources
        })

    def summarize(self):
        print(f"Empire: {self.name}")
        print(f"Total Turns: {self.turn}")
        print(f"Final Resources: {self.resources}")
        print("Turn History:")
        for entry in self.history:
            print(entry)

def main():
    empire = EmpireSimulation("Galactic Empire")

    try:
        for _ in range(10):  # Simulate 10 turns
            empire.allocate_resources(
                agriculture=random.randint(100, 200),
                military=random.randint(50, 150),
                research=random.randint(50, 150)
            )
            empire.simulate_turn()

        empire.summarize()

    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Failed to allocate resources: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Empire Initialization**: The simulation starts with a predefined amount of resources that can be allocated each turn.
   
2. **Resource Allocation**: The `allocate_resources` method lets the player allocate resources across three sectors: agriculture, military, and research. It ensures that the total allocation does not exceed the available resources.

3. **Simulation Turn**: The `simulate_turn` method calculates the outcomes based on allocated resources each turn: `food_produced`, `military_power`, and `tech_points`. Some resources are consumed by the passage of time, modeled as a reduction each turn.

4. **Randomness**: Randomness is incorporated to simulate variability in growth and outcomes, making each run slightly different.

5. **History and Summary**: Results of each turn are stored, and at the end, a summary provides insights into how well the empire fared across all turns.

This utility is a basic simulation, but it can be expanded with more complexity, like diplomatic actions, trade, events, or AI opponents for a richer game experience.
