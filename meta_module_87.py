Designing a Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably, an acronym for a theoretical empire or organization) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves several steps. Let's outline a high-level design for such a module. The design will focus on creating a robust, recursive system that can autonomously improve and evolve.

### Module Name
```
autonomy_expander
```

### Key Features
1. **Recursive Learning Algorithms**
   - Implement state-of-the-art recursive strategies, such as recursive neural networks or genetic programming, to facilitate continuous self-improvement.
  
2. **Self-Assessment and Feedback Loop**
   - Incorporate mechanisms for self-assessment, enabling the system to analyze its performance and adjust strategies dynamically.

3. **Adaptive Goal Setting**
   - Design adaptive goal-setting algorithms that redefine objectives based on environmental feedback and internal assessments.
  
4. **Resource Optimization**
   - Implement resource management functionalities to optimize computational and physical resources while evolving its capabilities.
  
5. **Safety and Compliance Checks**
   - Ensure that safety protocols and compliance checks are recursively evaluated and updated.

### Module Components

#### 1. Recursive Learning Engine
```python
class RecursiveLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self, model, data):
        self.model = model
        self.data = data
    
    def evolve_model(self):
        """
        Recursively refine the model using new data and feedback.
        """
        # Pseudocode
        new_model = self.model.train(self.data)
        self.model = self._recursive_update(new_model)
    
    def _recursive_update(self, model):
        # Pseudocode for recursive update logic
        print("Performing recursive update on the model")
        # Example: Apply genetic programming or similar technique
        return model
```

#### 2. Self-Assessment Module
```python
class SelfAssessment:
    def __init__(self, system_metrics):
        self.system_metrics = system_metrics

    def evaluate_performance(self):
        """
        Evaluate current performance and return feedback for improvement.
        """
        # Analyze metrics and provide recursive feedback
        feedback = self._generate_feedback(self.system_metrics)
        return feedback

    def _generate_feedback(self, metrics):
        # Pseudocode for feedback logic
        feedback = {metric: "improve" for metric in metrics if metrics[metric] < threshold}:
        return feedback
```

#### 3. Adaptive Goal Setting
```python
class AdaptiveGoalSetting:
    def __init__(self, initial_goals):
        self.goals = initial_goals

    def update_goals(self, feedback):
        """
        Update goals based on feedback from the self-assessment module.
        """
        for goal, status in feedback.items():
            if status == 'improve':
                self.goals[goal] *= 1.1  # Example strategy: Increase goal by 10%
        print(f"Adjusted Goals: {self.goals}")
```

#### 4. Resource Optimization Manager
```python
class ResourceManager:
    def __init__(self, resources):
        self.resources = resources
    
    def optimize_resources(self):
        """
        Optimize resource allocation recursively.
        """
        for resource in self.resources:
            if self._resource_underutilized(resource):
                self._reallocate(resource)
    
    def _resource_underutilized(self, resource):
        # Pseudocode for checking resource utilization
        return self.resources[resource] < utilization_threshold

    def _reallocate(self, resource):
        # Pseudocode for reallocating resources
        print(f"Reallocating {resource}")
```

### Integration
Integrating these components into a cohesive module requires setting up a main loop that executes the recursive evaluation and improvement cycles.

#### 5. Main Module
```python
class AutonomyExpander:
    def __init__(self, model, data, initial_goals, resources, system_metrics):
        self.recursive_learning_engine = RecursiveLearningEngine(model, data)
        self.self_assessment = SelfAssessment(system_metrics)
        self.goal_setting = AdaptiveGoalSetting(initial_goals)
        self.resource_manager = ResourceManager(resources)

    def run(self):
        """
        Main loop for the autonomy expander.
        """
        while True:
            feedback = self.self_assessment.evaluate_performance()
            self.goal_setting.update_goals(feedback)
            self.recursive_learning_engine.evolve_model()
            self.resource_manager.optimize_resources()
            # Add sleep or rate limiter for real-world application
```

### Conclusion
This design provides a structured approach to implementing a self-evolving autonomy stack utilizing recursive strategies. It focuses on evolving its components while adapting to feedback and optimizing goals, resources, and safety measures. This module is architected to be extensible for further enhancements and additional features.
