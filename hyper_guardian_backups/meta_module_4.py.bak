Creating a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "Post-Turing Machine") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves designing a system that can autonomously improve and adapt over time. Let's outline a conceptual design for such a module:

### Module Name: `RecursiveAutoAdapt`

### Key Concepts and Features

1. **Recursive Learning:**
   - Implement recursive deep learning models that can refine their architecture and hyperparameters based on performance metrics.
   - Leverage libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch to build models that can self-evaluate and modify their own complexity.

2. **Self-Optimization:**
   - Use genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning paradigms where the strategy itself can evolve recursively.
   - Implement Bayesian optimization techniques to tune hyperparameters based on feedback loops from model performance.

3. **Adaptive Algorithms:**
   - Design algorithms that recursively adjust themselves to evolving data patterns and environmental conditions.
   - Use historical data to predict potential model improvements and implement changes autonomously.

4. **Knowledge Distillation and Transfer:**
   - Implement methods for models to recursively extract key insights and transfer knowledge between generations of architectures.
   - Facilitate continuous learning by enabling old models to serve as teachers for new models.

5. **Scalability and Parallel Processing:**
   - Ensure that the recursive strategies can run on scalable infrastructure, leveraging cloud-based services like AWS Lambda for serverless execution.
   - Implement parallel processing to allow multiple recursive strategies to test hypotheses concurrently.

6. **Anomaly Detection and Correction:**
   - Integrate recursive anomaly detection systems that can identify when a model is underperforming and implement corrective measures.
   - Use statistical methods and machine learning to predict and rectify anomalies.

### Sample Code Structure

Here's a rough outline for the `RecursiveAutoAdapt` module in Python:

```python
# `RecursiveAutoAdapt` module

import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from PyTorch import SomeDeepLearningFramework

class RecursiveAutoAdapt:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize default model parameters and data
        self.model = self._initialize_model()
        self.data = self._load_data()
        
    def _initialize_model(self):
        # Initialize and return a neural network model
        return SomeDeepLearningFramework.Model()

    def _load_data(self):
        # Load and return dataset
        return np.load('data.npy')

    def recursive_learning(self, generations=10):
        # Implement recursive model training
        for generation in range(generations):
            print(f"Generation: {generation}")
            self.model = self._train_and_evolve(self.model)
            self._evaluate_model()
            # Self-modification based on evaluation

    def _train_and_evolve(self, model):
        # Train and refine the model
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(self.data['features'], self.data['labels'])
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
        # Recursively modify and evolve the model
        model = self._recursive_modification(model)
        return model

    def _recursive_modification(self, model):
        # Logic to modify model recursively
        # Example: Adjust layers, change activation functions, etc.
        return model

    def _evaluate_model(self):
        # Model evaluation logic
        predictions = self.model.predict(self.data['features_test'])
        accuracy = accuracy_score(self.data['labels_test'], predictions)
        print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")
        
    def recursive_optimization(self):
        # Implement optimization logic
        pass

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    raas = RecursiveAutoAdapt()
    raas.recursive_learning()
```

### Additional Considerations

- **Ethical and Safety Constraints:** Implement safety checks to ensure recursive changes do not lead to unethical decisions or unsafe operations.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Continuously log decisions and model changes to allow for retrospective analysis and debugging.
- **User Interface:** Design a visualization tool for users to monitor the evolution of autonomy systems effectively.

This theoretical module offers a foundational approach to building a self-evolving autonomy stack in the PTM empire while incorporating recursive strategies for adaptability and constant improvement.
