Designing a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably a Placeholder Name for an organization or system) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a framework that allows autonomous components to learn, adapt, and optimize themselves over time. This can be achieved through novel recursive strategies. Below is an overview of how such a module might be structured, along with key features and a basic example of the implementation outline in Python.

### Objectives:
1. **Self-Evaluation and Adaptation:** Components must assess their performance and adapt based on metrics.
2. **Recursive Learning:** Implement recursive algorithms that refine themselves.
3. **Modularity:** Ensure components can be easily added or replaced.
4. **Scalability:** Handle increasing complexity efficiently.

### Module Design:

1. **Core Components:**
    - **Self-Evaluator:** Monitors and evaluates component performance.
    - **Recursive Learner:** Utilizes recursive algorithms for continuous improvement.
    - **Adaptation Engine:** Implements changes based on evaluations.
    - **Communication Interface:** Facilitates interaction between components.

2. **Key Features:**
    - **Dynamic Goal Setting:** Adjust goals based on environment feedback.
    - **Model Mutation:** Iteratively refine algorithms using genetic programming concepts.
    - **Feedback Loops:** Incorporate continuous feedback loops for real-time adaptation.
    - **Parallel Processing:** Utilize concurrent executions for efficiency.

3. **Recursive Strategy Concepts:**
    - **Recursive Reinforcement Learning:** Where actions are evaluated at multiple depths.
    - **Tree-Based Structures:** Employ decision trees or neural networks that restructure themselves.
    - **Recursive Data Augmentation:** Enhance learning by generating synthetic data recursively.

### Example Implementation

```python
import numpy as np
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

class SelfEvaluator:
    def evaluate(self, performance_metrics):
        return np.mean(performance_metrics)

class RecursiveLearner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_model = self.initialize_model()

    def initialize_model(self):
        # Placeholder for model initialization
        return "Initial Model"

    def recursive_optimize(self, data):
        # Simulate recursive optimization (Placeholder logic)
        print("Optimizing model recursively")
        return f"{self.current_model} -> Optimized"

class AdaptationEngine:
    def adapt(self, model, evaluation_score):
        # Adapt model based on evaluation (Placeholder logic)
        if evaluation_score < 0.8:
            print("Adapting model for better performance")
            return f"{model} -> Adapted"
        return model

class AutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.self_evaluator = SelfEvaluator()
        self.recursive_learner = RecursiveLearner()
        self.adaptation_engine = AdaptationEngine()

    def process_data(self, data):
        # Example processing and recursive learning
        optimized_model = self.recursive_learner.recursive_optimize(data)
        performance_score = self.self_evaluator.evaluate(data)
        adapted_model = self.adaptation_engine.adapt(optimized_model, performance_score)
        print(f"Final Model State: {adapted_model}")

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    stack = AutonomyStack()
    sample_data = np.random.rand(100)
    stack.process_data(sample_data)
```

### Additional Considerations:
- **Distributed Systems:** Consider using frameworks like Ray or Dask for handling large-scale distributed processing.
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** Leverage libraries like TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for recursive learning implementations.
- **Security:** Ensure the systemâ€™s adaptability does not expose it to vulnerabilities.

### Conclusion:
The design focuses on creating an adaptive system that learns and evolves recursively. By leveraging recursive learning strategies, the autonomy stack can potentially discover new methods and models, enhancing the PTM empire's capabilities. This module can be expanded to incorporate more complex algorithms, integrations, and real-time processing to fit specific application needs.
