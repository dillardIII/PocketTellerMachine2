Creating a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional or conceptual entity) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves several considerations. At its core, this module will likely focus on self-improvement, adaptation, and evolution within a software system. Given the scope of a question like this, here's a high-level design of the module and some details on innovative recursive strategies for an evolving autonomy stack.

### Module Overview

We'll call this module `autonomy_expansion`. The module's purpose is to enhance the self-evolving capabilities of a system by implementing recursive strategies and learning mechanisms.

### Key Components

1. **Data Gathering and Analysis**: Collect and analyze data to understand the system's current performance and areas that need improvement.
   
2. **Recursive Learning Engine**: Employ recursive strategies that allow functions and processes to adjust based on feedback.

3. **Self-enhancement Algorithms**: Implement algorithms that enable the system to propose modifications that could improve its own operation.

4. **Reinforcement and Evolution**: Use reinforcement learning and evolutionary programming techniques to test, validate, and deploy improvements.

5. **Autonomy Governance**: A governance mechanism to ensure the system's evolution remains aligned with overarching goals.

6. **Safety and Ethics**: Built-in considerations for safety and ethical boundaries to maintain user trust and prevent unintended consequences.

### Recursive Strategies

- **Feedback Loops**: Develop continuous feedback loops where system outputs are used to improve the system's functions. For instance, model predictions are analyzed and the errors inform updates to the model.

- **AutoML**: Implement automated machine learning where the system explores different models and configurations to achieve optimal performance.

- **Meta-learning**: Enable the system to learn how to learn. This involves creating algorithms that become better at selecting tasks or models based on past experiences.

### Example Code Structure

```python
# autonomy_expansion/__init__.py

# Import essential components
from .data_analysis import DataGathering
from .recursive_learning import RecursiveLearner
from .enhancement import AutoEnhancer
from .governance_level1 import GovernanceEngine
from .safety_measures import SafetyCompliance

# Initialize the main components
def initialize_system():
    data_module = DataGathering()
    learning_module = RecursiveLearner()
    enhancer_module = AutoEnhancer()
    governance_module = GovernanceEngine()
    safety_module = SafetyCompliance()
    
    # Starting the data gathering process
    data_module.collect_data()

    # Run recursive learning procedures
    learning_module.run_learning()

    # Execute self-enhancement measures
    enhancer_module.enhance_system()

    # Ensure compliance with governance
    governance_module.enforce_policies()

    # Safety checks
    safety_module.check_system()
    
# Main entry point
if __name__ == "__main__":
    initialize_system()
```

### Component Details

1. **DataGathering**: Focuses on efficiently collecting and preprocessing data from various system parts to inform the learning and enhancement modules.

2. **RecursiveLearner**: Implements the recursive learning strategies using advanced algorithms, perhaps deep reinforcement learning.

3. **AutoEnhancer**: Analyzes model performance and uses operations research methods or gradient descent to suggest improvements.

4. **GovernanceEngine**: Uses constraints and policy-based algorithms to align autonomous operations with organizational goals.

5. **SafetyCompliance**: Ensures that all actions conform to safety protocols and ethical guidelines.

### Considerations

- **Scalability**: Ensure the module can scale with the complexity of tasks.
- **Robust Testing**: Implement a robust testing framework to evaluate new iterations thoroughly.

This design creates a foundation for an innovative self-evolving autonomy stack that leverages recursive strategies. It's only a blueprint and would require fleshing out each component with comprehensive logic, techniques specific to your domain, and continuous calibration based on experimental results.
