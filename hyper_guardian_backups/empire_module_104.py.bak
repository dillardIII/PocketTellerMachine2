Creating an advanced Python module for a hypothetical "unstoppable PTM empire" that utilizes intelligent recursion requires some creativity and imagination. We can design a module named `ptm_empire` that simulates an empire's growth through recursive strategies. The module can include functionalities like strategic expansion, resource management, and recursive leadership growth.

Below, I'll write the initial version of this module, focusing on a recursive strategy pattern for expanding territories and recursively optimizing resources.

```python
# ptm_empire.py
from collections import defaultdict
import random

class Territory:
    def __init__(self, name, resources):
        self.name = name
        self.resources = resources
        self.neighbors = []

    def add_neighbor(self, territory):
        if territory not in self.neighbors:
            self.neighbors.append(territory)
            territory.add_neighbor(self)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Territory({self.name}, Resources: {self.resources})"


class Empire:
    def __init__(self, name, starting_territories=None):
        self.name = name
        self.territories = starting_territories if starting_territories else []

    def find_territory(self, name):
        for territory in self.territories:
            if territory.name == name:
                return territory
        return None

    def expand_territory(self, territory, depth=2):
        """Recursively expand and add new territories based on available neighbors."""
        if depth <= 0:
            return

        for neighbor in territory.neighbors:
            if neighbor not in self.territories:
                self.territories.append(neighbor)
                print(f"Expanded to {neighbor.name}")
                self.expand_territory(neighbor, depth - 1)

    def optimize_resources(self, territory, depth=2):
        """Recursively optimize resources in a territory and its neighbors."""
        if depth <= 0:
            return 0

        resource_gain = territory.resources * 0.1  # Simplified resource optimization formula
        print(f"Optimizing {territory.name}: Gain {resource_gain:.2f} units")

        total_gain = resource_gain
        for neighbor in territory.neighbors:
            total_gain += self.optimize_resources(neighbor, depth - 1)

        return total_gain

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Empire({self.name}, Territories: {len(self.territories)})"


def generate_random_territory(name):
    resources = random.randint(100, 1000)
    return Territory(name, resources)


def create_sample_empire():
    # Create sample territories
    territory_names = ["TerrA", "TerrB", "TerrC", "TerrD", "TerrE"]
    territories = [generate_random_territory(name) for name in territory_names]

    # Define relationships (neighbors)
    territories[0].add_neighbor(territories[1])
    territories[1].add_neighbor(territories[2])
    territories[2].add_neighbor(territories[3])
    territories[3].add_neighbor(territories[4])

    # Initialize the empire with a starting territory
    ptm_empire = Empire("PTM Empire", [territories[0]])

    return ptm_empire


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a sample empire
    empire = create_sample_empire()

    print(f"Initial State: {empire}")

    # Start expansion from the first territory
    print("\nExpanding Empire:")
    empire.expand_territory(empire.territories[0])

    # Optimizing resources starting from the first territory
    print("\nOptimizing Resources:")
    empire.optimize_resources(empire.territories[0])

    print(f"\nFinal State: {empire}")
```

### Module Explanation:
1. **Territory Class:** Represents a territory with a name, resources, and neighboring territories. Neighbors are added bidirectionally for symmetry.
   
2. **Empire Class:** Represents the empire, containing functionalities for expanding territories and optimizing resources. Utilizes recursion to explore territories to expand and optimize resources.

3. **Recursive Expansion and Optimization:** Uses a depth-limited recursive approach to both expand and optimize, allowing for strategic adjustments.

4. **Sample Empire Creation:** Demonstrates how the module could be used with randomly generated territories and starting conditions.

This module can be further expanded with more sophisticated strategies, resource types, and intelligence algorithms as the needs of the PTM empire evolve.
