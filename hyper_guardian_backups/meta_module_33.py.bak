Designing a new Python module for expanding the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies requires a well-thought-out architecture. The module would need to incorporate recursive functions, machine learning techniques, and self-improvement mechanisms. Here’s an outline and a foundational code structure for this module:

### Module Design: AutonomyExpansion

#### Key Components
1. **Self-Monitoring and Evaluation**
   - Track performance metrics of algorithms and identify potential areas of improvement.
  
2. **Recursive Learning Algorithms**
   - Implement recursive functions to re-train and fine-tune models using historical performance data.
   
3. **Dynamic Architecture Adaption**
   - Allow the module to dynamically adjust its architecture based on task requirements.
  
4. **Feedback Loop Integration**
   - Establish robust feedback loops to facilitate self-improvement and adaptation.
  
5. **Redundancy and Reliability Layer**
   - Implement redundancy strategies to ensure reliability and consistency.

#### Core Classes and Functions

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, RegressorMixin
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from typing import Any, List, Tuple

class RecursiveModel:
    """
    A class that represents an evolving recursive model for autonomy expansion.
    """

    def __init__(self, base_model: BaseEstimator):
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.history = []
        self.performance_metrics = []

    def train(self, X: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> None:
        """Train the model on the provided data."""
        self.base_model.fit(X, y)
        self.history.append((X, y))

    def recursive_train(self) -> None:
        """Retrain the model recursively using history data."""
        for X, y in self.history:
            self.base_model.fit(X, y)

    def predict(self, X: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        """Generate predictions using the trained model."""
        return self.base_model.predict(X)

    def evaluate_performance(self, X_test: np.ndarray, y_test: np.ndarray) -> float:
        """Evaluate and store the model's performance."""
        predictions = self.predict(X_test)
        performance_metric = np.mean((predictions - y_test) ** 2)
        self.performance_metrics.append(performance_metric)
        return performance_metric

class DynamicArchitecture:
    """
    A class to represent a dynamic architecture that adapts to the task.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.models: List[RecursiveModel] = []

    def add_model(self, model: RecursiveModel) -> None:
        self.models.append(model)

    def adapt(self) -> None:
        """
        Adapt architecture based on performance metrics.
        """
        # Example strategy: Re-assign weights or switch models
        self.models.sort(key=lambda x: np.mean(x.performance_metrics))
        best_model = self.models[0]
        self.models = [best_model]
        # Further expansion needed based on specific criteria

# Example Usage
base_model = RandomForestRegressor()
recursive_model = RecursiveModel(base_model=base_model)
architecture = DynamicArchitecture()

# Add the model to dynamic architecture
architecture.add_model(recursive_model)

# Iterate over training data and simulate recursive learning
for epoch in range(5):
    X_train, y_train = # hypothetical training data
    X_test, y_test = # hypothetical testing data
    recursive_model.train(X_train, y_train)
    performance = recursive_model.evaluate_performance(X_test, y_test)
    print(f'Epoch {epoch}: Performance {performance}')

    # Adapting the architecture
    architecture.adapt()

    # Recursive Model Improvement
    recursive_model.recursive_train()

# Ensure you replace `# hypothetical data` with actual data loading process
```

### Summary

- **RecursiveModel**: Handles the training of machine learning models with the ability to retrain on historical data to improve performance continuously.
  
- **DynamicArchitecture**: Maintains a list of models, evaluates their performance, and dynamically adapts based on their success rate.

- Self-monitoring and evaluation are ingrained through performance metrics, allowing autonomous improvement loops.

This setup is extensible—consider integrating more advanced algorithms (e.g., Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning) to embed deeper learning and adaptive capabilities. Comprehensive data handling and pre-processing functions would be essential in a complete module.
