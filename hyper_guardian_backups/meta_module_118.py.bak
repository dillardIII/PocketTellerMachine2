Designing a new Python module for the PTM (Presumably a hypothetical autonomous system) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a software component that is capable of learning, adapting, and evolving its capabilities over time. This can be achieved using innovative recursive strategies that allow the system to build upon its existing knowledge. Below is a high-level design outline and some Python code snippets to illustrate the concept.

### High-Level Design

#### Objectives:
1. **Self-Learning Capabilities**: Implement machine learning techniques to enable the system to learn from its environment.
2. **Recursive Strategy Implementation**: Develop recursive functions that enhance decision-making processes.
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Facilitate a feedback loop that allows for continuous improvement.
4. **Scalability**: Ensure the module can scale with the addition of new data and functionalities.

#### Components:

1. **Data Collector**: Gathers data from various sensors and external sources.
2. **Learning Module**: Implements machine learning models to identify patterns and make predictions.
3. **Decision Engine**: Uses recursive strategies to make decisions based on the insights provided by the learning module.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Evaluates the outcomes of decisions to refine and improve algorithms.

### Python Module Design

```python
# Filename: ptm_autonomy.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

class PTMAutonomy:
    def __init__(self, data_sources):
        self.data_sources = data_sources
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier()
        self.feedback_log = []

    def gather_data(self):
        # Simulates data gathering from multiple sources
        data = []
        labels = []
        for source in self.data_sources:
            source_data, source_labels = source.get_data()
            data.extend(source_data)
            labels.extend(source_labels)
        return np.array(data), np.array(labels)

    def learn(self):
        # Learning from the gathered data
        data, labels = self.gather_data()
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, labels, test_size=0.2)
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        accuracy = self.model.score(X_test, y_test)
        print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

    def recursive_strategy(self, depth, max_depth):
        if depth >= max_depth:
            return "Base decision reached"
        # A simple recursive strategy to make a decision
        current_state = self.evaluate_state()
        
        decision = "Make a decision based on current state"
        outcome = self.decide(current_state)
        
        self.feedback_log.append((current_state, decision, outcome))
        return self.recursive_strategy(depth + 1, max_depth)

    def evaluate_state(self):
        # Simulate state evaluation
        return "Evaluated state"

    def decide(self, state):
        # Mock decision function, could implement logic using model predictions
        return self.model.predict([state])[0] if state else None

    def feedback_loop(self):
        for state, decision, outcome in self.feedback_log:
            self.model.partial_fit([state], [outcome])  # Improves model incrementally
            print(f"Feedback processed for decision {decision}")
        self.feedback_log.clear()

# Example data source class
class DataSource:
    def get_data(self):
        # Simulate data and labels
        data = np.random.rand(10, 5)
        labels = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(10,))
        return data, labels

# Using the module
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sources = [DataSource(), DataSource()]
    ptm = PTMAutonomy(sources)
    ptm.learn()
    decision = ptm.recursive_strategy(0, 3)
    print(decision)
    ptm.feedback_loop()
```

### Key Features

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Uses a RandomForestClassifier to learn from data.
- **Recursive Strategies**: Demonstrated through a recursive function for decision-making.
- **Feedback Loop**: Provides a mechanism for the system to learn from past decisions for continuous improvement.
- **Mock Data Source**: Simplifies simulation and testing of data collection.

### Extension Points

- Integrate advanced neural networks for more complex learning tasks.
- Expand data sources to include real-time and more diverse data inputs.
- Enhance recursive decision-making logic to consider more complex scenarios.
- Implement persistent storage for the model to maintain learning across sessions.

This module offers a foundational structure that can be further expanded with more sophisticated algorithms and external integrations to enhance the autonomy stack's self-evolving capabilities.
