Creating an advanced Python module with intelligent recursion involves designing a module that efficiently handles recursive tasks with optimizations like memoization, intelligent base case detection, and dynamic adjustment of recursion strategy. Below is an example of such a module, which includes a few advanced techniques to optimize recursive functions.

```python
"""
Intelligent Recursion Module for PTM Empire

This module provides utilities for performing recursion intelligently and efficiently.
It includes memoization, dynamic adjustment strategies, and sophisticated base case analysis.

### Key Features Explained:

1. **Memoization**:
   - `@lru_cache`: Decorator to cache function results to make recursive calls more efficient.
   - `_memo` Dictionary: Used in the `fibonacci` function to store results of already computed fibonacci numbers.
   
2. **Dynamic Optimization**:
   - `detect_optimal_method`: Decides whether to use recursion or iteration based on the input size. For small sizes, recursion is preferred, whereas iteration is used when recursion may lead to maximum recursion depth exceeded errors.

3. **Logging and Timing**:
   - Decorators are used to measure function execution time and log useful information for debugging or performance tracking.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The module checks for invalid inputs such as negative numbers for factorial.

This module serves as a flexible tool to solve recursion problems more efficiently and reliably in different scenarios for the PTM empire and can be expanded with more sophisticated strategies.
