Designing an innovative Python module for expanding the PTM (Presumably the name of a fictional empire or company) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that is capable of learning, evolving, and improving autonomously. The autonomy stack can be aimed at various applications, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, or intelligent systems. Below, I'll outline a conceptual design for a Python module that incorporates recursive strategies to achieve this.

### Module: RecursiveAutonomy

#### Key Features:
- **Self-Learning and Adaptation:** The system should be able to adapt to changes in its environment using reinforcement learning and other adaptive algorithms.
- **Recursive Improvement:** Implement algorithms that allow the system to iterate over its own processes to find improvements continuously.
- **Scalability:** Design the system to easily integrate with existing modules and scale with the growth of data and application complexity.
- **Resource Efficiency:** Optimize for minimal use of computational and memory resources.

#### Core Components:
1. **Environment Simulator:**
   - Simulate multiple environments where the system can test and learn from different scenarios.
   - Support for real-world data input and synthetic data generation for edge cases.

2. **Recursive Learning Agent:**
   - Utilize reinforcement learning, specifically model-based methods, which allow recursive planning and learning.
   - Implement meta-learning techniques to improve the learning process itself.

3. **Feedback Loop:**
   - Continuously collect data on performance and environmental changes.
   - Recursive analysis to identify patterns, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement.

4. **Evolutionary Algorithm Engine:**
   - Employ genetic algorithms and evolutionary strategies to explore variations and mutations in the operational logic.
   - Automatic selection of optimal strategies based on performance evaluations.

5. **Modular Architecture:**
   - Use plugin architecture to allow the seamless addition of new components and strategies.
   - Leverage community-developed plugins for extended capabilities.

6. **Resource Management:**
   - Implement dynamic resource allocation to optimize computational usage.
   - Use of lightweight data structures to improve efficiency.

```python
# RecursiveAutonomy Module Skeleton

class EnvironmentSimulator:
    def __init__(self, configuration):
        self.environments = self.initialize_environments(configuration)

    def initialize_environments(self, configuration):
        # Initialize simulated environments
        pass

    def run_simulation(self, agent):
        # Run simulations using the agent
        pass

class RecursiveLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize agent's learning structure and parameters
        pass

    def learn(self, environment):
        # Recursive learning strategy implementation
        pass

    def meta_learn(self):
        # Improve the learning process itself
        pass

class FeedbackLoop:
    def __init__(self, agent, environment_simulator):
        self.agent = agent
        self.environment_simulator = environment_simulator

    def analyze_performance(self):
        # Analyze the performance and provide feedback
        pass

    def apply_improvements(self):
        # Use feedback to make recursive improvements
        pass

class EvolutionaryAlgorithmEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the evolutionary algorithm parameters
        pass

    def evolve(self, agent):
        # Apply genetic algorithms for recursive improvement
        pass

class ResourceManagement:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize resource management parameters
        pass

    def optimize_resources(self):
        # Optimize resource usage
        pass

# Main module class
class RecursiveAutonomy:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.environment_simulator = EnvironmentSimulator(config)
        self.agent = RecursiveLearningAgent()
        self.feedback_loop = FeedbackLoop(self.agent, self.environment_simulator)
        self.evolution_engine = EvolutionaryAlgorithmEngine()
        self.resource_manager = ResourceManagement()

    def run(self):
        # Execute the autonomy stack
        while True:
            self.environment_simulator.run_simulation(self.agent)
            self.agent.learn(self.environment_simulator)
            self.feedback_loop.analyze_performance()
            self.feedback_loop.apply_improvements()
            self.evolution_engine.evolve(self.agent)
            self.resource_manager.optimize_resources()

# Example execution script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    config = {}  # Define the necessary configuration
    autonomy_system = RecursiveAutonomy(config)
    autonomy_system.run()
```

### Considerations:
- **Interoperability:** Ensure the module supports interfaced communication with other systems and protocols.
- **Safety and Ethics:** Consider implementing safety measures and ethical guidelines to prevent harmful behavior from autonomous systems.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Incorporate comprehensive monitoring and logging features to track the system's decisions and actions.
