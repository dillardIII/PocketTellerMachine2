Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional entity for this example) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a deep integration of cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and recursive algorithms. Below, I'll provide a conceptual overview and sample implementation that could serve as a foundation for this module.

### Module Concept: Recursive Autonomous Decision-Making (RAD)

**Purpose**: To enable autonomous systems within the PTM empire to make independent decisions that evolve over time by recursively improving their own decision-making processes.

#### Features:

1. **Recursive Learning**: Implement a recursive approach where the system continually refines and retrains its decision-making process based on new data and previous outcomes.

2. **Self-Assessment**: Periodically evaluate decision efficiency using key performance metrics and adjust the strategy accordingly to optimize future decision-making.

3. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Facilitate communication and strategy-sharing among multiple autonomous agents to enhance the learning process across the system.

4. **Contextual Adaptation**: Enable the system to adapt to different environments and situations in real-time.

5. **Safety and Compliance**: Ensure decisions comply with predefined safety and ethical guidelines.

### Python Module: rad_autonomy

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

class RecursiveDecisionMaker:
    def __init__(self, initial_data, initial_labels):
        self.data = initial_data
        self.labels = initial_labels
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier()
        self.training_iterations = 0

    def train(self):
        """Train model on current data and labels."""
        self.model.fit(self.data, self.labels)
        self.training_iterations += 1

    def evaluate(self, test_data, test_labels):
        """Evaluate the model with test data and adjust strategies."""
        predictions = self.model.predict(test_data)
        acc = accuracy_score(test_labels, predictions)
        print(f"Evaluation Accuracy: {acc}")
        
        # Recursive improvement based on evaluation performance
        if acc < self.target_accuracy():
            self.refine_model(test_data, test_labels)

    def target_accuracy(self):
        """Determine dynamic target accuracy based on iteration."""
        # Example strategy for dynamic target accuracy
        return 0.9 - 0.01 * self.training_iterations

    def refine_model(self, additional_data, additional_labels):
        """Improve model performance by retraining with new data."""
        self.data = np.vstack((self.data, additional_data))
        self.labels = np.concatenate((self.labels, additional_labels))
        self.train()

    def self_assess(self):
        """Periodically check the model's performance."""
        # Implement periodic assessment logic
        pass

    def get_decision(self, input_features):
        """Make an autonomous decision based on the model."""
        return self.model.predict([input_features])

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    initial_data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    initial_labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

    # Initialize and train the recursive decision-maker
    rad = RecursiveDecisionMaker(initial_data, initial_labels)
    rad.train()

    # Test with new data
    test_data = np.random.rand(20, 10)
    test_labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 20)
    rad.evaluate(test_data, test_labels)

    # Make a decision based on new input
    new_decision = rad.get_decision(np.random.rand(10))
    print(f"Decision: {new_decision}")
```

### Key Points:

1. **Recursive Learning & Evaluation**: The module includes continuous monitoring of its performance and triggers a retraining process whenever it underperforms.

2. **Dynamic Goal Setting**: Introduces a dynamic target accuracy that adapts based on the number of training iterations, allowing the system to set and strive for realistic goals.

3. **Integration for Multi-Agent Systems**: While not fully implemented in this snippet, the architecture is designed to be expanded to facilitate interaction with other autonomous agents.

4. **Scalability & Flexibility**: The module is flexible enough to be scaled as more data or more complex decisions are required.

This initial implementation provides a base that can be expanded upon with more robust machine learning algorithms, optimization strategies, and safety checks specific to the PTM empireâ€™s needs.
