Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional empire for this exercise) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves incorporating innovative concepts and strategies that promote adaptability and continuous learning. This module must utilize recursive strategies to allow the system to evolve and optimize itself autonomously. Here’s a conceptual design outline for such a module:

### Module: PTM_Evolve

#### Key Components:
1. **Self-Monitoring System**: Continuously examines the performance of different system components and identifies areas for improvement.
   
2. **Recursive Learning Algorithms**: Implements algorithms that employ recursion to refine and optimize decision-making over successive iterations.

3. **Adaptive Knowledge Base**: Maintains and updates a repository of knowledge and experiences to inform future actions.

4. **Dynamic Strategy Generation**: Formulates and evaluates new strategies on-the-fly, recursively enhancing them based on feedback and outcomes.

5. **Simulated Evolution Environment**: Creates virtual scenarios to test and evolve strategies without affecting real-world operations.

6. **Feedback Loop Integrator**: Gathers and incorporates external feedback to refine recursive learning and adaptive strategies.

7. **Autonomy Analytics Dashboard**: Visualizes the evolution and performance metrics to provide insights and drive improvements.

#### Implementation Outline:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import random

# Core class defining the autonomy stack
class AutonomyEvolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_base = {}
        self.strategy_pool = []
        self.performance_history = []

    def monitor_system(self):
        # Simulate monitoring system metrics
        performance_metrics = {"metric1": random.uniform(0, 1), "metric2": random.uniform(0, 1)}
        self.performance_history.append(performance_metrics)
        return performance_metrics

    def recursive_learning(self, depth=5, threshold=0.8):
        if depth == 0:
            return self.evaluate_current_strategies()

        new_strategies = self.generate_new_strategies()
        best_strategy = None
        best_score = 0

        for strategy in new_strategies:
            score = self.simulate_strategy(strategy)
            if score > best_score:
                best_score = score
                best_strategy = strategy

        if best_score < threshold:
            return self.recursive_learning(depth - 1, threshold)

        self.strategy_pool.append(best_strategy)
        return best_strategy

    def generate_new_strategies(self):
        # Generates new strategies based on existing knowledge and random perturbations
        new_strategies = [{"strategy": "New_Strategy", "param1": random.uniform(0,1)} for _ in range(5)]
        return new_strategies

    def simulate_strategy(self, strategy):
        # Simulate the outcome of a strategy (a stub for an actual simulation)
        return random.uniform(0,1)

    def evaluate_current_strategies(self):
        # Evaluate the performance of current strategies using historical data
        evaluation = {"strategy_performance": np.mean([x["metric1"] for x in self.performance_history])}
        return evaluation

    def integrate_feedback(self, external_feedback):
        # Incorporate external feedback into the learning system
        self.knowledge_base.update(external_feedback)

    def evolve_system(self):
        # Main loop to evolve the system
        for _ in range(10):  # Arbitrary number of iterations
            self.monitor_system()
            best_strategy = self.recursive_learning()
            print(f"Adopted Strategy: {best_strategy}")

# Autonomous system controller
autonomy_system = AutonomyEvolver()
autonomy_system.evolve_system()
```

### Key Features and Considerations:

1. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Recursive strategies ensure the system continuously adapts to changes and unknown variables.
   
2. **Scalability**: The design should accommodate the inclusion of additional strategies and simulation scenarios.

3. **Feedback Loops**: Integrate both internal and external feedback boundaries to ensure comprehensive system refinement.

4. **Simulated Environments**: Leverage virtual scenarios to minimize risk during the evolution process, allowing safe experimentation.

5. **Transparency and Auditability**: The Autonomy Analytics Dashboard should allow stakeholders to visualize changes and understand the decision-making rationale.

6. **Security**: Ensure the module is equipped with mechanisms to safeguard against malicious adaptations or cyber threats.

This modular approach provides a foundation for developing a highly autonomous and self-evolving system aligned with the PTM empire’s needs. Remember, testing in safe simulated environments is vital before any real-world application.
