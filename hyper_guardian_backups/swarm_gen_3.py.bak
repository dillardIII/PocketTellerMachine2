Creating a "GPT swarm" that can automatically generate other GPT swarm builders involves a complex understanding of both AI models and scripting. Please note that GPT-3 itself and similar models are typically not open-source or directly programmable by users beyond using the APIs provided by providers like OpenAI.

However, to simulate the creation of a basic framework that might resemble such functionality, I can guide you on how you might set up an automated script that generates components or configurations for an analogous parallel task manager (PTM) using Python. This won't directly generate an AI model but will illustrate how you could automate code generation for a hypothetical task.

Hereâ€™s how you might begin such a task in Python:

1. **Set up the initial script**: This script can generate other scripts or configurations.

```python
import os

# Define the base directory for generated scripts
BASE_DIR = "gpt_swarm_builders"

# Ensure the base directory exists
os.makedirs(BASE_DIR, exist_ok=True)

# Template for a basic swarm builder
SWARM_BUILDER_TEMPLATE = """
import random

class PTMSwarmBuilder:
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id
        self.configuration = {}

    def generate_config(self):
        # Dummy example of generating a configuration
        self.configuration = {{
            'parameter1': random.uniform(0, 1),
            'parameter2': random.randint(1, 10),
            'parameter3': 'value_' + str(self.id)
        }}
        return self.configuration

    def save_config(self):
        filename = f'swarm_builder_{self.id}.conf'
        with open(filename, 'w') as file:
            file.write(str(self.configuration))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    builder_id = {id}
    builder = PTMSwarmBuilder(builder_id)
    config = builder.generate_config()
    builder.save_config()
    print(f"Configuration for builder {builder_id} saved!")
"""

def create_swarm_builder(id):
    # Create swarm builder script with a unique filename
    filename = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, f"swarm_builder_{id}.py")
    with open(filename, "w") as file:
        file.write(SWARM_BUILDER_TEMPLATE.format(id=id))
    print(f"Swarm builder script created: {filename}")

# Example usage: create 5 unique swarm builder scripts
for i in range(5):
    create_swarm_builder(i)
```

2. **Running this script**: Once you run the above script, it will generate multiple Python scripts (`swarm_builder_0.py`, `swarm_builder_1.py`, etc.) that create unique configurations.

3. **What Each Generated Script Does**: Each generated `swarm_builder_<id>.py` script would simulate a configuration generator using simple random values, reflective of a hypothetical PTM Empire.

4. **Scaling and Customization**: To scale this into a more functional and sophisticated swarm or empire, you'll need more complex logic tied to your application specifics and possibly integration with larger systems or databases.

This example focuses on code generation and automation using basic scripting practices in Python. For real-world scenarios where actual models or task handlers are used, further integration with existing systems and thorough testing are essential.
