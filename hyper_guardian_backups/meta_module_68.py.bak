Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack with innovative recursive strategies involves creating a system that can learn and adapt over time. Below is a conceptual outline for a Python module, named `EvoStack`. This module will implement recursive strategies for self-improvement and autonomous decision-making.

```python
# evo_stack.py

import random
import logging
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Set up logging for debug purposes
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

class EvolutionaryAlgorithm(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for evolutionary algorithms."""

    @abstractmethod
    def initialize_population(self):
        """Initialize the population."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def fitness(self, candidate):
        """Evaluate the fitness of a candidate solution."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def selection(self):
        """Select candidates for reproduction."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def crossover(self, parent1, parent2):
        """Combine two parents to produce offspring."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def mutation(self, candidate):
        """Mutate a candidate solution."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def evolve(self):
        """Run the evolutionary process."""
        pass


class RecursiveStrategy(EvolutionaryAlgorithm):
    """Implement recursive strategies for self-improvement using evolutionary algorithms."""

    def __init__(self, population_size, generations, mutation_rate):
        self.population_size = population_size
        self.generations = generations
        self.mutation_rate = mutation_rate
        self.population = []

    def initialize_population(self):
        logging.debug("Initializing population")
        self.population = [[random.randint(0, 1) for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(self.population_size)]

    def fitness(self, candidate):
        logging.debug(f"Calculating fitness for candidate: {candidate}")
        return sum(candidate)  # Simple fitness: sum of bits

    def selection(self):
        logging.debug("Selecting candidates for reproduction")
        sorted_population = sorted(self.population, key=self.fitness, reverse=True)
        return sorted_population[:2]  # Select top 2 candidates

    def crossover(self, parent1, parent2):
        logging.debug(f"Performing crossover between {parent1} and {parent2}")
        crossover_point = random.randint(0, len(parent1) - 1)
        child1 = parent1[:crossover_point] + parent2[crossover_point:]
        child2 = parent2[:crossover_point] + parent1[crossover_point:]
        return child1, child2

    def mutation(self, candidate):
        logging.debug(f"Mutating candidate: {candidate}")
        for i in range(len(candidate)):
            if random.random() < self.mutation_rate:
                candidate[i] = 1 if candidate[i] == 0 else 0  # Flip bit
        return candidate

    def evolve(self):
        self.initialize_population()
        for generation in range(self.generations):
            logging.info(f"Generation {generation + 1}")
            parents = self.selection()
            offspring = []
            while len(offspring) < self.population_size:
                child1, child2 = self.crossover(parents[0], parents[1])
                offspring.append(self.mutation(child1))
                if len(offspring) < self.population_size:
                    offspring.append(self.mutation(child2))
            self.population = offspring
            best = max(self.population, key=self.fitness)
            logging.info(f"Best candidate: {best}, Fitness: {self.fitness(best)}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Sample parameters: 100 population size, 10 generations, 0.1 mutation rate
    strategy = RecursiveStrategy(population_size=100, generations=10, mutation_rate=0.1)
    strategy.evolve()
```

### Key Features

1. **Evolutionary Algorithm Design:** A class named `EvolutionaryAlgorithm` acts as an abstract base that defines the structure for evolutionary operations such as initialization, selection, crossover, and mutation.

2. **Recursive Strategy Integration:** Implements a concrete class `RecursiveStrategy` that applies evolutionary techniques to simulate self-improvement using recursive optimization.

3. **Self-Evolving System:** This module initializes with a population and iteratively improves the group through evolutionary processes, allowing the system to self-evolve towards better solutions.

4. **Configurability:** Flexibility in setting population size, generations, and mutation rates, making the system adaptable to various scenarios.

5. **Logging and Debugging:** Provides detailed logging at each step to track the internal state and evolutionary process, assisting in debugging and analysis.

### Future Enhancements

- **Recursive Acclimatization:** Implement dynamic adjustment of mutation rates based on performance trends.
- **Multi-objective Optimization:** Extend the system to handle multiple objectives using Pareto front methods.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Use ML models to estimate fitness functions with complex, dynamic tasks.

By using a blend of evolutionary and recursive strategies, this module can significantly boost the autonomy stack's ability to self-evolve and optimize over time.
