Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably referring to a hypothetical empire with self-evolving autonomy stack) involves integrating innovative recursive strategies to enhance autonomy, adaptability, and self-improvement. Below is an outline and some basic ideas for such a module. Note that this concept is abstract and will need to be adapted to the specific goals and infrastructure of the PTM empire.

### PTM Autonomy Expansion Module (PTM_AEM)

#### Overview

The PTM_AEM module leverages recursive strategies to enhance decision-making, adaptability, and learning in autonomous systems. The module introduces mechanisms to allow components of the PTM autonomy stack to improve themselves over time.

#### Key Features

1. **Recursive Learning Engine (RLE):** 
   - Implements recursive learning loops that allow systems to refine their models incrementally.
   - Utilizes reinforcement learning and online learning.
   - Supports transfer learning to propagate successful strategies across different domains.

2. **Self-Optimization Framework (SOF):** 
   - Automates parameter tuning and architecture adjustments using metaheuristic algorithms.
   - Includes genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and gradient-free optimization techniques.

3. **Dynamic Reconfiguration Component (DRC):** 
   - Allows systems to reconfigure their architecture based on performance metrics.
   - Uses control theory and feedback loops for real-time adaptive behavior.
   - Employs digital twins for simulation-based scenario testing.

4. **Autonomy Verification and Validation (AVV):**
   - Implements recursive verification techniques to ensure reliability.
   - Employs formal methods for autonomous system validation.
   - Automates testing processes using mutation testing and symbolic execution.

5. **Collaborative Intelligence Interface (CII):**
   - Facilitates information sharing between autonomous systems for collective learning.
   - Implements distributed learning algorithms such as federated learning.
   - Enhances decision-making by integrating swarm intelligence and consensus mechanisms.

### Sample Implementation

Below is a simplified version of what some components of the PTM_AEM might look like in Python.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin

class RecursiveLearner(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
    def __init__(self, model, learning_rate=0.01):
        self.model = model
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate

    def fit(self, X, y, iterations=10):
        for i in range(iterations):
            self.model.fit(X, y)
            predictions = self.model.predict(X)
            error = np.mean(predictions != y)
            print(f"Iteration {i+1}/{iterations}, Error: {error}")
            self.adjust_model(error)

    def adjust_model(self, error):
        """ Recursively adjust model parameters to minimize error. """
        if error > 0.1:  # Arbitrary threshold
            # Example: Scaling learning rate based on error severity
            self.learning_rate *= 0.95

    def predict(self, X):
        return self.model.predict(X)

class SelfOptimizer:
    def optimize(self, config_space, evaluate_func, max_iter=100):
        best_config = None
        best_score = float('inf')
        # Example of a simple optimization loop
        for _ in range(max_iter):
            config = self.sample_config(config_space)
            score = evaluate_func(config)
            if score < best_score:
                best_score = score
                best_config = config
        return best_config

    def sample_config(self, config_space):
        """ Randomly samples configuration from the space. """
        return {k: np.random.choice(v) for k, v in config_space.items()}

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

    # Recursive learning example
    model = RecursiveLearner(RandomForestClassifier())
    X_sample = np.random.rand(100, 5)
    y_sample = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=100)
    model.fit(X_sample, y_sample)

    # Self-Optimization Example
    def mock_evaluate(config):
        return np.random.rand()  # Mock evaluation function

    optimizer = SelfOptimizer()
    config_space = {'param1': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], 'param2': [10, 50, 100]}
    best_config = optimizer.optimize(config_space, mock_evaluate)
    print(f"Best Config: {best_config}")
```

### Further Considerations

- **Security and Safety:** Ensure secure and safe operation by implementing sandboxing and fail-safe mechanisms.
- **Scalability:** Design the system to efficiently handle scale variations in data flow and decision-making demands.
- **Compliance and Ethics:** Consider ethical implications and align with legal and regulatory requirements for autonomous systems.

This module provides a broad framework that can be adapted and expanded to meet the specific needs of the PTM empire's autonomy stack.
