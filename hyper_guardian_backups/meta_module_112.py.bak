Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably "Predictive, Telemetry, and Monitoring") empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves several innovative recursive strategies. This module should integrate machine learning, data analysis, and autonomous decision-making to evolve based on new data and changing environments. Here's a conceptual overview of how you could structure such a module:

### Module Overview: `ptm_self_evolve`

This Python module, `ptm_self_evolve`, uses recursive strategies and advanced machine learning techniques to allow the PTM autonomy stack to adapt and evolve over time. The module consists of several key components:

1. **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:** 
   - Automatically ingest data from various sources (e.g., sensors, telemetry data).
   - Clean and preprocess data for analysis, using recursive data cleaning methods to handle anomalies efficiently.

2. **Self-Reflective Learning Algorithm:**
   - Implement recursive learning strategies that continuously adjust based on feedback loops. These can include ensemble methods and reinforcement learning.
   - Use meta-learning to modify learning algorithms themselves, enabling adaptation to new tasks with minimal data.

3. **Recursive Decision-Making:**
   - Utilize recursive algorithms to make decisions in a multi-layered approach, where each layer refines the previous layerâ€™s outputs.
   - Design a neural network architecture capable of self-organization and iterative improvement.

4. **Adaptive Strategy Generation:**
   - Develop a system that generates new strategies by continuously analyzing performance metrics and historical decisions.
   - Incorporate genetic algorithms for recursive optimization of strategy selection.

5. **Distributed Computing Framework:**
   - Implement a distributed architecture to handle large-scale computations efficiently.
   - Use a recursive map-reduce strategy to break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks for parallel execution.

6. **Human-in-the-Loop Systems:**
   - Design interfaces that allow human experts to provide input at various stages, facilitating supervised recursive improvements.

### Example Implementation

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

class RecursiveModel:
    def __init__(self, base_model, recursion_depth=3):
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.recursion_depth = recursion_depth

    def recursive_train(self, X, y):
        for depth in range(self.recursion_depth):
            self.base_model.fit(X, y)
            preds = self.base_model.predict(X)
            error_indices = np.where(preds != y)[0]
            if len(error_indices) > 0:
                X, y = X[error_indices], y[error_indices]
            else:
                break

    def predict(self, X):
        return self.base_model.predict(X)

# Data ingestion (Dummy data for illustration)
X, y = np.random.rand(1000, 10), np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Initialize and train the recursive model
recursive_rf = RecursiveModel(RandomForestClassifier())
recursive_rf.recursive_train(X_train, y_train)

# Making predictions
predictions = recursive_rf.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
```

### Key Features

- **Recursive Training:** Employ recursive training techniques to ensure that the model continuously learns from its mistakes.
  
- **Adaptivity and Scalability:** The module is designed to adapt its learning process based on new data streams and scale efficiently across computational resources.

- **Integration with Existing Systems:** Seamlessly integrate with existing PTM infrastructure to enhance its capabilities without requiring substantial overhaul.

- **Monitoring and Feedback:** Implement robust monitoring tools to gather feedback on performance, feeding into the recursive learning loops for ongoing improvement.

This module represents a blueprint for how the PTM empire can enhance its self-evolving autonomy stack using cutting-edge recursive strategies.
