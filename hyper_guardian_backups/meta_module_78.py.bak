Designing a Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably a fictional or proprietary system) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves creating a system that can adapt and optimize its performance over time. We'll focus on recursive strategies, which involve a process where a function or a system calls itself with modified parameters to solve a problem or improve its state. Here's a high-level design plan, including some Python code snippets for key components:

```python
# PTM Autonomy Module
# This module focuses on self-evolving capabilities using recursive strategies.

from typing import Any, Dict
import random


class PTMAutonomyStack:
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.config = config
        self.state = self.initialize_state()
    
    def initialize_state(self):
        # Initialize the state of the autonomy stack
        return {
            'optimization_level': 0,
            'performance_metrics': {}
        }

    def recursive_optimize(self, depth: int = 0, max_depth: int = 5) -> None:
        """
        Recursively optimize the system based on self-evaluation.
        
        Args:
        - depth: Current depth of the recursive call.
        - max_depth: Maximum depth of recursion allowed.
        """
        if depth > max_depth:
            print(f"Max recursion depth {max_depth} reached. Ending optimization.")
            return

        print(f"Starting optimization at depth {depth}")
        
        # Evaluate current state
        performance = self.evaluate_performance()
        
        # If performance is satisfactory, terminate the recursion
        if self.is_performance_satisfactory(performance):
            print(f"Performance satisfactory at depth {depth}: {performance}")
            return
        
        # Adjust configuration or state for better performance
        self.adjust_configuration(performance)
        
        # Recursively optimize further
        self.recursive_optimize(depth + 1, max_depth)

    def evaluate_performance(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Dummy performance evaluation logic
        print("Evaluating performance...")
        performance = {
            'efficiency': random.uniform(0, 1),
            'accuracy': random.uniform(0, 1)
        }
        self.state['performance_metrics'] = performance
        return performance

    def is_performance_satisfactory(self, performance: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        # Define what satisfactory performance means
        return performance['efficiency'] > 0.8 and performance['accuracy'] > 0.9

    def adjust_configuration(self, performance: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        # Dummy configuration adjustment logic
        print(f"Adjusting configuration based on performance: {performance}")
        if performance['efficiency'] <= 0.8:
            self.state['optimization_level'] += 1
        if performance['accuracy'] <= 0.9:
            self.state['optimization_level'] += 1

    def run(self):
        # Begin the recursive optimization process
        self.recursive_optimize()


# Example usage
config = {
    'optimization_level': 0,
    'max_recursion_depth': 5
}

ptm_autonomy = PTMAutonomyStack(config)
ptm_autonomy.run()
```

### Key Components:

1. **Recursive Strategies**:
   - The `recursive_optimize` method is central, designed to call itself until the system reaches a satisfactory performance level.
   - `max_depth` is considered to prevent infinite recursion and manage computational resources.

2. **Self-Evaluation**:
   - `evaluate_performance` simulates performance assessment using random values. In a real system, this would be replaced with actual performance metrics.

3. **Dynamic Reconfiguration**:
   - `adjust_configuration` method modifies internal parameters to improve performance based on evaluation results.

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - The system maintains performance state within the `self.state['performance_metrics']`.

### Scalability & Flexibility:
- Modular design permits easy updates for performance evaluation or configuration adjustment logic.
- Recursive structure facilitates deeper optimization potential without losing control over resource utilization.

This design provides a skeleton framework that can be expanded with real-world data, additional autonomous features, and more complex performance metrics to enhance the system's self-evolving capabilities.
