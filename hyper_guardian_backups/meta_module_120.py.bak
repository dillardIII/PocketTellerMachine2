Designing a new Python module to enhance the PTM (Presumably Autonomous Tech Module) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack requires a blend of innovative recursive strategies, machine learning techniques, and architectural design. Below is an outline and design for such a module, focusing on recursive strategies for continuous self-improvement.

### Module: `SelfEvolvingAutonomy`

#### Key Components

1. **Recursive Learning Engine**: 
   - Implements a feedback loop for continuous learning and adaptation. Uses recursive strategies to refine models and algorithms over time.

2. **Dynamic Model Updater**: 
   - Automatically updates the autonomy stack's models, incorporating new data and trends without human intervention.

3. **Autonomous Decision Validator**: 
   - Evaluates decisions made by the autonomy stack, validating them against predefined success criteria and using results to improve the decision-making algorithms.

4. **Adaptive Scenario Simulator**: 
   - Simulates various scenarios using current models to test the robustness and adaptability of the autonomy stack.

5. **Self-Diagnosis and Healing System**: 
   - Monitors the health of the autonomy stack, identifies performance bottlenecks, and initiates recovery procedures when anomalies are detected.

#### Core Classes and Methods

```python
# Python module: SelfEvolvingAutonomy

class RecursiveLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self, model):
        """
        Initializes with a base model which will be recursively improved.
        
        Parameters:
        model : any machine learning model recursible enough to implement self-learning
        """
        self.model = model
        
    def train(self, data, labels):
        """Train the model using a recursive improvement strategy."""
        # Implement recursive training routine
        # Example: recursive function call
        self.model.fit(data, labels)
        self._recursive_improvement(data, labels)

    def _recursive_improvement(self, data, labels):
        """Private method for recursive improvement of the model."""
        # Recursive strategy implementation
        # Example recursive logic: self-improvement based on mistakes
        errors = self._calculate_errors(data, labels)
        if errors < some_threshold:
            return
        self.model.update_strategy_based_on(errors)
        self.train(data, labels)

    def _calculate_errors(self, data, labels):
        """Calculate model errors."""
        predictions = self.model.predict(data)
        return self._error_metric(predictions, labels)

class DynamicModelUpdater:
    def update_model(self, new_data):
        """Update the model with new incoming data."""
        # Fetch latest model parameters and update
        # Example logic: Retrain smaller chunks based on new patterns
        
class AutonomousDecisionValidator:
    def validate_decisions(self, decisions, criteria):
        """Validate decisions made by autonomy stack."""
        # Example: Compare decisions with validation criteria
        for decision in decisions:
            result = self._validate(decision, criteria)
            if not result:
                self._improve_decision_making(decision)

    def _improve_decision_making(self, decision):
        """Private method to improve decision-making algorithms."""
        # Implement recursive strategy to refine decision algorithms
        
class AdaptiveScenarioSimulator:
    def simulate(self, scenarios):
        """Simulate scenarios to test model robustness."""
        for scenario in scenarios:
            result = self._run_simulation(scenario)
            self._analyze_simulation(result)

    def _run_simulation(self, scenario):
        """Runs a single scenario simulation."""
        # Simulate current model under scenario conditions
        
class SelfDiagnosisAndHealingSystem:
    def monitor_and_heal(self):
        """Monitor system health and initiate recovery if needed."""
        # Monitor system metrics
        # If detects anomaly, perform healing steps
        anomalies = self._detect_anomalies()
        if anomalies:
            self._execute_healing_procedures(anomalies)

    def _detect_anomalies(self):
        """Detect anomalies in the system."""
        # Implement anomaly detection logic
        
    def _execute_healing_procedures(self, anomalies):
        """Execute self-healing procedures."""
        # Define steps to heal detected anomalies
```

### Recursive Strategies

- **Improvement Loops**: Continuously refine algorithms based on feedback from decision outcomes, errors, and scenario simulations.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Employ feedback from multiple sources (e.g., user feedback, trial runs) to refine models recursively.
- **Self-Healing**: Incorporate techniques that use recursive logic to identify and mitigate faults or degrade gracefully.

### Design Considerations

- **Scalability**: Ensure the module scales with the complexity of tasks and size of data.
- **Modularity**: Use modular design principles to enable seamless integration with existing stack components.
- **Transparency**: Ensure decisions made by recursive models can be interpreted and audited.
- **Robust Testing**: Implement robust unit and integration tests for the entire module to guarantee reliability.

This module architecture embraces recursive learning and adaptability to progressively refine the PTM empire's autonomous systems, ensuring their self-evolution and constant adaptability to changing environments.
