Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves incorporating advanced AI and machine learning techniques. We will focus on implementing recursive strategies that allow the autonomy stack to learn, adapt, and evolve over time. Here's a high-level blueprint and implementation plan for such a module:

### Overview of the Design

1. **Name**: `ptm_self_evolving`
2. **Primary Goal**: Enhance autonomy with self-improving capabilities using recursive strategies.
3. **Key Features**:
   - **Recursive Learning**: A feedback loop that allows the module to recursively refine its models.
   - **Dynamic Adaptation**: Real-time adaptation to new data and environments.
   - **Modular Architecture**: Easily extendable and upgradable components.
   - **Meta-Learning**: The ability to learn the learning process itself.
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics collection to guide evolution.

### Core Components

1. **Data Collector**
    - Gathers and preprocesses data from multiple sources to ensure diverse and comprehensive training inputs.
   
2. **Recursive Strategy Engine**
    - Implements recursive neural networks (RNNs) or recursive autoencoders that allow the module to learn hierarchical patterns.

3. **Model Trainer**
    - Employs recursive training loops that continuously refine the models based on new data.
    - Utilizes transfer learning to adapt existing models to new tasks.

4. **Adaptation Manager**
    - Monitors changes in the environment or task requirements.
    - Adjust the model parameters dynamically to optimize for the current context.

5. **Meta-Learning Component**
    - Uses model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to facilitate rapid adaptation to new tasks.

6. **Performance Evaluator**
    - Continuously assesses model performance using metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and computational efficiency.
    - Provides feedback to the Recursive Strategy Engine for further refinement.

7. **Communication Interface**
    - Facilitates interaction with other modules of the PTM autonomy stack and external systems for enhanced functionality and coordination.

### Sample Code Structure

```python
# ptm_self_evolving/__init__.py

from .data_collector import DataCollector
from .recursive_strategy_engine import RecursiveStrategyEngine
from .model_trainer import ModelTrainer
from .adaptation_manager import AdaptationManager
from .meta_learning import MetaLearner
from .performance_evaluator import PerformanceEvaluator

class PtmSelfEvolving:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_collector = DataCollector()
        self.strategy_engine = RecursiveStrategyEngine()
        self.model_trainer = ModelTrainer()
        self.adaptation_manager = AdaptationManager()
        self.meta_learner = MetaLearner()
        self.performance_evaluator = PerformanceEvaluator()

    def execute(self):
        data = self.data_collector.collect()
        model = self.strategy_engine.build_model()
        while True:
            refined_model = self.model_trainer.train(model, data)
            self.adaptation_manager.adapt(refined_model)
            self.meta_learner.meta_learn(refined_model)
            performance = self.performance_evaluator.evaluate(refined_model)
            if self._should_terminate(performance):
                break
    
    def _should_terminate(self, performance):
        # Termination logic based on performance metrics
        return performance['accuracy'] > 0.98 or performance['stability'] < 0.01

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ptm_autonomy_system = PtmSelfEvolving()
    ptm_autonomy_system.execute()
```

### Innovations

- **Recursive Pattern Recognition**: Utilizing recursive strategies to recognize and adapt to complex patterns over time.
- **Adaptation Triggers**: Real-time triggers for adaptation based on environmental inputs and performance feedback.
- **Evolving Architectures**: Employing neural architecture search (NAS) for evolving model structures.

This module can significantly enhance the PTM empire's autonomy stack by enabling self-improvement and adaptation to unforeseen scenarios, making it resilient and robust in handling complex real-world tasks.
