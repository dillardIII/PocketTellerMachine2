Creating an advanced Python module for an empire like the "PTM empire" requires careful planning, especially if it involves recursion, intelligence, and scalability. Below is an example of such a module, demonstrating intelligent recursion for a hypothetical scenario: let's say PTM stands for "Prime Task Manager." This tool could manage tasks recursively, learn from patterns, optimize itself over time, and prioritize tasks based on complexity and dependencies:

```python
# ptm_module.py

class Task:
    def __init__(self, name, complexity, dependencies=None):
        self.name = name
        self.complexity = complexity
        self.dependencies = dependencies if dependencies else []

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Task(name={self.name}, complexity={self.complexity}, dependencies={self.dependencies})"


class PTM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []

    def add_task(self, task: Task):
        self.tasks.append(task)

    def _resolve_dependencies(self, task):
        unresolved = set(task.dependencies)
        resolved = set()
        resolution_path = []

        def resolve(task_name):
            if task_name in resolved:
                return
            if task_name in unresolved:
                unresolved.remove(task_name)

            for t in self.tasks:
                if t.name == task_name:
                    for dep in t.dependencies:
                        if dep not in resolved:
                            resolve(dep)
                    resolution_path.append(task_name)
                    resolved.add(task_name)

        resolve(task.name)
        return resolution_path

    def schedule_tasks(self):
        schedule = []
        resolved_tasks = set()

        for task in sorted(self.tasks, key=lambda x: x.complexity, reverse=True):
            if task.name not in resolved_tasks:
                dependencies_resolved = self._resolve_dependencies(task)
                schedule.extend(dependencies_resolved)
                resolved_tasks.update(dependencies_resolved)

        # Intelligent approach: prioritize tasks based on complexity and resolved dependencies.
        return schedule

    def process_tasks(self, task_list=None):
        completed_tasks = []
        if task_list is None:
            task_list = self.schedule_tasks()

        for task in task_list:
            print(f"Processing {task}...")
            # Fictitious learning: Simulate task completion and adjust future priorities.
            completed_tasks.append(task)
            # Here, we could add machine learning models to learn task patterns.

        return completed_tasks


# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ptm = PTM()
    ptm.add_task(Task("Develop", 5, dependencies=["Design"]))
    ptm.add_task(Task("Design", 3, dependencies=["Research"]))
    ptm.add_task(Task("Research", 2))
    ptm.add_task(Task("Deploy", 6, dependencies=["Develop", "Test"]))
    ptm.add_task(Task("Test", 4, dependencies=["Develop"]))

    schedule = ptm.schedule_tasks()
    print("Task Schedule:", schedule)

    completed = ptm.process_tasks()
    print("Completed Tasks:", completed)
```

### Explanation

1. **Task Class**: Represents a task with a name, complexity, and optional dependencies.

2. **PTM Class**: Manages the tasks, resolves dependencies intelligently, and processes tasks based on complexity.

3. **_resolve_dependencies Method**: Uses recursion to figure out the order of task dependencies.

4. **schedule_tasks Method**: Orders tasks based on complexity and resolved dependencies for efficient processing.

5. **Intelligent Processing**: Though the current implementation uses a static logic, a learning model could be integrated to further optimize the process based on past performance, user input, or system constraints.

6. **Adaptive Recursion**: The recursive nature of dependency resolution allows the system to dynamically adapt to changing tasks and dependencies.

This module is a foundation and could be expanded by integrating machine learning frameworks to enhance task scheduling and completion predictions, adding parallel processing capabilities, and logging for further analysis.
