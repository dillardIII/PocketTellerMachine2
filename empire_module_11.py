Creating an "intelligent recursion" module requires us first to define what that might mean in this context. Intelligent recursion could imply several things, such as optimizing recursive calls through memoization, dynamic programming, or introducing heuristic-based decision-making to make recursion more efficient.

Below is a Python module that demonstrates sophisticated recursion through memoization and adaptive strategies using Python's decorators and some heuristic techniques.

### Description:

- **Memoized Fibonacci:** It uses Python's built-in `lru_cache` to efficiently cache already-computed Fibonacci numbers.

- **Adaptive Factorial:** It chooses between recursive and iterative factorial calculations based on the size of `n`. A threshold is set to decide which method is optimal.

- **Probabilistic Traversal:** Demonstrates an heuristic-based approach to explore complex structures like graphs with probabilistic decisions. Here, it simulates a generic traversal, assuming a structure with tuples mimicking graph nodes and edges, using depth-first style heuristics with randomness to avoid determinism.

This module highlights the application of intelligent techniques to recursion and various strategies that can be adapted further for more intricate structures or decision-making processes.
