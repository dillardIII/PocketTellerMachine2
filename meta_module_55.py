Designing a new Python module to expand the PTM (Presumably short for "Prompted Text Model" or similar) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack can involve several key components that focus on recursion, self-improvement, and adaptation. Below is a conceptual overview of how you might structure such a module, featuring recursive strategies for growth and self-optimization.

### Module Overview: `ptm_autonomy`

1. **Purpose and Goals**:
   - To enable self-evolving capabilities within the PTM framework.
   - To implement recursive strategies that allow models to identify and improve their weaknesses.
   - To facilitate dynamic adaptation in response to new data and environments.

2. **Key Components**:

#### 1. Recursive Self-Optimization

- **Component Name**: `RecursiveOptimizer`
- **Description**: Implements strategies for recursive self-optimization. Utilizes feedback loops to continuously refine model parameters.
- **Core Strategies**:
  - **Gradient analysis**: Automatic identification of model weaknesses through gradient inspection.
  - **Hyperparameter tuning**: Recursive adjustment of hyperparameters using techniques like Bayesian optimization or genetic algorithms.

```python
class RecursiveOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
    
    def optimize(self, data):
        # Identify weaknesses
        gradients = self._analyze_gradients(data)
        
        # Impose changes recursively
        self._recursive_tuning(gradients)

    def _analyze_gradients(self, data):
        # Perform gradient analysis to find areas of improvement
        pass

    def _recursive_tuning(self, gradients):
        # Adjust model parameters and re-evaluate
        pass
```

#### 2. Dynamic Adaptation Layer

- **Component Name**: `AdaptationEngine`
- **Description**: Adapts models to new data and environments using recursive learning techniques.
- **Core Strategies**:
  - **Data-driven adaptation**: Continuous learning by leveraging real-time data inputs.
  - **Environment simulation**: Recursive simulations of various scenarios to enhance model adaptability.

```python
class AdaptationEngine:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        
    def adapt(self, new_data):
        # Acquire data insights
        data_insights = self._recursive_analysis(new_data)

        # Adapt based on insights
        self._apply_adaptation(data_insights)

    def _recursive_analysis(self, new_data):
        # Analyze incoming data recursively
        pass

    def _apply_adaptation(self, data_insights):
        # Apply necessary adaptations to the model
        pass
```

#### 3. Recursive Learning Mechanisms

- **Component Name**: `SelfImprovingLearner`
- **Description**: Implements recursive learning mechanisms for continuous self-improvement.
- **Core Strategies**:
  - **Self-reflection**: Models assess their own performance and identify learning opportunities.
  - **Collaborative learning**: Recursive interaction with other models to share knowledge and strategies.

```python
class SelfImprovingLearner:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        
    def learn(self):
        # Perform self-reflection
        self._recursive_self_assessment()

        # Collaborate with other models
        self._collaborative_update()

    def _recursive_self_assessment(self):
        # Allow the model to reflect on its performance
        pass
    
    def _collaborative_update(self):
        # Interact with peer models for collaborative learning
        pass
```

3. **Integration and Usage**:
   - To integrate these components, set up an orchestration layer that manages when and how each component activates based on the PTM's goals and the context of operation.
   - Provide interfaces for easy integration into existing PTM structures, enabling autonomous self-evolution across various applications.

```python
class PTMAutonomy:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.recursive_optimizer = RecursiveOptimizer(model)
        self.adaptation_engine = AdaptationEngine(model)
        self.self_improving_learner = SelfImprovingLearner(model)
        
    def evolve(self, data, new_data):
        self.recursive_optimizer.optimize(data)
        self.adaptation_engine.adapt(new_data)
        self.self_improving_learner.learn()
```

This module provides a framework for integrating recursive, self-evolving strategies into the PTM empire, using state-of-the-art concepts from artificial intelligence and machine learning.
