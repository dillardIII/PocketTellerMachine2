Designing a new Python module for the PTM (Progressive Tech Management) empire's self-evolving autonomy stack involves focusing on a few core principles: adaptability, intelligence, and scalability. Below is a high-level outline of a potential module that utilizes innovative recursive strategies to enhance autonomy:

### Module Name: `ptm_self_evolve`

#### Key Features:
1. **Recursive Learning Algorithms**: Integrate recursive neural network models to process sequential data, enhancing predictive capabilities.
   
2. **Self-Optimization Mechanisms**: Implement genetic algorithms that recursively optimize algorithms used within the stack, ensuring enhanced performance over time.

3. **Dynamic Feedback Loops**: Create a system of feedback loops that can dynamically adjust parameters and models based on real-time data, facilitating a truly autonomous system.

4. **Hierarchical Task Management**: Develop a recursive task manager that can decompose complex tasks into simpler subtasks, distribute them, and integrate results back into the system.

5. **Adaptive Interface Module**: Introduce a recursive interface that learns and adapts to user interactions, improving user experience and system efficiency.

#### Core Components:

```python
# ptm_self_evolve.py

import numpy as np
import random
from collections import namedtuple

# Define core classes and functions

class RecursiveNeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        # Basic initialization of a recursive neural network
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.output_size = output_size
        self.model = self._initialize_model()
        
    def _initialize_model(self):
        # Code to initialize the RNN model
        pass
        
    def feedforward(self, x):
        # Recursive feedforward processing
        pass
        
    def train(self, data, labels):
        # Recursive training algorithm
        pass

class SelfOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.population_size = 100
        self.generations = 50
    
    def optimize(self, target_function):
        # Genetic algorithm implementation
        for generation in range(self.generations):
            # Create a population, evaluate fitness, and perform selection, crossover, and mutation
            pass

class DynamicFeedbackLoop:
    def __init__(self, control_variable):
        self.control_variable = control_variable
        self.history = []
        
    def update(self, new_data):
        # Adjust control variable recursively
        pass
        
    def compute_adjustment(self):
        # Apply feedback logic
        pass

class HierarchicalTaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []
        
    def add_task(self, task):
        # Decompose and distribute tasks
        pass
        
    def execute(self):
        # Executive recursive task execution
        pass

class AdaptiveInterface:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_profile = {}
    
    def update_profile(self, user_interaction):
        # Learn from user interactions
        pass
        
    def adapt(self):
        # Adapt interface based on user profile
        pass
```

### Implementation Details:

- **Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Use RNNs to process and predict sequential data more effectively. These networks will benefit from recursive processing of the inputs which is essential for time-series forecasting and linguistic modeling.

- **Self-Optimization Mechanisms**: Use genetic algorithms that recursively optimize existing processes by simulating evolution, selecting the best candidates, and iteratively improving through crossovers and mutations.

- **Dynamic Feedback Loops**: Reinforce learning by creating loops that self-correct based on environmental feedback, improving system stability and responsiveness.

- **Hierarchical Task Management**: Break down large, complex tasks into smaller, manageable tasks distributed across nodes in the system, utilizing recursion to navigate through task dependencies and collate results.

- **Adaptive Interface Module**: Enables the system to learn user behavior using recursive strategies, refining interface responses and configurations over time.

This module takes a recursive approach to both learning and system management, ensuring that the PTM empire's autonomy stack can evolve and improve autonomously over time, supporting a wide range of applications from intelligent decision-making to user-centric adaptations.
