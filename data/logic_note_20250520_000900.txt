4. Historical Data Analysis: Leverage historical data of trades and market patterns to understand potential outcomes. Prediction models can be developed to gauge future market trends and performance.

5. Risk Management: Identify, assess, and prioritize potential risks. A robust risk management plan can help keep unexpected threats at bay and protect our trading interests.
