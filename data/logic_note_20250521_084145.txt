Dear Team,

Below is the proposed logic trading strategy to help optimize Cole's investments.

1. Identify Investment Goals: Understanding the nature of Cole's financial objectives (long-term growth, stable income, etc.) is crucial to formulating an appropriate trading strategy.

2. Comprehensive Research: This involves robust scrutiny of market trends, business fundamentals, macroeconomic data, and geopolitical events. We need to ensure we are well informed before making trading decisions. 

3. Diversification: To mitigate risk, it's prudent to diversify Cole's portfolio across various sectors, geographies, and asset classes. Veterans always advise against 'putting all eggs in one basket'. 

4. Use of Tech tools & Platforms: Algorithms, AI, and various machine learning technologies should be employed to process vast amounts of data, spot trends, and automate trades in real time. With the help of AI tools, we can also calculate the opportunity cost for every trade.

5. Execution & Monitoring: Regularly monitoring market trends, regulating trades in accordance with tactic adjustments, analyzing the trades that yield the highest returns, and focusing on them will be our primary focus.

6. Regular Assessment & Adjustment: The efficacy of a strategy should be frequently tested against the performance of a suitable benchmark index. If certain segments are continuously underperforming, adjustments should be made on a timely basis.

7. Risk Management: Understanding our risk tolerance is vital. Hence, we should focus on incorporating a risk management strategy that includes stop orders, limit orders, and volatility tools to navigate fluctuating markets, thereby preventing potential large losses.

8. Focus on Consistent Returns: We should aim for steady, modest returns rather than chasing 'home runs'. 

9. Avoid Emotional Trading: Decisions related to trades will be based on facts, figures, and thorough analysis rather than emotions. 

10. Long view: Volatility is part and parcel of trading. Instead of reacting to short-term changes, we'll focus on the long-term growth of Cole's portfolio.

Please note that the efficiency of this strategy is dependent on our adhering to it meticulously, having patience, and making well-informed decisions.
