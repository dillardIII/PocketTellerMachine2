Subject: Logic Strategy Note

Dear Cole,

As we navigate the often unpredictable world of trading, it is important to have a solid, logical strategy in place. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Risk Management:** This is the cornerstone of any trading strategy. Determine the amount of capital you are willing to risk on each trade. A common rule is not to risk more than 1-2% of your account on a single trade. 

2. **Market Analysis:** Use both technical and fundamental analysis to make informed decisions. Technical analysis involves studying price patterns and trends, while fundamental analysis involves looking at a company's financials and market position. 

3. **Diversification:** Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes and sectors to spread risk.

4. **Discipline:** Stick to your trading plan and avoid making decisions based on emotions. Trading is a long-term game and patience is key.

5. **Continuous Learning:** The market is constantly changing, and so should your strategies. Keep learning and adapting to stay ahead.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your trades to identify what's working and what's not. Use this information to adjust your strategy as needed.

Remember, the goal is not to win every trade, but to come out ahead over the long run. Stay focused, stay disciplined, and stay logical.

Best Regards,
