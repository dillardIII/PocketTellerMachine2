Subject: Logic Strategy for Effective Trading

Dear Cole,

As your trading assistant, I have devised a set of logical strategies that we can employ while trading. Here's a brief summary:

1. ***Risk Management***: A logical trading strategy starts by managing risk. This includes setting a budget for each trade, which we will not surpass no matter what. It can be determined as a percentage of our total revenue, the capital invested, or amount we are liable to lose.

2. ***Market Analysis***: No trade should be made without prior, rigorous research. There's a need for technical tactics like chart and trend analysis, as well as fundamental tactics like analyzing economics, financials, and market news. 

3. ***Trading Plan***: A logical strategy always includes a premeditated trading plan. Every movement in the market, whether we're buying or selling, has to be part of this plan. Proactively, we establish our entry and exit points, and not be swayed by characteristics of the market like under/overvaluation. 

4. ***Emotion Control***: We cannot let emotions guide our trading decisions. Unsuccessful trades are part of the process and reaction to them, whether it be panic selling or euphoric buying, usually leads to poor decisions. It's logical to stick to the strategy even when things aren't going our way.

5. ***Regular Reviews***: Every trade must be followed by a review, where we assess the success and adjust our strategy accordingly. It includes a thorough analysis of both wins and losses. An essential part of improving our trading strategy is learning from our past trades.

6. ***Diversification***: To safeguard our portfolio from potential harm, it's wise to diversify across different assets and markets. 

7. ***Continuous Learning***: As markets evolve, so should our strategies. It's of the utmost importance that we continuously learn from reputable sources, stay updated with new technological advances, and improve our knowledge.

Please, let me know if you would like to discuss any point further. Your thoughts and feedback are always appreciated.

Best,
