Title: Trading Logic Strategy Note

1. Objective Analysis: Each trading action should begin with a comprehensive and objective analysis. The success of a trade greatly depends on understanding market trends, financial indicators, historical data, and the overall global economic climate. Disregard personal bias and focus on empirical evidence to base decisions. 

2. Diversification: As the old saying goes, 'Don't put all your eggs in one basket'. Diversify the investment portfolio across different asset classes in order to minimize risk. Identify sectors and industries that show promise and potential growth. 

3. Risk Management: Establish strict rules about the acceptable level of risk for each trade and investment overall. Use stop-loss orders and take-profit levels to protect profits and prevent loss. 

4. Keep Up with Macro-Economic events: Always be aware of economic events around the globe. Economies are interlinked, and the fallout from one region could adversely affect markets in another. 

5. Consistency: Stick to your defined trading plan, and avoid impulsive decisions induced by market speculations. Consistency and patience are two vitally important virtues in successful trading. 

6. Regular Reviews: Regularly review investment strategies and market trend analysis. Markets are dynamic, and respecting that dynamics aids in staying proactive and prepared for any sudden shifts. 

7. Skill Acquisition: Regularly update your knowledge about market trends, analytical tools, and investment strategies. Attend webinars, read established market analysis, and continuously build on your industry knowledge.

8. Automate and Technology-Assisted Trade: Utilize automation and modern technological assistance for a more improved and error-free trading. This does not only help in saving time but also eliminates a significant amount of human error.

9. Emotion Control: One of the key roots of trading mistakes is emotional decision making. Fear and greed can significantly impact judgment, thus logic-based decision making ought to be prioritized over emotional impulse.

Remember, trading is a game of probability - none of these strategies guarantee success but they can dramatically increase the odds of profit. Trading involves patience, disciplined strategy implementation and a constant hunger for learning.
