1. Comprehensive Market Analysis:
Stay updated with the global and sector-specific market trends, economic indicators, political situation, and Central Bank decisions. Let's focus more on fundamentals than mere speculations.

2. Diversification:
Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread the investments across various asset classes and sectors in alignment with the risk appetite and financial goals.

3. Disciplined Trading:
Implement stop-loss and booking profit orders to maintain discipline and avoid emotional trading decisions. It will help in effective risk management and capital preservation.

4. Risk Management: 
Ensure to invest only the surplus funds and keep a strict check on the exposure levels in risky and volatile markets. Remember, the goal is to make consistent profits and not just one-time gains.

These are general strategies and may need to be tweaked as per specific requirements.
