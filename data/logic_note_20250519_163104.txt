Subject: Comprehending and Implementing a Trading Logic Strategy

Dear Team,

With the goal of optimizing our performance and rising above market developments, it's essential to establish a trading logic strategy. This plan aids in guiding investment decisions and ensuring profitable returns on our trades. 

Strategy Overview:

1. Market Analysis: Understanding market trends, market cycles, and financial news is crucial. Economic indicators, political events, company earnings, and major events all have an impact on market dynamics. 

2. Technical Analysis: It involves examining historical data (price, volume) to predict future price movements. It provides key insights into potential trading opportunities.

3. Risk Management: Assume that every trade carries a certain level of risk. Define beforehand the percentage of your capital that you are ready to risk on each operation (usually between 1-2%).

4. Entry and Exit Strategies: Set explicit rules for entering and exiting trades. This could be the reach of certain price levels, execution of particular technical analysis patterns, or upcoming economic events.

5. Reevaluate the Strategy: Constant reevaluation of the strategy is necessary. If the plan is underperforming or market conditions change substantially, the strategy should be adjusted or rectified.

6. Emotional Control: Making decisions based on fear or greed can be detrimental. Stick to the logic-based strategy set in place - regardless of market conditions.

7. Diversification: To decrease risk exposure, it's suggested to diversify your investments across various asset classes, geographic regions, and sectors. 

8. Continuous Learning: Markets evolve continuously, so one needs to consistently improve their trading skills and knowledge. Attending webinars, reading news, and following expert advice could refine your informed decisions.

In conclusion, constructing a logical trading strategy will aid us in staying focused and disciplined in our trading operations. Itâ€™s crucial that we all comprehend the strategy and implement it efficiently to optimize our trading performance.

Let's make the best of this opportunity and harness the power of logical strategy to excel in our trading endeavors.
