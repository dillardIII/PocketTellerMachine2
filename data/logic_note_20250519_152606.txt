Subject: Logic Strategy for Efficient Trading

Dear Team,

In the dynamic world of trading, crafting an effective and logic-based strategy is paramount. The primary objective of our trading strategy revolves around mitigating risk and maximizing returns. Here’s a template of our logic strategy that we ought to follow:

1. **Information Analysis:** Always perform deep and thorough research on the market before making any decision. This involves the collection and interpretation of market data, evaluating global trends, economic indicators and company reports. Be analytical and proactive in gathering information. 

2. **Defined Goals:** Set well-defined trading goals. Whether it’s about generating consistent income or capital appreciation, know what we want to achieve.

3. **Risk Management Plan:** Never enter any trade without a solid risk management plan. Our rule of thumb is not risking more than a certain percentage of our capital on a single trade. Always use stop loss.

4. **Trend is our Friend:** When developing trading patterns, remember ‘the trend is our friend’. It is often easier and more profitable to go with the trend rather than against it. 

5. **Diversify Investment:** Don't put all our eggs in one basket. Spreading the investments across different sectors helps in lowering risk and increasing the potential for returns.

6. **Emotion Control:** Trading decisions should never be emotional. It's easy to get swept up in the moment and make impulsive decisions due to fear or greed. Stick to the strategy and ignore the noise.

7. **Regular Monitoring and Evaluation:** No strategy is perfect, and market dynamics quickly change. Monitor performance regularly and modify strategies timely. Learn from mistakes or losses and continually try to refine our strategy.

8. **Long-term Perspective:** Maintain a long-term perspective. Trading is not about making a fortune overnight. Be patient, stay disciplined, and play the long game for sustained success.

Remember, the goal should always be consistency over grandeur and discipline over recklessness. The best trading strategy is one that aligns with our goals, suits our trading personality, and is rooted in rationality, stable rules, and intelligent decision-making. 

Let us move forward with these logical strategic principles towards achieving our trading objectives.
