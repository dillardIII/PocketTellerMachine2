Subject: New Trading Strategy Market Evolution

Dear Cole,

After evaluating current market trends, this note circulates to propose an effective trading strategy to optimize our portfolio performance and minimize risk. Here is a logic strategy focusing on both quantitative and qualitative facets:

I. Fundamental Analysis:
This includes a thorough examination of the financial health of companies we consider investing in. We'll look at earnings reports, federal reserve releases, and global economic news that might impact our potential investments. 

II. Diversification:
We'll spread our investments across a wide range of assets. This approach would reduce our exposure to risk and minimize potential losses. This includes an eclectic mix of geographies, sectors, and different-sized companies.

III. Stop-Loss Orders:
We'll employ stop-loss orders on all our trades to contain losses. This strategy will automatically trigger a sell order if the stock falls below a certain predetermined level. It will help to limit potential losses automatically.

IV. Using Trading Indicators:
We'll use technical indicators like moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and Bollinger bands to predict future price movements. Whilst these may not always give correct predictions, they will certainly come close, more often than not. 

V. Risk Management:
As part of this strategy, we'll set a maximum percentage risk limit per trade. This combined with the practice of setting stop-loss orders will ensure that in the event of a loss, it will be manageable and will not significantly impact our portfolio. 

VI. Patience and Disciplinarism:
Lastly, we need to have the patience to wait for the right market conditions to enter or exit a trade. We must avoid making impulsive decisions based on temporary market fluctuations. Consistently following the strategy is also essential. 

This strategy could act as a buffer against potential market downturns whilst still aiming for reasonable returns. However, all trades carry some risk, and we must always keep an eye on market changes and adapt accordingly. Looking forward to discussing these proposed strategies with you soon.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
