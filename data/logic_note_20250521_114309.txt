Subject: Comprehensive Trading Strategy Approach

Dear Cole,

In pursuing our trading objectives, it is essential to adhere to certain market principles and methodologies. Following is our refined trading strategy, composed with meticulous analysis and proven tactics:

1. **Risk Management:** Never risk more than 1-2% of total trading capital on a single trade. This strategy will save us from colossal losses that may hinder our investment growth in the long run.

2. **Trend Following:** Always trade in the direction of the trend. Being trend-followers exposes us to large market moves, increasing profitability, and decreasing risk.

3. **Regular Research and Continuous Learning:** There are constant advancements in global markets, new regulations, and fluctuating global economies. Stay informed, and let us continually educate ourselves to change and adapt our strategy as per market demands.

4. **Fundamental & Technical Analysis:** Regularly perform both types of analyses. Fundamental analysis will help us understand the overall market direction and potential company growth, while technical analysis will assist in making informed decisions based upon historical price movements and different market phases.

5. **Diversification:** Mitigate risk by spreading investments across various financial instruments, sectors, and regions. This will cushion our portfolio against market volatility.

6. **Patience:** Patience is crucial in trading. Waiting for the right time to enter and exit a trade often leads to profitable opportunities.

7. **Emotional Control:** Trading emotions like fear and greed can lead to hasty decisions, which often result in loss. Stick to our plan, manage trades objectively, and avoid impulsive reactions to market fluctuations.

8. **Performance Monitoring:** Regular review of our open and closed trades will help us to understand our strong points and areas needing improvement. This feedback loop is key to our constant growth as traders.

9. **Periodic Rebalancing:** Ensure our portfolio aligns with our predetermined risk tolerance levels. Dedicate a specific time for rebalancing i.e., buying more of lesser performing assets, and selling shares of better-performing assets.

10. **Utilizing Stop Loss and Take Profit Points:** Consider the usage of stop-losses and pre-determined profit targets that will automatically close trades, safeguarding us from extreme market movements.

Lastly, always remember that there are no guaranteed profits in trading; it's all about playing probabilities and managing risks. Let's adopt this strategy as a working plan, a tool to achieve our trading goals.
