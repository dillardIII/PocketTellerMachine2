Title: Comprehensive Trading Strategy 

Date: [Current Date]

Dear Cole,

The primary aim of our trading strategy is to maximize return on investment by intelligently managing risks. I plan on implementing the following measures:
 
1. Diversification: To spread the investment risk, we will diversify between industries and geographic locations. This way, if one investment fails, others can offset the loss.

2. Value Investing: We will focus on companies that are underpriced through rigorous fundamental analysis. Our goal is to find companies that are undervalued and have strong long-term prospects.

3. Momentum Trading: We'll follow the trend of successful stocks and identify potential breakout occasions.

4. Dollar Cost Averaging: This strategy involves buying a fixed dollar amount of a particular investment on a regular schedule, irrespective of the stock price. Over time, this strategy results in purchasing more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high. Hence, reducing the impact of volatility on large purchases of financial assets.

5. Risk Management: In all circumstances, we will not invest more than 2% of our total capital in any single trade. Also, we should not have more than 10% risk exposure at any particular point in time.

6. Consistent Monitoring: We will continuously track both micro and macroeconomic indicators, setting alerts for major market changes and adjusting our portfolio as necessary.

7. Patience and Discipline: Patience is vital; panicking or rash decisions could make for poor investments. We stay disciplined and stick to our plan at all times.

The aforementioned points summarize our trading strategy to ensure a balanced and risk-averse portfolio. Regular revision of the strategy is essential based on market dynamics.

Please review and let's discuss any changes or suggestions you may have.

Best Regards,

[Your name]
