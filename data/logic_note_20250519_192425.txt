Subject: Logic Strategy Note

We are at the helm of market volatility, however, the main logic strategy for planning our trades would revolve around the following pillars:

1. **Market Research**: Continue to conduct the fundamental and technical analysis to assess the current market situation. Let's delve deep into economic indicators, news events, statistical reports, and other economic markers that can influence trade.

2. **Diversification**: Considering the uncertainties in the market, diversification can act as a safety net against potential risks. Let's keep a balanced portfolio that includes a variety of asset classes.

3. **Risk Management**: Trade risk is inherently tied to potential benefit. Recognize what level of risk is acceptable for us, predicting potential losses.

4. **Plan Set Up**: Establish a clearly defined plan for every trade, assessing the Entry, Stop, and Profit Targets. Let historical data, economical news, and your market forecast guide the plan.

5. **Trend Following**: Letâ€™s implement the trend-following strategy that seeks to capture gains by analyzing the momentum of a particular asset's price in a particular direction.

6. **Review and Optimization**: Our strategies need constant revamping based on market conditions. Regular reviews ensure that our current approach is the most effective for the ever-changing trading landscape.

7. **Keeping Emotions in Check**: Maintain logical reasoning in all trading decisions, avoiding impulsive actions based on temporary market spikes or plunges.

8. **Stop Loss and Take Profit**: Implement stop loss and take profit points to curtail losses and lock in gains when the trade is in our favour respectively.

This plan will position us to logically and systematically navigate the market, minimizing risk, and maximizing opportunities for gains. Our actions will be responsive to changing market conditions and we will stay proactive, rather than reactive.
