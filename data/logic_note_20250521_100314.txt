Subject: Logic Strategy Development for Successful Trading 

Dear Team,

The success of trading depends significantly on the establishment of a robust and logical trading strategy that considers various external factors influencing the stock market trends. Developing this strategy is a continuous process, requiring constant scrutiny, testing, and refinement along the way.

The below proposed trading strategies incorporate logical reasoning:

1. **Risk Management**: This strategy becomes the cornerstone of our endeavor. Always calculate the potential risk before estimating probable profits. Control risk by setting stop orders. We need to limit our risk to 1-2% of our total trading account per deal.

2. **Market Trend Analysis**: Adopt a logical approach to identify strong trends in the market. It helps to maximize returns by investing in strong upward trend stocks and minimizing investment in downward-moving stocks.

3. **Discipline and Patience**: Exiting a trade too early or too late because of fear or greed can impact overall trading performance. Stick to the plan, limit decisions based on emotions.

4. **Diversification**: Distribute the investments over varied asset classes to distribute the risk. It's also essential to diversify within the same asset type. Buy stocks from different industries to shield from sector-specific risks.

5. **Continuous Learning**: It's essential to keep updated with market changes, new developments, and economical news. 

6. **Leverage Technology**: Implement advanced trading tools for in-depth analysis, machine learning algorithms for predicting trends, and automated trading bots for executing trades.

7. **Keep the Strategy Simple**: A complex strategy may create confusion and provoke making errors. A simple, direct, and logical strategy is sustainable in the long-term. 

Remember that even the best strategies won't guarantee success every time. Markets may behave unexpectedly due to various reasons beyond control. Hence it is advisable to keep fine-tuning the strategies based on the learning from every trade.

Stay focused and trade logically, not emotionally.
