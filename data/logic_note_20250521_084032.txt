Subject: Logic Trading Strategy Update

Dear Team,

It's time for a review and update of our current trading processes. Our core focus remains on maximizing profitability whilst mitigating risk. In such, it is essential for us to instill a logical approach into our trading systems. 

Here's a strategic note on our updated trading logic:

1. **Systematic Research**: We can't stress enough the importance of a well-informed trade. Always base your trades on comprehensive market research, focusing on market trends, investor sentiment, economic factors, and company performance. Through systematic due diligence, we can make assertive and logical trading decisions. 

2. **Risk Management**: Our strategy must always prioritize risk mitigation. A simple yet effective technique is the '1% risk rule', where no single trade risks more than 1% of our portfolio. Following this logic helps prevent devastating losses and allow for longevity in trading.

3. **Diversification**: Diversification is key. It would be best if we never put all our eggs in one basket. A diverse portfolio spread across different asset classes, sectors, or regions helps reduce risk and increase potential returns.

4. **Methodical Profit-Taking**: Implement a strategy for taking profits. One could be the rule of thumb of selling half the position when an asset increases by a certain percentage. This logical approach will lock-in profits and avoid potential price reversals.

5. **Emotion-free Trading**: Emotional trading decisions can lead to substantial trading mistakes. Developing a robust trading plan and adhering to it assiduously helps us stay logical and counter unprofitable emotional responses.

6. **Regular Review**: Let's constantly review and refine our trading strategies to accommodate market changes and maximize profitability. A trade plan is not set in stone; it should evolve with you and the market.

By staying disciplined and thoughtful in our approach, we can navigate even the biggest market volatility with a logical strategy in place. This transformation won't happen overnight. It requires time, consistency, and implementation. Let's work hard to ingrain these principles into our daily operations.

Best,
