Subject: Logic Strategy Note 

Dear Team,

In an attempt to ensure that we optimize our trading activities, the following logical trading strategy should be adhered to:

1. **Risk Management**: This remains integral to our trading strategy. All trades must ensure that potential losses do not exceed a pre-determined percentage of our trading capital, say 1-2%. This rule serves as protection from potential downswings.

2. **Market Research**: In-depth and comprehensive market research should be the basis of our trading activities. Understanding the market and economic indicators will enable more successful predictions about future trends.

3. **Trend Identification**: Following market trends is key to successful trading. Upward or downward trends can indicate viable trading opportunities. We should make it a strategically logical step to identify these trends on a consistent basis.

4. **Diverse Portfolios**: Diversifying our portfolios ensures we reduce risks and access multiple market growth areas. A logical diversification strategy involves investing in different assets, different sectors, and sometimes, different markets.

5. **Patience and Discipline**: These are imperative in trading activities. Trades should not be rushed; sufficient data should be collected before making decisions. Missteps often occur as a result of hasty trading actions.

6. **Technical Analysis**: Our trading strategy needs to incorporate technical analysis. Identifying chart patterns, using technical indicators, and understanding statistical trends are core components of technical analysis. 

7. **Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Orders**: It is logical to always set stop-loss and take-profit points when placing trades. This automates the trading process and ensures certain profitability levels are maintained.

8. **Consistent Strategy Evaluation**: Regular reviews and updates of our trading strategies are necessary. What worked yesterday may not work today. Continuous evaluation allows us to stay relevant and adapt to market changes.

Each stakeholder is expected to adopt these outlined strategies. Our primary goal is to foster sustainable growth, mitigate risks, and build increased profitability in our trading activities.

Best,
