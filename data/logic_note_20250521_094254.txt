Thoroughly analyze and understand the nature of the markets in which we operate, being aware of market influences such as global events, political shifts, economic indicators, and market sentiment.

2. Risk Management:
Establish a robust risk management framework to protect from significant losses. This should include setting stop-loss levels and regularly reviewing trading results.

3. Use of Technology:
Leverage hi-tech tools such as AI for technical analysis and trade predictions. Incorporate automated trading systems to manage multiple accounts or to execute large orders simultaneously.
