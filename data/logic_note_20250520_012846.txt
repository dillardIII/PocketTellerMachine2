Subject: Strategic Trading Approach 

After careful market analysis and studying current trends, this note outlines our recommended trading strategy going forward. 

1. Diversify Portfolio: Aim to mitigate risks through diversification. Spread investments across various financial instruments, sectors, and geographies to reduce the potential for a significant loss. 

2. Market Research: Focus on regular in-depth market research, reviewing economic indicators, sector trends, and political climates. Stay informed about global events that affect financial markets.

3. Risk Management: Maintain a disciplined risk management strategy. Never risk more than a pre-determined percentage on one trade and use stop losses to limit potential losses. 

4. Evaluate Performance Regularly: Conduct a thorough analysis of our trading performance on a monthly and quarterly basis, tracking both our wins and losses. Modify our strategy based on these evaluations when necessary.

5. Patient Investment: Short-term market fluctuations should not divert us from our long-term investment strategy. Buying and holding quality stocks offers the potential for profitable returns over time.

6. Stay Flexible: While it's important to adhere to our trading strategy, flexibility is needed as market conditions could change unexpectedly.

7. Adopt Contrarian Approach: There could be opportunities when we should adopt the contrarian approach i.e., buy or sell when the majority in the market are doing the opposite. However, thorough research is recommended beforehand.

To sum up, diversification, disciplined risk management, regular evaluation, a long-term perspective, being flexible, and on occasions, adopting the contrarian approach should serve as pillars of our trading strategy. 

As always, it's vital to make informed decisions based on data and rigorous analysis rather than emotions or short-term market disruptions. 

Let's discuss this in our next meeting.
