Subject: Logic Trading Strategy Note

Dear Team,

Being successful in trading requires having a logically sound strategy that is designed, implemented, and reviewed daily based on the varying global market conditions. As Cole's trading assistant, here's the logic strategy overview we will be pursuing in the upcoming period:

1. Diversification: We must ensure that our investments are spread across different asset classes (equities, bonds, commodities) and geographical regions to minimize risk exposure. 

2. Fundamental Analysis: We need to understand the intrinsic value of a stock or commodity by assessing relevant economic and financial factors before making investment decisions.

3. Technical Analysis: This involves analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity such as price movement and volume. It entails using charts and indicators to forecast future price movements.

4. Risk Management: This involves setting stop-loss and take-profit levels for each trade. The losses we can tolerate should determine the risk per trade. 

5. Regular Monitoring: Continual monitoring of open trades and the global markets are vital to know when to exit a trade or adjust our approach. 

6. Market Trends: We must acknowledge the direction of the overall market and align our investments in the same direction as the trend unless compelling reasons warrant otherwise. 

7. Constant Learning: The world of trading is dynamic; therefore, updating our knowledge is imperative to uncover new patterns, trends, or techniques. 

8. Discipline and Patience: Discretionary emotions should never affect our trading decisions. Being patient in waiting for the right trade that fits our criteria is crucial.

To sum up, our logical trading strategy will be a Balanced, well-researched approach with continuous learning and regular adaptation to changing market conditions. 

Please feel free to share your views and inputs on the above strategy.

Best Regards,

Assistant to Cole.
