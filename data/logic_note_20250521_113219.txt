Subject: Strategic Logic Approach to Trading

Dear Team,

I trust this note finds you well. I would like to outline a strategic approach to trading based on logical decision-making. The core of logic strategy lies not only in conducting fundamental and technical analyses but also in having a disciplined approach to trading.

1. **Market Awareness:** Continually stay abreast of global market activities, news, and regulatory changes. Market psychology plays a major role - our strategy should be to buy strongly into rising markets and sell-off during bear runs.

2. **Risk Management:** Establish a risk-reward ratio for every trade. A good rule of thumb to use is 3:1 - for every dollar risked, we aim to make three.

3. **Technical Analysis:** This remains a vital tool for establishing entry and exit points. It helps to mitigate risks and maximize profits. Coupling this with fundamental analysis provides for a well-rounded strategy.

4. **Emotional Discipline:** Avoiding emotional trading is a must. Every decision should be based on sound logic and analysis, not fear or greed. Setting predetermined stop and limit levels can help ensure this.

5. **Diversification:** Allocate assets among various financial instruments, sectors, and industries to reduce risk.

6. **Continuous Learning:** The financial markets are dynamic. Be committed to learning and building trading skills. Monthly review of trades to query what went well and what didn't can help spot patterns and update strategies.

7. **Adaptability:** Develop systems to adapt to changing market conditions. This could be achieved by having different sub-strategies fitting different scenarios, with the flexibility to switch between them.

8. **Fundamental Analysis:** Always be aware of the financial health, management, and competitive advantages of the companies we trade in.  

9. **Timing:** Pay attention not only on what to trade but on when to trade. Learn to time the trades and stick to the trading plan.

Overall, the primary focus of our logic trading strategy should be systematic and disciplined trading, providing us a logical approach rather than an emotional or impulsive one. Remember, there are no certainties in trading, only probabilities. The objective is to make sure we are on the right side of the odds. 

Let's strive to use intelligent pragmatism to guide us towards planned, logical trading decisions.

Best,
