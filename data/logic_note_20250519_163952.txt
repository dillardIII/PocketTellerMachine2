Subject: Comprehensive Trading Strategy 

Dear Cole, 

As we continuously strive for improved trading outcomes, I have compiled some important trading strategy guidelines to consider to help guide our decisions:

1. Sticking to the Plan: It is crucial to develop a concrete trading strategy and stick to it. Deviation can lead to unnecessary loses.

2. Risk Management: It is crucial to manage your portfolio to keep losses at a minimum. We should never risk more than a set percentage of our portfolio on a single trade.

3. Diversification: Emphasizing a diversified portfolio can both increase potential profits and mitigate risk.

4. Balancing Patience and Decisiveness: Trading requires an equilibrium of patience to wait for the right moment and instant decisiveness to execute it properly.

5. Regular Research and Learning: Continued learning including staying updated about recent market trends and the economic landscape are vital to make sound investment decisions.

6. Taking Regular Breaks: Avoid burnout and maintain an accurate perspective by taking breaks from daily screens and number checks.  

7. Dealing with Losses: Accept the fact that losses are part of the trading process. We must not let emotions dictate our trading decisions.

8. Consistently Reevaluate: Regularly reviewing and updating our trading strategy based on current market conditions, can potentially enhance our trading success.

9. Limit Orders: Using limit orders over market orders enables better price control, especially in volatile market conditions.

10. Realistic Expectations: Lastly, keeping realistic expectations can save us from unrequired stress and disappointment. Not every trade will yield huge profits, consistency is the key. 

Our survival in this dynamic trading environment depends on the effective execution of these strategies. Letâ€™s keep ourselves fully armed and prepared for the next trading session!
