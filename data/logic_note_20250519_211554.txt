Subject: Logic Strategy For Optimum Trading Performance 

Dear Team, 

Here's a comprehensive logic strategy plan to guide us in our trading endeavors:

1. Dispassionate Decision Making: It is crucial to separate emotions from trading. Always make decisions based on well-studied market data and trends rather than overconfidence or fear.

2. Diversification: Spreading investments across a wide array of financial instruments will minimize risk. However, ensure the chosen instruments align with our trading goals and risk tolerance.

3. Regular Monitoring: Trading requires constant watch. Regularly examine market trends and revise trading algorithms accordingly. Keep in mind, high-frequency trading can potentially lead to high losses; hence an eye on the market is imperative.

4. Risk Management: For every trading action, include a stop-loss order to limit potential losses. Promote the habit of not risking more than a predetermined percentage of the trading budget.

5. Consistent Learning: The trading market is highly volatile and continuously changing. Regular updating of knowledge and skills with latest market trends, advanced trading tools and strategies would be exceedingly valuable.

6. Testing and Reviewing: Regular testing of trading algorithms against historical market data is essential. Reviewing trades weekly or monthly helps in understanding which strategies worked well, and which need refining.

7. Data-based Changes: Should any changes need to be made to our current strategy, ensure that they are driven by carefully analyzed data rather than mere speculation.

The end-goal is to ensure we're maximizing profits and minimizing losses. Every trade should not be viewed as a win or lose situation, but rather a learning opportunity to inform future trading decisions.

Let's aim to build a culture that embodies patience, discipline, and constant learning to navigate through the complex trading world efficiently.
