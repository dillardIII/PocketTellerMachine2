Subject: Cole's Trading Strategy Note

Dear Team,

As Cole’s Trading Assistant, I wanted to take a moment to reaffirm our trading strategy and provide clarity on how we will be approaching our trades going forward.

1. **Risk Management:** We aim to limit our risk exposure to a maximum of 2% on each individual trade, and aim to have a total exposure of not more than 20% at any given time. Use of stop-loss orders is mandatory to manage potential loss. 

2. **Technical Analysis:** Each decision we make should be primarily based on technical analysis. Look for recognizable patterns, study the moving averages, consider the relative strength index– our ability to analyze and react to these graph patterns will be critical to our success. 

3. **Fundamental Analysis:** In conjunction with technical analysis, a basic understanding of the company we are investing in is paramount. Keep an eye on earning reports, economic indicators, etc to get a sense of market trends.

4. **Diversification:** While it's important we have focus, we must also strive for diversification to avoid stacking too much risk on one sector or stock. Aim to maintain a balance between sectors and types of investment.

5. **Patience and Consistency:** In the world of trading, patience is key. Stick to the strategy, take time to understand the market and react accordingly. Rushed decisions based on panic or greed rarely pay off. 

6. **Continuous Learning:** Markets are dynamic and constantly evolving. We should remain informed about changes in market conditions, learn from our trades, and continually refine our strategies. 

7. **Emotional Control:** Emotions can potentially ruin a profitable trading strategy. Strict adherence to the strategy will help prevent hasty trades influenced by fear or greed.

8. **Trading Journal:** Keep a record of all trades to review performance, assess strategy efficiency, and make necessary adjustments based on real, hard data.

Remember, successful trading is not about winning every trade, but about improving our win-to-loss ratio and maximizing profits. Stick to our strategy, effectively manage risk, and learn from any losses.

Let’s stay focused and work together to achieve our trading objectives.

Best,
[Your Name]
