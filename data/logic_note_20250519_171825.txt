Subject: Logic Strategy for Effective Trading 

Cole,

In the evolving financial markets, successful trading requires a well-developed and logically-constructed strategy. Here is a strategy that emphasizes logic for our trading activities:

1. **Objective Setting**: Clearly define your financial goals and resist the temptation to change them unless necessary, not out of frustration or fear. 

2. **Asset Allocation**: Consider investing in diverse asset classes, geographies, and sectors based on our financial objectives and risk tolerance. Diversification is logical as it reduces exposure to any single investment.

3. **Market Analysis**: Fundamental and technical analysis are crucial. The former includes studying the financial health, industry position, and management of companies in which we intend to invest. The latter focusses on patterns and trends, which can forecast future movements and provide logical entry and exit points.

4. **Risk Management**: Always have risk management measures in place, including stop-loss and take-profit levels. Position sizing can limit losses on any single trade, thus logically preventing any single failure from derailing our overall performance.

5. **Emotional Control**: Trading is as much an emotional discipline as a statistical one. Avoid emotional trading decisions; make logical, calculated moves instead.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review the strategy to ensure it is working. Just because a strategy was logical at some point doesn't mean it remains so indefinitely.

Remember, even the most logical strategy will sometimes fail given the nature of the markets. It is crucial not to abandon our trading strategy at the first sign of a setback. Instead, we should be consistent, patient, and allow the laws of probability to work in our favor over time.

Best,
