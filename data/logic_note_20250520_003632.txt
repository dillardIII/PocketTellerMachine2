Subject: Logic Strategy for Trading â€“ Insights and Recommendations 

Hello Cole,

As you continue your trading journey, it's vital to formulate a logic strategy that can guide your decision-making process. Here are some key insights and recommendations for developing a feasible logic strategy:

1. **Disciplined Approach**: Trading requires a disciplined approach. Set clear guidelines regarding when to purchase or sell a stock based on individual price targets or percentage returns. 
   
2. **Diversification**: Invest in a wide assortment of assets to manage risk. A well-diversified portfolio can potentially yield a better return due to the varied performance of different sectors.

3. **Consistent Analysis**: Constantly analyze the market and re-assess your strategy. Use techniques like fundamental analysis to examine company-specific factors and technical analysis for price patterns and trends. 

4. **Use Stop-Loss Orders**: These are designed to limit an investor's loss on a position in a security. Determine your risk tolerance and set stop-loss orders accordingly to manage potential losses.

5. **Emotion Control**: Develop mechanisms for emotional control. Investing decisions based on fear or greed often result in poor outcomes. 

6. **Adherence to Strategy**: Follow your trading plan and don't deviate due to market fluctuations or external opinions. It's easy to get sidetracked in volatile markets, but consistency is key. 

7. **Continued Learning`: Stay updated with financial news and developments in the stock market. Knowledge is a powerful tool, and the more informed you are, the better your trading decisions will be.

8. **Risk Management**: Determine the level of risk you are comfortable with and ensure investments align with this risk profile. Never invest more money than you can afford to lose. 

9. **Long-term perspective**: Remember that trading is not a get-rich-quick scheme. Maintaining a long-term perspective can help weather market fluctuations and might lead to substantial returns over time. 

10. **Performance Evaluation**: Make it a habit to regularly review your trading performance. This will help you assess your approach, take corrective actions if needed, and learn from the successes or failures. 

These well-tested principles should form the backbone of your trading strategy. Remember, there is no "one-size-fits-all" approach, so adapt these recommendations suitably as per your unique trading style and financial goals.
