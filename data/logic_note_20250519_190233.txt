Title: Strategic Approach to Trading for Increased Profitability 

1. Conduct Thorough Analysis: Start with a comprehensive macroeconomic analysis. Understand the overall market climate and the key drivers, including economic indicators, political events, and major global developments. 

2. Research and Education: Continuous learning about different trading maneuvers is crucial. Attend seminars, webinars, read about algorithmic trading, watch related news and use reliable online resources to stay informed about trading industry updates.

3. Diversification: Do not put all our eggs in one basket. Diversification minimizes risk by spreading investments across varied financial instruments, sectors, and geographical regions. 

4. Risk Management: It's important to define a risk management strategy, incorporating stop-loss and take-profit levels. The idea is to limit potential losses and not let emotions dictate trading.

5. Leveraging Technology: Utilize state-of-the-art trading platforms and tools to retrieve real-time data, immediate execution of trades, and quick confirmation. Also, algorithmic or automated trading can help minimize errors due to human bias.

6. Performance Tracking: Frequently monitor and evaluate trading performance. Understanding what went wrong in unsuccessful trades is just as crucial as knowing what worked in successful ones.

7. Regular Market Review: Markets are dynamic and can change rapidly. Regular reviews of the market help adjust our trading strategy to better align with current market conditions.

8. Time Management: Timing is everything in trading. Plan trades to capitalize on market hours. This also helps avoid rushed decisions that could lead to unnecessary losses.

9. Adherence to Plan: Consistently stick to the trading plan and strategy. Frequent alterations and deviations could lead to disorientation and potential losses.

10. Patience: Lastly, have patience. Profitable trades take time. With a well-researched strategy and disciplined approach, trading will yield positive results in the long run.

Remember, successful trading doesn't happen overnight. It's a gradual process of learning, patience, discipline, and skillful execution of well-drafted plans.
