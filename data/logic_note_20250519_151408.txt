Subject: Logic Strategy Note for Trading 

Dear Cole,

In order to optimise our trading for maximum return on investment, below are some key strategic logic points to consider:

1. Diversification: Spread our investments across a wide range of options to reduce risk. Diversification does not ensure gains or protect against losses, but it can increase our potential for long term success and balance out the rough patches. 

2. Fundamental Analysis: We need to emphasize on focusing on the intrinsic value of a company. This involves understanding the financial wellbeing, industry conditions, overall economy trajectory, and company management.

3. Technical Analysis: Apply statistical charts and analysis to predict future price movements. While not always accurate, pattern recognition can signal the right time to buy or sell.

4. Position Trading: Maintain a long-term market perspective and be less influenced by market volatility. It's about the patience and discipline to hold onto investments and let the long-term growth potential play out.

5. Dollar-Cost Averaging: Regularly invest a fixed amount regardless of the market conditions. This will often help us buy more shares when the market is low and fewer when it's high.

6. Keep Emotions in Check: Emotional decisions could potentially lead to the high buy and low sell phenomenon. Making rational decisions based on meticulous market study yields better results.

7. Monitoring and Review: Regularly monitor market situation, review portfolio performance and re-balance periodically as necessary. 

8. Continual Learning : Stay updated about market trends, new investment practices, legal regulations etc. Continuous improvement and adaptation ensure long-term success in continuously evolving markets.

As we apply these strategies, we must remember to align them with our specific financial goals, investment needs, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.  

Happy Trading!
