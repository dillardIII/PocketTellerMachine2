Subject: Cole's Trading Logic Strategy

Dear Team,

As part of our mission to continuously maintain our competitive approach in the market, we have developed a new trading logic strategy. Here is the way forward:

I. Diversify: To lower risk, we aim to diversify our portfolio by investing in different asset classes and sectors.

II. Consistent Analysis: Our team will form a dedicated analysis group that will constantly study market trends, news, and economic indicators.

III. Limit Stop Orders: To manage risk effectively, we will use limit stop orders. This way, we can place a limit on potential losses without putting a cap on potential income.

IV. Long-Term Approach: Frequent trades will be reduced significantly, as they can take up a lot of time and can attract higher costs. We'll focus instead on trades with long-term growth potential.

V. Regular Reviews: We will conduct regular portfolio reviews to ensure that continued alignment with our investment goals and risk tolerance is being maintained.

VI. Dynamic Rebalancing: We understand that market dynamics change, and so will our investment strategy. Dynamic rebalancing will help us to keep our portfolio in line with our intended asset allocation strategy.

VII. Technology Integration: Our team will use modern technologies for algorithmic trading and automated risk assessment which will be beneficial for quick decision-making and trading process execution.

VIII. Emotion-free Trade: Our strategies will based on analysis and rational decision making, eliminating any possibility of emotional trading.

These steps form an outline for our trading strategy going forward. Considering the marketâ€™s unpredictable nature, remaining flexible and adapting to new methods and strategies while maintaining our trading logic will be critical. 

Our ultimate goal is to grow our portfolio while managing the associated risks effectively.

Best,
