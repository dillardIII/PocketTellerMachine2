Title: Trading Strategy Plan for Effective Trading

1. Diversify Investments: A common, smart strategy in trading is diversification. It is important not to put all eggs in one basket. Diversify investments across different asset types and sectors to spread the risk.

2. Focus on Long-Term Goals: Rather than focusing on short-term gains, aim for long-term goals. Short-term market volatility should not affect long-term investments or decisions. 

3. Regular Review: Regularly review portfolio and strategy in response to changes in the market and personal circumstances. This could include re-allocating investments or reconsidering risk tolerance.

4. Risk Management: Understanding and applying prudent risk management principles is crucial. One should know how much loss they can afford to bear in worst-case scenarios.

5. Continuous Learning: Stay updated with market trends, updates in trading technology, and economic developments. Regularly educate yourself to make informed decisions.

6. Regular Research: Regularly research potential investments and not solely depend on third-party analysis. Keep an eye on political climates, sector growth, company performance, and more.

7. Embrace Technology: Technology significantly simplifies trading. Use it to efficiently analyse historical data, track market trends and execute trades whenever necessary.

8. Maintain Discipline: Do not let emotions control trading decisions. Consistency, patience, and discipline are key to successful trading. Stick to the strategy, even during unfavorable market conditions.

9. Rebalance Portfolio: Periodically rebalance your portfolio to ensure it reflects your current investment objectives, risk tolerance and financial goals.

10. Use Trading Tools: Utilize trading tools for analysis and decision making. Use charts for technical analysis and financial news for fundamental analysis.

Please note that trading involves risks, therefore it is recommended to have a well-thought-out strategy to manage risks effectively while aiming to maximize return on investment.
