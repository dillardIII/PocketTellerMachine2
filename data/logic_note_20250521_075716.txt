Title: Strategic Trading Framework

Objective: To maximize capital returns and minimize risk exposure 

1. Diversification: Do not put all the eggs in one basket. Allocate investments among different financial instruments, industries, and other categories.

2. Portfolio Analysis: Regularly review the portfolio to identify and rectify any deviations from the planned asset allocation strategy. Strict adherence to the assigned portfolio optimizes returns and limits risks.

3. Long Term Vision: While short term changes in the market are challenging to predict, long term trends provide a reliable indication of growth. Eye a long term perspective when investing.

4. Risk-Reward Ratio: Use a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:3 to evaluate potential trades. This means for every unit of risk taken; we should anticipate at least three units of reward.

5. Market Research: Make informed decisions by staying updated with news, financial reports, and trend analyses. Never rely on rumours or tip-offs.

6. Technical and Fundamental Analysis: Use both analytical methods to get a comprehensive view - while fundamental analysis helps in determining the intrinsic value of an asset, technical analysis aids in identifying trends and patterns.

7. Set Realistic Goals: Aim for consistent growth, not overnight riches. A steady rate of return can help compound investments over time and lead to substantial growth.

8. Disciplined Approach: Stick to the plan, irrespective of market volatility, losses, or unanticipated short-term trends. It's key to making sound, bias-free decisions.

9. Regular Reviews: Regularly review and reassess the chosen strategy. Adjust the plan according to any changes in financial goals, market conditions, or personal circumstances.

10. Contingency Planning: Have a contingency plan for all circumstances. This includes stop loss orders to limit potential losses or having a cash reserve for absorbing shocks or taking advantage of opportunities.

Remember, successful trading is not about making gains on every trade, but about overall profitability. Stay patient, persistent, and disciplined.
