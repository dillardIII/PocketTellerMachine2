Title: Strategic Logic to Boost Cole's Trading Performance 

Objective: Increase profitability and manage risk in Cole's trading portfolio.

1. Diversification: Diversifying Cole's portfolio is a key risk management strategy. Investments should be spread across different asset classes, sectors, and geographies to reduce potential investment risks.

2. Regular Monitoring: Keep a close watch on market trends, economic news and events. Regular portfolio reviews to identify improvements, deficiencies and necessary alterations.

3. Risk Assessment: Evaluate Cole's risk tolerance levels. Position size should be calibrated to avoid excessive potential loss. Use investment tools like stop-loss orders to limit potential losses.

4. Timing: Identify the best time to enter and exit trades. Keep a long-term perspective and avoid impulsive trading decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. 

5. Research and Analysis: Use fundamental and technical analysis to make informed trading decisions. The fundamental analysis involves assessing economic indicators, while technical analysis observes price movements and trends in financial markets. 

6. Leverage and Margin: Use leverage cautiously in trading as it not only multiplies profits but can also increase losses. Maintain adequate margin in the trading account to keep positions open. 

7. Keeping Emotions in Check: Avoid letting emotions drive trading decisions. Stay disciplined and stick to the predetermined trading strategy.

8. Continuous Learning: Trading is a continuous learning process. Stay updated with new trading methods, strategies, and investment tools.

9. Setting Realistic Goals: Set realistic profit targets and always take into account the risk/reward ratio before entering into any trade.

10. Robotic Trading: Consider use of algorithmic trading for increased efficiency and the ability to react instantly to market changes.

Consistency in adherence to this strategic logic framework can potentially assist in bolstering the overall trading returns, while still carefully managing risk exposure. This strategy needs to be flexible and adaptable to adjust with evolving markets dynamics.
