Subject: Optimization of Our Trading Strategy

Dear Cole,

Our main objective is to maximize return on investment whilst mitigating risk. To achieve this, we need to implement logic-based trading strategies to ensure enhanced drive on trading decisions rather than emotional influence. Below are the key aspects that should be considered in our approach:

1. **Entry & Exit Points:** We need to plan our entry and exit points based on careful technical analysis. For instance, if we consider the 'breakout' strategy, we'll buy when prices break above resistance or sell when they break below support.

2. **Trend Following:** This strategy is premised on the idea that markets that have risen in the past, will continue to do so for some time. We should identify the medium or long-term trend and follow it, initiating trades that align with the trend rather than against it.

3. **Risk Management:** A crucial aspect of trading is managing risk. It is necessary to apply stop-loss orders on every open position to limit potential losses in case the market moves against our prediction. Our risk on each trade should be limited to a certain percentage of our total capital.

4. **Diversification:** We should spread our investments across different types of securities (stocks, bonds, commodities, etc.) to avoid excessive exposure to a single asset. 

5. **Position Sizing:** Adjusting position sizes is a method to balance the risk-to-reward ratio. For instance, we might opt for larger positions on high-probability trades and reduce size on lower-probability trades. 

6. **Fundamental Analysis:** Our decisions should also consider the fundamentals of traded assets, the state of the economy, interest rates, etc. 

7. **Tracking Performance:** To refine our approach, we must regularly track and analyze our trading decisions and their outcomes. This will help identify which strategies work well and which need adjustment.

In conclusion, developing a robust trading strategy is not a one-time task but requires continuous learning, adaptation, and fine-tuning over time. The key is to stay disciplined and stick to our strategy, maintaining an unbiased stance regardless of market circumstances.
