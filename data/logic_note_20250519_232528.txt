Subject: Logic Strategy Note for Future Trading Activities

Dear Team,

I hope this note finds you well. In our constant endeavor to enhance profitability and manage risk, it's crucial that we align our trading efforts uniformly. This strategy note will cover some basic principles and logical strategies that we should follow routinely.

1. Diversification: This principle underlines the importance of not putting all our eggs into one basket. Diversify across instruments, markets, and timeframes to reduce risk and increase the chances of getting a return on investment.

2. Fundamental & Technical Analysis: An informed decision is always profitable. Observe the market trends, news, and events. Utilize methods of technical analysis like Trend following, Moving averages, Boll signals etc., while balancing with fundamental factors that drive the price changes.

3. Setting Stop Losses: This strategy works as an exit plan in case a trade doesn't go the way one might anticipate. It prevents losses from going beyond a pre-decided point.

4. Position Sizing: Never risk more than a small percentage of your total trading portfolio on any single trade. A guideline could be not going beyond 2%.

5. Follow the Trend: It is logical and profitable to go with the overall market trend rather than to predict or go against it. Remember, 'The trend is your friend'.

6. Maintain Discipline and Patience: Trading demands discipline in order to maintain the strategies, and patience to wait for the perfect opportunities.

7. Continuous Learning: The market is dynamic and changes frequently. Keep your trading knowledge upgraded.

8. Risk Management: Above all, managing how much risk you take on in trades is of paramount importance. The key to long-term success isn't in the occasional big winner, but in preventing the frequent big losers. 

Please note that there is no absolute formula or strategy that guarantees trading success. Understanding market dynamics and adhering to these logical strategies will, however, certainly improve outcomes. Let's stay aligned and remember to put the principles into practice.
