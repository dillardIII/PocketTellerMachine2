Subject: Trading Strategy Fundamentals and Guidelines

Dear Cole,

As we navigate through this complex trading jungle, I propose the following coherent and adaptable trading strategy. Our main objective is to minimize risk while maximizing the potential returns. Here's the approach in detail:

1. Trend Following: We keep an eye on the market trends both on a macro and micro level, realigning our assets according to which way the wind is blowing.

2. Diversification: Spreading assets across a wide range of investment avenues is key. It curtails the risk of capital reduction, providing a safety net against market volatility.

3. Balance: Maintain a healthy balance between high-risk, high-yield assets and safer, low-yield ones. Although an aggressive approach can yield profit, conservative investments provide solid backing.

4. Regular Review System: Implement a consistent check-up system for reviewing our portfolio, monitoring the efficiency of our investments, and replace or rebalance them accordingly.

5. Risk Management: Establish a robust risk management system - this includes setting up stop-loss levels, forecasting potential risks, and being ready to make necessary adjustments when required.

6. Patience and Discipline: Stick to our strategy, even when markets are shaky. We must also accept that losses are part and parcel of the trading industry. Stay patient and consistent.

7. Research, Learn and Adapt: Continuously stay updated with market trends, industry insights, and technical analyses. An informed trader is an effective trader. 

8. Objective Evaluation: We should practice strict, objective evaluations of our trading results. What worked? What didn't? What can we do differently? This allows us to learn and grow from our experiences.

9. Leverage Responsibly: While leverage can magnify profits, it can also intensify losses. We should use leverage judiciously, sticking to our risk management guidelines.

Remember, consistency is key in developing a successful trading approach. The above-outlined strategy is flexible enough to be adjusted as per the dynamics and flow of the market.
