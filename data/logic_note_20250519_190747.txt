Subject: Logic Strategy for Trading 

Dear Team,

In order to best meet our objectives and propose a clear path forward, the following is a strategy for our trading activities based on logic for the next quarter.

1. Analyzing Market Trends:

Every decision we make should be backed by rigorous research and analytical understanding of the market. Observing and understanding the trends can better educate us about when to trade, what to trade, and what to anticipate in our industry. 

2. Risk Management: 

Risks in trading are inevitable, our plan should always incorporate steps to manage and mitigate these risks. Best suit methods can be setting stop orders or diversifying our portfolio. Our logic might not always match up with market activities, however, by limiting our losses, we can secure our net returns.

3. Consistent Evaluation:

Measurement and management through metrics is indispensable. An on-going evaluation of our performing stocks and ones lagging behind will identify our strengths and weaknesses. This will help us make informed decisions around strengthening our strong suits and addressing our weak spots.

4. Strategic Allocation:

Using a logic-driven approach to allocation can greatly increase our chances of success. This may involve parting from conventional wisdom, and instead meticulously assessing each opportunity for its potential ROI.

5. Never trading with emotions:

Not getting swayed by market rumors and refraining from making impulsive decisions forms the crux of logical trading. Creating disciplined trading habits, we stick to our robust strategy in the face of market volatilities.

Remember, our actions should be driven by logic and grounded in analysis. It's crucial that we do not let market noise divert us from our strategic mission.

Let's continue to make informed decisions, backed by quantifiable data and solid logic. Your cooperation and adherence to the strategy is much appreciated.

Best,
[Your Name]
