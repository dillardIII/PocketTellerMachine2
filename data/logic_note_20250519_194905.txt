Subject: Logic Strategy Note

Dear Team,

As we move into the next quarter, I'd like to outline some key logics we need to employ in order to maximize our trading operations and returns:

1. Research-Oriented Approach - This is fundamental in predicting trading outcomes. Use data to understand market trends, and forecast future movements. 

2. Risk Management - We need to ensure an effective risk management layer in our trading logic. Not all trades will yield positive returns, however, we can minimise any potential losses through a well-crafted risk management strategy.

3. Diversification - Don't put all eggs in one basket. Investing in a wide range of assets will effectively spread risk and likely reduce potential damage.

4. Consistent Review - Don't set-and-forget. Markets are dynamic and constantly changing. Regularly monitor your trades and investments, adjust parameters as necessary to suit ever-changing market conditions.

5. Discipline - Stay loyal to your trading plan. No knee-jerk reactions to market volatility. Stick to logic, not emotion.

6. Patience – Success in trading doesn’t happen overnight. Understand the importance of long-term growth over short term gains. 

These are guidelines that should steer our trading strategy. Following these will help us achieve our trading goals and deliver solid returns.

Best,
[Your Name]
