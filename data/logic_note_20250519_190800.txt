Subject: Trading Strategy and Market Analysis

Dear Cole,

As we continue to strengthen our trading strategies, my observation shows that the market's current status requires us to make some adjustments. Below, I am highlighting key strategic adjustments.

1. Diversification: With uncertainties in many economies due to current global events, it is essential to spread capital across different investment tools. This approach reduces potential downside risk.

2. Long-term Investment: Consider focusing more on long-term investment strategies. Blue-chip stocks, Marco-cap stocks, and government bonds might be a good starting point.

3. Regular Portfolio Rebalancing: Regularly assess the portfolio to ensure it aligns with our financial goals. If any investment shows huge variance, rebalance the portfolio to its target allocation.

4. Market Trend Analysis: Continual monitoring of market trends and conditions will provide a clear outlook about when to buy or sell our securities. 

5. Risk Management: Consider investing proportionately in risk-free or lower-risk securities to balance out riskier, high-return investments.

6. Technical Analysis: Use this to predict price movements and trends based on past market data.

7. Utilize Trailing Stop Orders: This approach ensures that our losses are minimized by selling a stock when its price declines to a certain point.

Above all, I recommend thorough due diligence before making any changes and focusing on education to understand the changing dynamics of the trading world.

Please consider these strategies as you plan the next trading steps, and feel free to discuss any uncertainties you might have.
