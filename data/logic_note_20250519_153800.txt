Subject: Logic Trading Strategy 

Dear Team,

As we navigate the tumultuous financial landscape, it's increasingly vital that our trading actions are guided by a strategic plan characterized by logical, careful decision-making. Here's an outline for a Logic Trading Strategy we should consider:

1. Stay Informed: Keep updated with the financial news and updates around the world, focusing on the sectors we are trading in. Regularly analyze reports of companies we are interested in, and be aware of any upcoming events that may affect the market.

2. Always Analyze: Don't make any trading decisions based on impulse or speculation. Instead, rely on available data, charts, patterns and trends. Use both fundamental and technical analysis to arrive at decisions.

3. Discipline: Set clear, defined rules with an emphasis on selling and buying. Once a decision is made based on analysis, stick to it. Make use of stop-loss and take-profit levels to limit losses and secure profits.

4. Diversify: Don't place all assets in one basket. Spread investments across various sectors to reduce risk. Look for investment opportunities in multiple various markets.

5. Risk Management: Establish a risk/reward ratio for every trade. Ascertain the potential loss before considering potential gain. Never risk more than a predetermined percentage of the trading account on a single trade.

6. Regular Review: Following our trades, we should review whether the logic held up. What did we miss, and what can we learn? This will improve our strategy continually.

7. Adaptability: Our strategy must be flexible to adapt to market changes. Always be ready to update the strategy when necessary based on market movements and trends.

Remember, the goal is long-term growth, and that requires patience, discipline and a logical approach to trading. Any questions or thoughts on this strategy, feel free to share.

Best,
