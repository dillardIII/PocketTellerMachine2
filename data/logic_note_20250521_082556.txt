Title: Strategic Trading Approach

Objective: To outline an effective trading strategy that guarantees maximum return on investment.

Key Strategies:

1. Asset Allocation: Divide investment portfolio across various asset classes (equity, bonds, commodities, etc.). The allocation will depend on Cole's risk profile. 

2. Diversification: We should invest in different sectors like technology, healthcare, energy, and consumer goods. It helps to reduce risk by offsetting loses in one sector with gains in another.

3. Monitor Market Movements: Keep a close watch on market movements and trends. Use technical indicators and fundamental analysis tools for identifying potential profitable opportunities.

4. Cole's Financial Goals: Investments should be aligned with Cole's financial goals. If he is aiming for short term profits, we can look at day trading or swing trading. For long-term wealth accumulation, we can consider options like buy and hold strategy.

5. Risk Management: One of the key parts of any strategy is managing risk. Using stop loss orders, avoiding investing more than a set percentage in any one position, and only investing money that can be risked are all important measures.

6. Regular Review: The performance of trades should be regularly reviewed. It helps in identifying what's working and what's not, thus tweaking the strategy accordingly.
   
7. Stay Informed: Staying informed about the general economic outlook and specific company news will help to identify investment opportunities and threats.
   
8. Discipline and Consistency: Stick to the strategy once it's made. Emotional decisions driven by greed or fear often lead to mistakes.

In conclusion, it is crucial to have a trading strategy that suits the investor's risk appetite, goals, and market understanding. It's equally important to be adaptable and flexible, ready to adjust the strategy with changing market conditions.
