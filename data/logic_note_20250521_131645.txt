Subject: Logic Strategy for Trading

Dear Team,

The market is a dynamic environment that continuously challenges our understandings and assumptions. It necessitates the construction of a multi-dimensional trading strategy, built on robust logical foundations. 

1. **Understanding the market:** This is where our journey must begin. Before developing a strategy, it is crucial to understand various market indicators, including movements in indices, the performance of key stocks, and recent market trends. 

2. **Diversification:** Reduced risk is a by-product of diversification. By diversifying our investments amongst different asset classes and various sectors, we decrease the potential damage of a singular poor-performing investment. 

3. **Focus on Quality:** Quality should always be preferential to quantity. It's advisable to build a portfolio around a handful of carefully chosen assets, each supported by solid fundamentals, instead of an indiscriminate, vast array of assets that might be hard to manage due to their sheer number. 

4. **Market trends:** Our trading decisions should align with broader market trends. If we're trading against the market, we need to have a strong rationale for doing so. It is less risky to swim with the tide than against it. 

5. **Risk Management:** We need to determine the acceptable level of risk beforehand. Emotion-based decisions often lead to unnecessary risks. It's important to set target prices and stop losses for every trade.

6. **Continuous Learning:** The market landscape is ever-changing; thus, continuous learning is our key to staying updated to attain an edge over competitors. We should also learn from our past successes and failures.

7. **Use of Technology:** Utilizing technology to access real-time market information and using tools for better analysis is recommended. Algorithms can also help in decision making, and AI-powered tools can predict market trends more accurately.

8. **Patience:** Lastly, patience is an integral part of the trading strategy. Some trades need time to bear fruit. Hasty decisions can disturb asset growth potential.

The concoction of the above-mentioned elements, blended correctly, will help in the formation of a logic-based, practical, and efficient trading strategy. The approach to trading must be systematic, disciplined, and methodical. We must continually analyze, learn, and adapt based on our experiences and changing market dynamics.

Best,
