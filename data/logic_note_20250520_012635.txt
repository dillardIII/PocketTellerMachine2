Subject: Logic Strategy Note 

Dear Cole,

Given the dynamic nature of today's trade markets, it is imperative to ensure that we maintain a step-by-step strategy to maximize results. I suggest the following logical strategic approach.

1. **Thorough Market Research:** In-depth and continual market research will act as the foundation of all our decisions. By staying updated about current trading trends and market fluctuations, we can make informed decisions.

2. **Percentile-based Risk Management:** We must follow a disciplined approach when it comes to managing risk. I suggest allocating a predefined percentage of our capital to each trade (typically not more than 1-2%). This prevents harmful losses and aids in maintaining portfolio balance.

3. **Diversification:** Investments should be spread across multiple instruments to mitigate risk. A balanced portfolio composed of varied asset classes always offers better resistance to market volatility.

4. **Annual and Quarterly Review:** A thorough check on investment performance should be done on a quarterly and annual basis. This would help us in identifying non-performing assets and shifting resources to more profitable ventures.

5. **Adherence to Stop-Loss Rules:** Setting a stop-loss level for each trade will take the emotion out of trading decisions and can effectively limit potential losses.

6. **Adapting to Changes:** Stock markets are bound to change. As your trading assistant, it is not only my job to facilitate trades but also to reassure and educate about necessary adaptations that might emerge due to transforming market conditions.

7. **Utilizing Technology:** To gain competitive edge, we must utilize technological resources like trading bots, advanced algorithms, and financial models for predicting market trends.

8. **Compliance:** We must always ensure that our trading operations are compliant with legal regulations and ethical considerations.

Above all, the logic strategy should focus on patience, discipline and no rush-trading. Remember, the focus is long-term capital growth and not instant gains. 

Looking forward to your feedback on this proposed strategy. 

Best regards,
