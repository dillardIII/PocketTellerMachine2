Subject: Logic Strategy Note for Trading 

Dear Team,

In line with our trading protocols and anticipating potential market movements, the following logic strategy serves as a reminder of how to execute each trade as efficiently as possible.

1. Informed Decision-Making: Utilize the information and analysis from trusted sources, such as Bloomberg, Reuters, Financial Times, as well as our internal trading algorithms, to make informed decisions. Avoid impulsive decisions based on hearsay or speculation.

2. Maintain Discipline: Understanding that markets can often be unpredictable, it is crucial to remain disciplined in executing our trading strategy. This includes sticking to stop-loss orders and not allowing emotions to influence trading decisions.

3. Diversification: Diversify the investment portfolio to spread the risk. Investing in different assets and varying sectors will optimize the return-on-investment while minimizing risk exposure.

4. Risk Management: Always calculate the risk-reward ratio before executing a trade. No trade should risk more than a predetermined percentage of the trading account. This approach will safeguard our assets during unforeseen market volatilities.

5. Long-Term Strategy: Focus on long-term strategy for steady returns as opposed to short-term market fluctuations. Adjust trading strategies to align them with the overall market cycle.

6. Consistent Monitoring: Keep a close watch on both domestic and international financial news that might influence market trends or specific assets. 

7. Clear Communication: Consistently communicate within the trading team about potential opportunities, pitfalls and insights to ensure that we all operate from the most well-informed point of view.

Remember, the ultimate measure of a successful trading strategy is not solely its profitability, but its consistency, sustainability, and adaptability against varying market conditions. Let's keep focused and patient, allowing our well-thought strategies to yield the best possible returns.

Best,

[Your Name]
