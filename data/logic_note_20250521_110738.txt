Subject: Strategic Trading Logic

-------

Dear Team,

I wanted to share a concise yet comprehensive perspective on our trading strategy guided by logical analytical frameworks aiming at optimising returns while mitigating potential risks. The steps below serve as a roadmap to better our trading approach:

1. **Identifying** - This step requires to scout potential opportunities present in the market. Research diligently on key assets to comprehend their market stature.

2. **Planning** - Draft a strategy that explicitly mentions the 'entry point' and 'exit point', considering factors such as volatility, liquidity, economic indicators and company's financial health. 

3. **Risk Management** - Identify a maximum risk threshold not to be crossed for each trade. Even if the trade appears promising, the risk applied should not exceed this pre-determined level.

4. **Diversifying Portfolio** - Aim to have a diverse portfolio across multiple industries and a range of assets. Diversification aids in spreading risk, thus, potentially increasing chances of overall portfolio profitability. 

5. **Re-balancing Portfolio** - Depending upon the market conditions, restructure your portfolio timely to maintain its robustness against market volatilities.

6. **Emotion Control** - Itâ€™s important to stay composed and grounded, irrespective of whether a trade is profitable or not. Emotional decisions could compromise logical ones.

7. **Continual Learning** - The market is dynamic and requires continual learning. Be open to new investment strategies and understand the changing trends.

8. **Performance Review** - Regularly review and measure trade performance to identify any patterns, weaknesses, or strengths that can be improved upon. 

Remember, our focus is to create a balanced and growth-focused portfolio. 

Happy trading,
