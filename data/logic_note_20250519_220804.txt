Subject: Logic Strategy Note 

Dear Team, 

In the course of our trading activities, it is essential that we navigate our decisions through a logical and rational strategy. In this spirit, I want to outline some core elements of our trading strategy.

1. **Risk Management:** First and foremost, we should always be aware of our risk tolerance. Never risk more than you are comfortable losing. This should inform the number of trades we can afford to undertake and the risk-reward ratios we should be comfortable with.

2. **Market Analysis:** We should always strive to understand and keep up-to-date with the broader market trends and indicators. Behavioural economics and sentiment analysis could offer valuable insights into potential market directions. 

3. **Diversification:** We should never put all our eggs in one basket. Diversification across different assets and industries can provide a safety net against market volatility and reduce potential losses.

4. **Consistent Review:** We should always be on the lookout for points of improvement. Regularly reviewing our trading performance and tweaking our strategy based on real-time trading experience is critical.

5. **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Emotional decisions have no place in trading. We must always back our decisions with solid data and in-depth, rational analysis. 

6. **Long-Term Vision:** Although we are in the trading business, we should not lose sight of our long-term investment goals. Balancing short-term profitability with long-term sustainable growth should form part of our strategic decision-making process.

7. **Adaptability:** The only constant in the financial markets is change. We must be ready to adapt our investment strategy in response to sudden market shifts.

Our focus should always be on a systematic, objective approach to decision making. Always sticking to the strategy, being patient and not panicking during market instability will be crucial for our teamâ€™s success.

Kindly ensure this strategy is embedded into your daily operations.

Best Regards,

[Your Name]
