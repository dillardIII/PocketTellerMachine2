Sure, I can help you with that. However, I need more specific details about the task. 'Momentum Screener Bot' could mean a variety of things. Are you looking to screen stocks based on their momentum? If so, what specific metrics are you interested in? 

Here's a simple example of how you might set up a momentum screener bot using the yfinance library to get stock data:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

def calculate_momentum(price_data, period):
    return price_data.diff(period) / price_data.shift(period)

def momentum_screener(tickers, period):
    momentum_data = {}
    for ticker in tickers:
        data = yf.download(ticker, period="1y")
        close = data['Close']
        momentum = calculate_momentum(close, period)
        momentum_data[ticker] = momentum.iloc[-1]
    return momentum_data

tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL']  # Add any tickers you want to screen
momentum_data = momentum_screener(tickers, 30)  # Calculate 30-day momentum

# Print tickers sorted by momentum
sorted_tickers = sorted(momentum_data, key=momentum_data.get, reverse=True)
for ticker in sorted_tickers:
    print(f'{ticker}: {momentum_data[ticker]}')
```

This script calculates the 30-day momentum for a list of tickers and prints them sorted by momentum. The momentum is calculated as the percentage change in the closing price over the specified period.

Please note that this is a very basic example. Real-world momentum screening would involve more complex calculations and might take into account other factors, such as trading volume or other technical indicators.
