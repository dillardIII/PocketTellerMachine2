Subject: Strategic Logic Trading Approach

Dear Team,

In the unpredictable world of investing, it is crucial to formulate a sound strategy rooted in logic to ensure profitability and minimize risks. Integrating logic into our trading strategy can help us make more rational and less emotional decisions. Here's a suggested approach:

1. **Thorough Fundamental Analysis:** Understanding a company's fundamentals, financial health, industry competition, and market positioning is the foundation of any logic-based trading strategy. 

2. **Technical Analysis:** With the help of indicators such as moving averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and trend lines, we can have a logic-based prediction of future price movements. This will be used to time our entry and exit points.

3. **Diversification:** A key component of logical trading strategies is risk management. Diversifying our portfolio across different asset types, industries, and geographies can help cushion against market volatilities and lower risk.

4. **Disciplined and Patient Approach:** Stick to the plan. Emotional decision-making can lead to poor outcomes. It is important to be patient and wait for the right opportunity, as dictated by our logical analysis.

5. **Continuous Learning and Adaptation:** The market is dynamic and ever-evolving. Our strategies should also adapt accordingly through continuous learning and adjustment. 

6. **Regular Performance Evaluation:** Assess the portfolio's performance regularly against set benchmarks and objectives. This helps identify any potential issues, areas for improvement, or necessary modifications to the strategy.

This structured logic-driven framework provides us with a roadmap to navigate the financial market intelligibly and strategically. Let's ensure we revisit this strategy periodically, adjust based on market conditions and our investment objectives, and continue to create opportunities for growth.

Best,

[Your Name],
Trading Assistant to Cole.
