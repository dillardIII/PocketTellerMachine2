Subject: Logic Strategy Note 

Dear Team,

Despite the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of trading, a well-defined logic-based strategy can significantly increase our probability of success. Below is an outline of a proposed logic-based trading strategy to guide our future transactions:

1. Research and Analysis: Perform comprehensive research on diverse markets and potential investment options. Utilize data analysis software to dissect data and identify trends, irregularities, and potential opportunities.

2. Planning: Based on the findings from our research, we should create a plan detailing when and where to make trades. This plan should include clear objectives and quantifiable goals.

3. Risk Assessment: Before making any trades, perform a thorough risk assessment which includes calculating potential loss. Only embark on trades where potential rewards outweigh the projected risks.

4. Diversification: Maintain a diverse portfolio. This includes different asset types, sectors and geographies. Diversification reduces vulnerability to market volatility.

5. Trade Execution: When executing trades, follow the pre-established plan and resist the temptation to make impulsive decisions based on market fluctuations.

6. Consistent Monitoring: Keep a diligent watch of the market trends, emerging opportunities, and potential threats. Remember that the market environment is always changing, and this requires a flexible strategy.

7. Feedback Loop: Review all trades regularly, study the outcomes (whether gains or losses) and extract essential lessons. This will create a feedback loop that informs future trades.

8. Emotional Control: It is crucial to keep emotions like greed, fear, and over-excitement detached from our trading decisions. Decisions should always be rooted in facts, figures, and logical reasoning.

Remember, the central idea behind this strategy is to be proactive, not reactive. We need to ensure that our decisions are deliberate, calculated, and always ten steps ahead of the market's movements. The strategy's success heavily relies on discipline, consistency, and continuous learning. 

Best Regards,
