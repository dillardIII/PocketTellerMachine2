Subject: Strategic Action Plan for Effectual Trading 

Dear Team,

In order to achieve the utmost potential of our trading activities and align them with our strategic objectives, it becomes critical to implement a comprehensive logic strategy in our trade executions. Following are the steps we propose:

1. Detailed Market Research: Base all trading decisions on comprehensive and detailed market research. Use historic data, market trends, and economic statistics to make informed decisions. 

2. Diversification: Spreading investments across a diverse range of assets could be a logical precaution against significant losses.

3. Risk Management: Identify and assess potential risks in every trade, and devise appropriate mitigation strategies. Never risk more than a predetermined percentage of the portfolio on a single trade.

4. Short-term and Long-term Balancing: Maintain a balanced portfolio with a mix of short-term and long-term investments. 

5. Continuous Learning: Stay up to date with market trends and financial news. Enhanced knowledge generally translates to better trading strategies. 

6. Utilize Stop Losses: Oversee every trade regularly. If a trade doesn't work as anticipated, have a stop loss order in place. This should help to limit potential losses.

7. Keep Emotions in Check: Trading decisions should always be based on logical analysis, not emotional responses. 

8. Evaluate Performance Periodically: Regularly review trade performance to pinpoint successful strategies and areas for improvement. 

9. Consistency: Develop consistent strategies based on proven methodologies. Consistent decision scoring helps in long-term profitability.

10. Control Leverage: While leverage might amplify gains, it might also increase losses. Itâ€™s essential to control and manage it appropriately. 

These steps provide us with a holistic trading approach, enabling us to better predict potential outcomes and tackle unforeseen circumstances. It is important to note that patience and discipline are key to trading successfully.
