Subject: Logic Strategy for Effective Trading 

Dear team,

While trading requires diligent attention to market movements, patterns, and trends, developing and sticking to a logical strategy is absolutely critical for achieving consistent gains and mitigating potential losses. Below are key points we should consider when formulating our trading strategy:

1. Goal Setting: Every strategy starts with a clear goal in mind. Whether the aim is aggressive growth or preservation of capital, the strategy we formulate should reflect this.

2. Comprehensive Market Analysis: Employ both technical and fundamental analyses. While technical analysis focuses on pattern recognition in market movements, fundamental analysis looks at 'real-world' events such as economic indicators and news.

3. Diversification: Spread investments across different financial instruments, industries, or geographic regions, reducing exposure to any single asset or risk. 

4. Trade Plan: Before placing any trade, a clear plan should exist detailing acceptable risk levels, expected returns, and exit points. Emotion-based trading decisions often lead to unnecessary losses.

5. Money Management: Set strict rules about the percentage of capital invested in each trade to avoid exposing a significant portion of capital to any single trade.

6. Regular Review: As markets constantly change, it's important to regularly review and adjust our trading strategy accordingly. This will ensure we remain aligned with trading goals and market conditions.

7. Continuous Learning: Markets are complex and ever-evolving. Successful trading requires keeping abreast of new techniques, tools, and market dynamics.

Remember, our main goal is to make investment decisions that are analytical, not emotional. Trading with a logical plan offers a structure amidst the market's inherent unpredictability. 

Let us proceed with caution, strategic approach, and logical decision-making. Looking forward to achieving optimal trading performance as a team!

Best Regards,
