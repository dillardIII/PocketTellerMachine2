Subject: Trading Logic Strategy 

Dear Cole,

I would like to outline the following strategy which could potentially enhance our trading results.

1. **Understand the Market:** As traders, our primary job is to understand the market well. We need to monitor market cycles and understand the key factors influencing the financial markets daily.

2. **Strict Risk Management:** Each trade should have a predetermined Stop Loss and Take Profit level. Let's never risk more than a certain percent of our trading capital on a single trade. 

3. **Maintain Discipline and Patience:** The keys to successful trading are discipline and patience. Let's not deviate from our trading plan and avoid making hasty decisions triggered by emotions.

4. **Leverage Technical Analysis:** We should leverage technical analysis as much as possible. Our trades must be based on a thorough analysis of charts, patterns, and trends.

5. **Consistent Reviewing and Learning:** Trading strategies should be adopted only after backtesting them in a demo environment. Regularly reviewing our trades will help us to continuously learn from them, and fine-tune our further strategies.

6. **Diversify Trading:** Placing all bets on one type of financial instrument increases risk. Let's diversify our trades across different products to contain risk.
   
7. **Proper Record Keeping:** I would suggest maintaining a proper record of each trade that we make. This would not only help in analyzing our results better but also help us hugely in our tax preparations.

In conclusion, this trading logic strategy is about minimizing risks and capitalizing on opportunities, rather than aiming for unrealistic profits. Looking forward to discussing more and implementing these strategies.
