This function assumes that you have a function called `run_backtest()` that runs the backtest and returns the results. If `run_backtest()` returns `None`, indicating that no backtest results were found, the function will execute the fallback strategy.\n\n```python\ndef run_backtest_with_fallback():\n    # Run the backtest\n    results = run_backtest()\n\n    # Check if the backtest returned results\n    if results is None:\n        print(\"No backtest results found. Implementing fallback strategy.\")\n\n        # Implement your fallback strategy here\n        # For example, you might want to rerun the backtest with different parameters\n        # Or you might want to alert the user or log the issue\n        # This is a simple example where we just rerun the backtest\n        results = run_backtest()\n\n        # If still no results, raise an exception\n        if results is None:\n            raise Exception(\"No backtest results found even after implementing fallback strategy.\")\n\n    return results\n```\n\nThis is a simple example and your actual fallback strategy might be more complex. For example, you might want to try running the backtest with different parameters, or you might want to alert the user or log the issue if no backtest results are found."

We then generate trading orders based on changes in this signal.\n\nFinally, we print out the potential trading opportunities for the next day. If the `positions` value is `1.0`, this indicates a potential buy order. If it's `-1.0`, this indicates a potential sell order. If it's `0.0`, this indicates no change. \n\nPlease note that this is a very basic trading strategy and may not be profitable in real-world trading.

A positive difference indicates a buy order and a negative difference indicates a sell order.\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic trading strategy and might not be profitable in real-world trading.

    "code": "Sure, here is a simple implementation of a Relative Strength Index (RSI) strategy using Python and the `pandas` library. This strategy will generate buy signals when the RSI is below 30 (oversold) and sell signals when the RSI is above 70 (overbought).\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_rsi(data, window):\n    delta = data.diff()\n    up, down = delta.copy(), delta.copy()\n    up[up < 0] = 0\n    down[down > 0] = 0\n\n    average_gain = up.rolling(window=window).mean()\n    average_loss = abs(down.rolling(window=window).mean())\n\n    rs = average_gain / average_loss\n    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))\n    return rsi\n\ndef generate_rsi_strategy(data, rsi_window=14):\n    data['RSI'] = calculate_rsi(data['Close'], rsi_window)\n    data['Buy_Signal'] = np.where(data['RSI'] < 30, 1, 0)\n    data['Sell_Signal'] = np.where(data['RSI'] > 70, 1, 0)\n    return data\n\n# Example usage:\n# Assume 'df' is a pandas DataFrame with a 'Close' column for closing prices\ndf = generate_rsi_strategy(df)\n```\n\nThis code first defines a helper function `calculate_rsi` to calculate the RSI for a given data series and window length. Then it defines the main function `generate_rsi_strategy` which adds the RSI to the input DataFrame and generates the buy and sell signals based on the RSI values.\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic strategy and should not be used for real trading without further improvements and testing."
