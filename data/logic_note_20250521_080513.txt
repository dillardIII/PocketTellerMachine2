Subject: Logic Strategy Note for Successful Trading in 2021

Dear Team,

As Cole's trading assistant, it’s my responsibility to fine-tune our trading strategies to ensure we optimize all opportunities. Highlighted below is a list of logic strategies to guide our trading decisions as we delve into 2021. 

1. **Detailed Research**: Every trading day, we need to start with research. Maintaining an understanding of the global financial market, geopolitical changes, and technology advancements should be our top priority. 

2. **Stick to the Plan**: Develop a robust and flexible plan then stick to it. It’s important to focus on accomplishing our strategy rather than chasing profits. The output – profit or loss, should be a by-product of executing our plan, not the objective.

3. **Risk Management**: Regularly evaluate risk against potential reward. We cannot afford to risk a large portion of our portfolio on any single trade. A recommended approach would be risking only a small percentage of the capital on each trade.

4. **Emotional Discipline**: Emotional stability and discipline are pivotal in this industry. Trading based on fear or greed can lead to hasty decisions. Instead, we should take a more calculated and logical approach and not let emotions dictate our moves.

5. **Continual Learning**: We should constantly be improving our trading strategies. If a trade fails, view it as a valuable lesson and use its information to refine our future strategies.

6. **Consistent Evaluation**: We should constantly be reviewing our trades. By analyzing our past successes and failures, we can identify patterns and strategies that lead to profitable results.

7. **Diversification**: Spreading our investments across various securities can mitigate risk. It's prudent not to put all eggs in one basket. 

8. **Adaptability**: Last but not least, our strategy should be adaptable to market changes. Market dynamics are constantly evolving and we must be flexible enough to adjust our strategies in response.

By adopting these logic strategies, we can increase our potential to maintain solid performances and hopefully thrive in the financial markets.

Best,
