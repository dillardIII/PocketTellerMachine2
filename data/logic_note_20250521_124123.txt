Subject: Logic Strategy Note 

Dear Team,

We have experienced a substantial fluctuation in trading performance over the last few quarters. While this can, and does, happen in our industry, our main aim is to implement a more rigorous and strategic approach to our trading practices. This logic strategy note should serve as a tool to improve our decision-making process and create a more disciplined trading environment.

Here are the key points of our logic strategy:

1. **Objective Analysis:** Before making any trading decisions, we must undertake a thorough and objective analysis of the market conditions and the potential risks and rewards. Identify the key indicators, trends, and market influencers that will shape our decisions regarding when and what to trade.

2. **Risk Management:** It is crucial to implement stringent risk management practices. Each trade should entail a clear understanding of the potential downside. We should only engage with trades where we are comfortable with the level of risk involved. 

3. **Consistency and Discipline:** In trading, consistency and discipline can often be more significant than short-term gains. Setting focused trading goals and sticking to the established strategy, regardless of market fluctuations, is vital.

4. **Emotionless Trading:** It is essential to eliminate emotions from our trading decisions. Trading based on fear or greed can lead to poor decision-making, inconsistency, and unnecessary risk. 

5. **Regular Reviews:** Market conditions, trading performance, and strategy effectiveness should be regularly reviewed. This practice will help us improve and adjust our strategies, keeping us in the best position for changes in the market environment.

6. **Continuous Learning:** The financial markets are constantly evolving. Continued learning and staying up-to-date with global trends and changes affecting the markets must be a part of our strategy. 

Our aim with this strategy is to have a disciplined approach to trading, making decisions based on research and analysis rather than instinct or emotion. This approach should result in more consistent returns and a stronger, more robust trading operation.

Let's continue to communicate and collaborate as we adopt this strategy.

Best,
