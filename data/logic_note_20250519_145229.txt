Subject: Logic Strategy for Trading Activities 

Dear Team, 

The purpose of this note is to outline our strategy moving forward, based on logical considerations of the market trends, economic conditions and trading goals in line with a risk-controlled environment. 

1. **Market Analysis:** Regularly analyze global market trends. Consistent study of market trends allows us to identify opportunities and make informed decisions. 

2. **Risk Management:** Implement rigorous risk controls. Assessing potential risks of every trade and setting stop-loss orders can prevent us from significant losses.

3. **Diversification:** Invest in different types of assets. Over-focusing on a single, narrow category can create unnecessary risk. 

4. **Temporal Spread:** Let’s not pour all our funds in one trade call. Timing the market is almost impossible, hence it's better to spread our investments over time. 

5. **Consistent Review:** Regular review of our trading strategies and performance. This would help us make necessary adjustments and evolve according to the market’s dynamics. 

6. **Emotional Control:** Prevent making trading decisions based on emotions. Logical and well-reasoned decision making is the foundation of successful trading. 

7. **Quality vs Quantity:** Do not chase every perceived opportunity. It's important to focus on trades with higher chances of success than constantly trading on every potential movement. 

8. **Learning** Plan: Keep educating ourselves about the market. It's important to be open-minded and continue learning new methods and strategies. 

At last, let's remember, the value of logic and reason cannot be overstated in the world of trading. It is the cornerstone of creating a successful and sustainable trading strategy. 

Best, 
[Your Name]
