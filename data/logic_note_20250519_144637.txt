Subject: Strategic Note: Trading Plan

Dear Cole,

I hope this message finds you well. As your trading assistant, I am furnishing this note to outline our strategic planning for our trading activities. Our approach involves a logical, calculated methodology designed to maximize profits while minimizing risk.

1. Thorough Market Research: Insightful and ongoing analysis of market trends, economic indicators, and geopolitical events that may impact our investments.

2. Risk Management: An effective plan for managing risks is integral. Aim to never risk more than a predefined percentage of the portfolio on a single trade. Establishing stop-loss orders can also protect against unexpected market downturns.

3. Diversification: Also known as not putting all your eggs in one basket. We spread our investments across various sectors, asset classes, and geographical locations to cushion any potential market volatility.

4. Strict Adherence to our Trading Plan: Develop a well-articulated trading plan and stick with it, adjusting only when clear trends or concrete information necessitates a change.

5. Constant Monitoring and Review: Regularly review our investment portfolios - praising the performing ones and re-strategizing the non-performing ones. 

6.Emphasizing on Quality over Quantity: Itâ€™s not about the number of trades but about how profitable each trade is. We must prioritize value quality trades over numerous mediocre ones.

7. Emotion Check: We need to maintain a disciplined and objective approach in trading, refraining from decisions driven by greed or panicking over market fluctuations. 

8. Utilizing Technology: Use of advanced trading tools and analytics software can lead to better decision-making, improving our trading efficiency.

9. Learning and Adaptness: Trading strategy isn't static. We must continue learning, adapting to new market conditions, and refining our strategy accordingly.

Remember, it's not about winning every trade, it's about being profitable in the long run. I look forward to your feedback on this strategy and I'm at your disposal for further clarifications.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

Trading Assistant to Mr. Cole.
