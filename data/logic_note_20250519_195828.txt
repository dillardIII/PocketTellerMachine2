Subject: Key Logic Trading Strategy Update

Dear Cole,

I am writing to provide an update on our current logic trading strategy. Itâ€™s important to be cognizant of our trading approach to maximize the potential for success.

1. Market Analysis: Our trading day should commence by analyzing the overnight news or events that may affect the market. This information will help understand the market sentiment and decide which stocks, currencies, commodities, or indexes are worth focusing on for the day.

2. Trend Identification: We adhere to the philosophy "Trend is your Friend". Identify if the market is trending or swinging and pick stocks accordingly. Consider both long-term (across several months) and short-term (daily or weekly) trends.

3. Risk Management: Ensure setting appropriate stop-loss and take-profit orders on every trade to minimize potential losses and maximize profits. Consider using a 2:1 risk/reward ratio as a general standard.

4. Portfolio Diversification: Keep our portfolio diversified across various industries and asset classes to further shield from potential risks.

5.UIntegration of Fundamental and Technical Analysis: It is imperative that we integrate both fundamental and technical analysis into our decision-making process. Fundamental analysis aids in identifying undervalued or overhyped securities, while technical analysis assists in timing the entries and exits accurately.

6. Emotion Control: Trading decisions must be based on concrete data and logical analysis, not driven by emotions. We should maintain discipline and patience, and avoid impulsive trades.

7. Regular Review of Strategy: Finally, conduct regular reviews of our trading strategy to scrutinize its performance, rectify mistakes and make necessary tweaks.

This logic-based trading strategy is drafted to optimize our investment decisions and increase the probability of profitable trades. Feel free to share any thoughts or suggestions you might have, as we value both collaboration and flexibility in this important approach.

Kind Regards,
