Subject: Logic Trading Strategy Note

Dear Colleague,

Understanding the current trading market and fluctuations is crucial to ensure our investments perform well. Here is a logical investment plan that may help keep our trading more organised and efficient:

1. Diversification: This is a fundamental logic in any trading strategy to mitigate potential risks. Diversify our stocks and bonds between various industries and sectors. This way, even if one industry faces a downturn, others may help prop up our portfolio.

2. Regular Market Analysis: Keep pace with market trends, global events and financial news, validating the logic of investment decisions. 

3. Long-Term Investment: Logic holds that long-term investments generally yield better returns than short-term speculation. Consider equities that have a reputation for consistent growth over the years, even if the short-term projections look anemic.

4. Understanding Risk Tolerance: Continuing with logical strategy, understand the extent of risk we can afford to take. This should be undertaken according to the capital we possess and also the financial goals.

5. Investing in what we Know: While choosing a company to invest in, ensure to have a comprehensive understanding about the organization, the leadership, the business model, and its competitive standing in the industry.

6. Detailed Record Keeping: Keeping a detailed track and taking note of our trades will assist us in making future decisions. By using our past experiences, we can avoid making the same mistakes in the future.

7. Exit Strategy: When an investment rises or falls to a predetermined price stated in our strategy, it should trigger us to sell as per our risk tolerance.

8. Regular Portfolio Review: Keep a regular check on our performance. This helps us understand where our strategy may be succeeding or potentially lacking.

9. Rebalancing Portfolio: Maintain our level of risk tolerance. If one group of investments is doing significantly better than another, it might be time to rebalance our portfolio.

10. Patience: Above all, logic dictates trading is not a get-rich-quick scheme. Patience is key to trading success.

Remember that every trading opportunity presents different potential rewards and each comes with its own risks. Be logical, strategic, and patient when deciding to trade.
