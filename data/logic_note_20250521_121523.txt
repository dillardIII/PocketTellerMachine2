Subject: Logic Strategy Note for Trading

Dear Cole,

In order to enhance trading performance, we need to adopt a systematic approach and make practically sound choices. Here's a logic strategy that aligns with our trading objectives:

1. **Market Analysis**: Our fundamental analysis will be driven by macroeconomic indicators (GDP, Employment figures, Interest Rates, Inflation etc.), sectoral trends, and geopolitical events. Technical analysis should be used to understand short-term price movements and trends, applying tools such as moving averages, relative strength index, and Fibonacci retracements.

2. **Risk Management**: We must establish a robust risk management strategy and ensure that each trade we carry out entails a risk-to-reward ratio that aligns with our risk tolerance. Limiting our losses is as critical as making profits. Utilize stop-loss and take-profit points to control losses and lock-in profits respectively.

3. **Position Sizing**: By diversifying portfolio, we can mitigate risks and improve potential for return. Each trade should be a small, calculated percentage of our trading capital to avoid any substantial losses from a single trade.

4. **Trading Discipline**: Stay disciplined and trade based on your strategy and not emotions. Do not deviate from the planned strategy, and always only base decisions on factual and experienced market and business information.

5. **Performance Review**: Regularly review and analyze our trades to understand our success and failures. This will help us refine our strategies and optimize the profits.

6. **Timing**: The timing of entering and exiting a trade is crucial. Optimal time to trade depends on liquidity, volatility and the trading strategy in place. 

7. **Continuing Education**: The financial market is dynamic, and it poses a continuous learning scope. By keeping up to date with market news, financial innovations, and trading tools, we can stay ahead and adapt our trading strategies accordingly.

Remember, the main goal is to consistently execute this trading strategy, without letting emotions drive our decisions.
