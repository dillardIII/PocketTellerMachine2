Subject: Logic Strategy - Trading Notes 

1. Market Analysis: The critical first step in any trading strategy is to analyze the current market trends, including both international and local markets. Review economic indicators, expert analysis, and forecasts to understand the market's direction. 

2. Risk Management: Each trade comes with a certain level of risk. Setting stop losses, diversifying portfolio, and investing only what we can afford to lose can help manage this risk. It is crucial to avoid letting emotions influence our trading decisions.

3. Sector Surveillance: Monitor the sectors that align with our trading goals. Identify the sectors gaining momentum or experiencing downturns to find promising trade opportunities.

4. Position Sizing: Never put all eggs in one basket. Position sizing helps to manage risk by limiting the size of the trade relative to the total trading account size. The most accepted strategy is to commit a small percentage of trading capital to each trade.

5. Continuous Learning: The market is a dynamic entity; it's ever-evolving. Constantly updating our knowledge-base, for instance, understanding new financial instruments, rules & regulations, tax implications, etc., is key for long-term trading success. 

6. Plan Trades: A well-laid-out trading plan should include the objective, the desired rate of return, the risk tolerance level, and the evaluation criteria or benchmarks. This will allow to tailor our trading activity to meet personal investment goals.

7. Regular Review: A periodic review of both the market scenario and our trading portfolio is a must. This helps in identifying potential issues, opportunities to readjust our investments, and if needed, exit a position.

8. Utilize Technology: Leverage advanced trading systems for automation and creating alerts that can help in better decision-making.

9. Patience: Patience is key in trading. Always wait for opportunities where high probabilities lie. Avoid jumping into trades out of boredom or for the sake of having an open position.

10. Flexibility: We have to be flexible in applying different strategies for different market conditions - bullish, bearish, or sideways.

Please bear in mind, as trading associates, our ultimate goal is to maximize profit and minimize risk. Itâ€™s crucial to stay focused, improvise as necessary, and learn from mistakes to continually evolve our trading strategy.
