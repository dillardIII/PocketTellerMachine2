Sure, I can help you with that. However, I need more specific details about what the "Momentum Screener Bot" should do. 

For instance, are we screening stocks for momentum? If so, what are the criteria for momentum? Are we using a specific API to gather stock data? 

Here's a basic example of how you might set up a momentum screener bot for stocks using the yfinance library to download stock data:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

def calculate_momentum(data, period):
    return data['Close'].diff(period) / data['Close'].shift(period)

def momentum_screener(tickers, period):
    momentum_data = {}
    for ticker in tickers:
        data = yf.download(ticker)
        momentum = calculate_momentum(data, period)
        momentum_data[ticker] = momentum
    return momentum_data

tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL']
momentum_data = momentum_screener(tickers, 14)

# Now, you can filter stocks based on momentum
# For example, let's filter stocks with positive momentum
positive_momentum_stocks = {ticker: momentum for ticker, momentum in momentum_data.items() if momentum[-1] > 0}

print(positive_momentum_stocks)
```

This code calculates the momentum of a stock as the percentage change in its closing price over a given period. It then screens a list of tickers for stocks with positive momentum.

Please provide more specific details if you want a different implementation.
