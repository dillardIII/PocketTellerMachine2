Subject: Logic Strategy Note 

Dear Cole,

As your trading assistant, I recommend we deploy the following logic-based strategy towards our trading operations.

1. **Diversification**: Don't put all our eggs in one basket to avoid risks. It's important to spread your investments across a variety of different assets.

2. **Fundamental Analysis**: It focuses on creating a picture of a company, along with assessing its present status and quantitatively forecasting its future potential.

3. **Technical Analysis**: This refers to the practice of predicting the price or volume trends of a security with the help of historical market data. We can utilize this tool to predict future market performance.

4. **Risk Tolerance**: We need to evaluate our risk tolerance capacity. While high-risk investments can result in significant returns, they may also lead to substantial losses.

5. **Market Trends**: Look for long-term trends in the market. They might be positive (upwards), negative (downwards), or even sideways. 

6. **Position Sizing**: We need to calculate the amount we should invest in each asset carefully to ensure maximum profitability while staying within our risk tolerance.

7. **Stop-Loss Orders**: It's crucial to set a stop-loss order to ensure we won't suffer from huge losses. A selling price is set, and if the stocks fall below that price, they will be sold automatically.

8. **Review and Adjust**: The strategy should be flexible enough to adjust itself based on the market changes. Regularly review market trends and asset portfolio.

9. **Learning**: Always stay open to learning. Investment in knowledge about new assets, trends, or trading strategies can provide us with an upper hand in the market.

10. **Patience**: Patience is key in trading. Sometimes, it's better to hold onto certain assets for better returns in the future than to sell them now for minimal profit.

By implementing these strategic logic steps, we can optimise our trading performance, minimise risk, and maximise profitability.
