Title: Trading Logic Strategy for Optimal Results 

1. Detailed Market Research: 
To have an edge in the trading business, deep and comprehensive market analysis is essential. Understand the market trends, competitors, and variables that affect prices. Use qualitative and quantitative data to make informed decisions. 

2. Risk Management: 
Always have a risk management plan in place. Determine the amount of risk per trade, daily loss limit, maximum losses and win goal for each trade. 

3. Stop Loss and Take Profit Orders: 
These are two key elements in trading strategy. Set up appropriate stop-loss levels to protect your investment from significant losses. At the same time, implement take-profit levels to ensure profits are realized at the optimal moment.

4. Use the Right Tools: 
Leverage trading tools available in your platform such as trading signals, economic calendar, market analysis, etc. These tools, when used correctly, can give insights which in turn can significantly influence your trading decisions. 

5. Disciplined Approach: 
Stick to your plan and be consistent. Don't let emotions drive your decisions. Emphasize on making grounded decisions based on market analysis and forecasts. 

6. Diversification: 
Don't just put all your investments into one market, but rather spread them across different markets. This would minimize the risk and increase the potential for higher returns.

7. Regular Evaluation and Adjustment: 
Trading strategies should not remain static. The effectiveness of the strategy should be regularly evaluated and adjusted according to changing market conditions and other factors. 

8. Continuous Learning: 
Stay updated with latest trends and techniques in the trading industry. Further refine your strategic financial skills and understanding of markets by taking advantage of various education resources.

Remember, a well-crafted trading strategy is one that is clearly defined, rigorously tested, and consistently applied. With this approach, we will be well-positioned for success in this volatile yet rewarding business.
