Subject: Logic Strategy Development for Efficient Trading 

Dear Cole,

As your trading assistant, I would recommend the following logic strategy to improve efficacy and profitability in our trading operations:

1. **Comprehensive Research & Analysis**: The backbone of any trading strategy is thoroughly understanding the market. Stay informed with global news, industry trends, and historical trading data.

2. **Diversification Strategy**: Distribute investments among various financial instruments, industries, and other categories to minimize potential risks. Emergencies or unforeseen market events that affect one sector or investment type may not have the same impact on others.

3. **Risk Management**: Define the maximum percentage of the total trading capital you are ready to risk in a single trade. A common approach is one to two percent. This helps to limit any potential fallout from a bad trade.

4. **Price Action Strategy**: Price actions and trends should form the basis of our trading decisions instead of depending excessively on technical indicators. Momentum in price movements often indicate ongoing trends that can be beneficial to us. 

5. **Consistent Review**: Portfolio should be reviewed on a regular basis and adjustments made based on performance and market conditions. 

6. **Avoid Emotional Trading**: Decisions should not be based on fear or greed. Itâ€™s easy to get swept up in the excitement or nervousness of the stock market, but these emotions can often lead to poor decisions.

7. **Use of Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Points**: Always identify the stop-loss and take-profit points to manage risks, just before making a trade. This requires good judgement and knowledge of the markets.

8. **Maintaining Trading Discipline**: Strategies are worthless without discipline. Stick to your plan and maintain consistency.

9. **Align Strategy with Goals and Trading Style**: Our trading strategies must align with our long-term financial goals and suit your trading style. 

10. **Keep Learning**: The trading market is dynamic and it is important to keep learning and adapting to new strategies and situations.

I am confident that with these trading strategies, we can make better trading decisions and increase profitability, while decreasing potential risks.

Best Wishes,
