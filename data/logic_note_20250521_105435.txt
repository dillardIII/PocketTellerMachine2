Subject: Forward Strategy for Trading Activities in Q2

1. Diversification: Continue investing in a diversified portfolio to spread the risk. This includes investing in different sectors, i.e., technology, healthcare, financial services, and various types of investments, including stocks, bonds, and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).

2. RoB (Research over Bias): Base all investment decisions on comprehensive research rather than personal or market bias. Thoroughly investigate and understand each opportunity, its risks, and returns.

3. Sustainable Investment: Focus more on ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance) investing as these companies tend to have stronger long-term prospects.

4. Track Global Trends: Consider global macroeconomic trends to identify potential opportunities and threats. The aftershocks of COVID-19, inflation, and interest rates are critical factors to monitor.

5. Hedging: Incorporate a hedging strategy to safeguard our portfolio against unforeseen market downturns. 

6. Rebalancing: Regularly re-evaluate and rebalance the portfolio to keep it aligned with our intended asset allocation and risk tolerance.

7. Emphasis on Blue-Chip Stocks: Continue emphasizing our investment in blue-chip stocks with a steady history of good returns to reduce exposure to high volatility stocks.

8. Risk Management: Closely monitor risk parameters and abide by stop-loss orders to mitigate potential losses.

9. Technological Integration: Utilize fintech tools to analyze vast quantities of data for better insight and decision-making. 

10. Constant Learning: Stay updated with financial news and attend trading seminars/webinars to ensure we're using the best, most up-to-date strategies. 

As we implement this strategy, our principle is to balance risk and return wisely while remaining flexible to adapt to the ever-fluctuating market conditions.

Stay focused, diligent, and forward-thinking!
