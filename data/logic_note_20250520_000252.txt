Subject: Logic Strategy Note 

Dear Cole, 

Following our earlier discussion to create a logic strategy as a guide for our trading approach, it's paramount that we root our decisions in careful analysis and strategic thinking. Below is the proposed logic strategy:

1. **Fundamental Analysis:** Always conduct a robust evaluation of financial statements, industry trends, macroeconomic indicators, and political influences. This thorough analysis will give us a clear insight into the health of the company or commodity and an idea of their potential growth trajectory or risks.

2. **Technical Analysis:** We use historical price data and statistical tools to predict likely movements. Regularly examine trading volumes and price charts to identify trends and price patterns which can give us an edge.

3. **Buy Low, Sell High:** This core strategy emphasizes buying securities when their prices are down and selling them when their prices rise. The aim is to follow the trend of a security's price but act contrary when we have a strong belief the trend will shortly reverse.

4. **Diversify the Portfolio:** To manage risk, a diversified portfolio comprised of different asset classes, industries, and geographical regions is crucial. Diversification lowers investment risk by spreading the risk across various securities.

5. **Risk Management:** Always set a stop-loss order on all trade actions. This will guard against significant losses and ensure the longevity of our trading activities. 

6. **Manage Leverage:** While leverage can magnify profits, it can also magnify losses. It must be used wisely, considering other factors such as the volatility of the assets.

7. **Regular Review:** Conduct periodic reviews and performance assessments of all trading activities. This helps to keep us accountable, recognize trends, and adjust strategies as necessary.

8. **Patience and Discipline:** The market can be unpredictable, patience, discipline, and a strict adherence to our strategy are crucial to avoid making impulsive decisions that can cost us dearly.

9. **Learning and Adapting:** Market conditions are always changing. Continuous learning and adapting our strategies are key to remain relevant in the ever-dynamic trading environment.

10. **Emotions Control:** Never let emotions dictate trading decisions. Fear and greed can lead to poor decisions, stick to predefined strategies and systems. 

Remember, there is no 'sure thing' in trading. Our focus should be to make well-calculated decisions that offer a good risk to reward ratio.
