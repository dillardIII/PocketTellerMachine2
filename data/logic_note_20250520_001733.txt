Subject: Logic Strategy Note 

Dear Team,

As we maneuver through the unpredictable trends of the trading landscape, it's crucial that our trading strategies are rooted in sound reasoning and coherence. Below is our logic strategy which will guide our present and future trading decisions:

1. **Clear Objectives**: Before initiating any trade, state clear, realistic, and measurable objectives. This would not just mean profit objectives but also include risk tolerance levels.  

2. **Data Analysis**: Use logic- and evidence-based methods to analyze the market. This should include the study of key market indicators, the appraisal of market volatility, and recognition of trends or patterns. We encourage the use of both technical and fundamental analysis.

3. **Diversification**: No trade is without risk. By diversifying our portfolio, we can protect against volatility in any one investment. This requires a logical assessment of all asset classes and time horizons. 

4. **Consistency**: Reacting to market movements caused by news or events without the validation of data analysis can result in making trades based on emotions. Remain consisten with the logic parameters we set.

5. **Risk Management**: Always identify the potential downside for every trade to limit any unexpected losses. The 'Stop-Loss' and 'Take Profit' levels should be identified logically before placing the trade.

6. **Evaluation**: Post-trade analysis is vital. It offers a learning opportunity, helps to tweak strategies, and enhances trading logic for future decisions. Analyzing what went well and what didn't go planned needs to be incorporated into our trading process.

Our logic trading strategy is a dynamic process and may require adjustments according to changes in market dynamics, economic situations, or investment goals. Remember, logic prevails over emotions in the trading world. Let's demonstrate discipline, strategic thinking, and enlightened decision-making in our trades.

Best regards,
