Title: Effective Logical Trading Strategy for Cole's Investments 

Objective: To maximize profitability and minimize risk exposure by implementing a smart, logic-based trading strategy. 

Strategy:

1. Fundamental Analysis: It's essential to determine the intrinsic value of an investment. Analyze earnings, revenue, assets, cash flow, management effectiveness, and economic conditions.

2. Technical Analysis: Utilize graphs and statistical trends to analyze past market behavior and identify promising trading opportunities. Examine price movements, trading volumes, momentum indicators, price and volume oscillators, trend and support/resistance lines.

3. Diversification: Maintain a diversified portfolio across multiple asset classes (stocks, commodities, real estate, etc.) and geographies to mitigate volatility risk.

4. Risk Management: Identify and quantify potential risks for each trade. Set an acceptable risk/reward ratio and use stop-loss orders to limit losses and protect profits. 

5. Regular Monitoring: Track the portfolio's performance regularly and adjust the strategy based on changes in market conditions, economic trends, or investment performance. 

6. Patient Approach: Aim for long-term returns rather than short-term gains. Time in the market typically outperforms timing the market.

7. Discipline: Develop a trading plan and stick to it. Avoid impulsive decisions based on fear, greed, or market rumors. Make decisions based on analytical factors and logic.

8. Continuous Learning: Stay updated with the latest market trends and economic news. Attend seminars, webinars, and read trading literature regularly.

Conclusion: The objective of this logical trading strategy is not only to achieve profitable returns, but to do so in a disciplined and risk-averse manner. Patience, discipline, and strategic diversification are key to trading success over the long term. Markets can be unpredictable, and thus, having a concrete plan can help navigate through volatility while capitalizing on opportunities.
