Subject: Logic Strategy Plan for Cole's Trading 

Dear [Recipient's name],

I hope this message finds you well. We are constantly seeking to improve our trading approach and ensure our strategies are not only efficient, but also logical, coherent and profitable. Here's the strategic plan of action that we suggest:

1. Prioritizing Market Research: 
    Extensive and thorough market research is at the very core of our trading strategy. Understanding market trends, sectoral shifts, geopolitical risks and economic indicators will assist us in making logical and informed decisions.

2. Utilizing Technical Analysis: 
    We'll use tools and techniques of technical analysis like chart patterns, trendlines, and indicators. These will provide us insight into potential market movements and help us predict price trends logically.

3. Focusing on Risk Management: 
    Prudent risk management will continue to be a significant part of our trading strategy. We'll consider risk/reward ratio to safeguard our capital and use stop-loss orders to limit our potential losses.

4. Diversification of Portfolio: 
    To balance the risk of unexpected market movements, we will diversify our portfolio across various sectors and financial instruments.

5. Consistent Review and Evaluation: 
    To ensure the continued logic and efficiency of our strategies, regular reviews and evaluations of our trading performance is crucial. This will help us understand what is working and what needs improvements.

6. Professional Development: 
    Given the dynamic nature of markets, continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trading strategies, theories and regulations is essential. 

7. Emotion-Free Trading: 
    Ultimately, success in trading largely depends on making decisions based on logic and not emotions. Removing emotional biases will prevent impulsive decisions, leading to a more methodical and organized trading strategy.

The above strategic pointers form the core foundation of our trading approach and are designed to maximize potential returns and minimize risks in a systematic manner. Please feel free to suggest any alterations or additions as you see fit. 

Looking forward to your feedback.
