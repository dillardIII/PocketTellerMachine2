Subject: Logic Trading Strategy 

Dear Cole,

I hope this message finds you well. The purpose of this note is to develop a logical trading strategy that emphasizes risk management, considers macroeconomic factors, adopts several analytical strategies and follows a disciplined approach. 

1. **Proper Risk Management**:
Always decide in advance how much you are willing to risk on an investment. Never risk more than 2% of your trading capital. This will protect you from significant downturns and keep you in the trading game for an extended period.

2. **Diversification**:
One of the key ways to mitigate risk is by diversification. Putting your investments into different kinds of assets can help ensure that a poor performance from a single investment does not have a disastrous effect on your overall portfolio.

3. **Consistent Analysis**: 
Regularly analyse your trades to identify patterns and implement continuous improvement. Use both fundamental and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis involves reviewing companyâ€™s financials and its strategic positioning in the market. Technical analysis involves price patterns, volume of trades etc.

4. **Trade with Trend**:
While 'contrarian' trading can be profitable, trading with the prevailing market trend increases your chances of success in the long run. Identify your trading time-frame and observe the trends accordingly. 

5. **Discipline is Key**: 
Frequent trading can often lead to quick burnout and capital erosion. Set well-considered stop loss and profit targets and adhere to them.

6. **Macro-economic factors**:
Always keep an eye on larger economic trends such as inflation, interest rates and economic growth. They can often influence the market direction.

7. **Do not over-leverage**: 
Even though leverage can multiply the profits, it similarly amplifies the losses. Therefore, use leverage cautiously, if at all.

8. **Trading Plan**:
Have a pre-determined trading strategy that includes which investments to make, when to exit, how much to risk and when to book profits. One must strictly adhere to this plan and avoid making decisions based on emotions.

The most successful traders are always planning and analysing. To succeed in this highly competitive field, you must also do the same. Keep a regular schedule for analysing your trades, strategizing your investments, and reading up on market news.
