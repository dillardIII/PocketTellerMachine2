Subject: Strategic Approach towards Improved Trading Performance

Dear Cole,

There has been significant developments in the trading market that may have a large impact on your trading portfolio. Therefore, we should discuss some logical tactics and strategies which may help you to improve your overall trading performance.

1. Market Analysis: Regularly performing both technical and fundamental analysis is essential. Technical analysis will help you to identify the market trends, while fundamental analysis aids in understanding the intrinsic value of the assets. 

2. Diversification: In order to diminish risk, consider broadening your portfolio across various asset classes. A diverse portfolio can offer a cushion against market turbulence.

3. Risk Management: Always consider setting a risk/reward ratio before starting any trade. This will protect your trading from heavy losses. 

4. Appropriate Use of Leverage: While it may be tempting to use high leverage, this technique should be used judiciously. Each trade should only use a small percentage of your trading capital.

5. Automated Trading: Look into algorithmic trading software. They can execute trades for you based on a pre-set strategy, freeing up your resources and time, yet monitoring is still mandatory partially to avoid any anomalies the algorithm might have.

6. Regular Portfolio Review: Frequently assessing your portfolio can help you to understand the effectiveness of your strategies. This could also help in making crucial adjustments to your existing plan. 

7. Keeping Up-to-Date: Be aware of financial news and events in the market. These can often lead to drastic changes in the market, and being aware beforehand could help to make necessary modifications. 

8. Stick to Your Plan: Market fluctuations may push you to make impulsive decisions. However, it is pivotal to have faith in your strategic planning and avoid making decisions based on emotions.

9. Long-Term Vision: Maintain a long-term vision rather than focusing on short-term profits or losses. Patience, discipline, and persistence can often provide more fruitful results.

Remember, the goal is to maximize profit and minimize loss, and drafting a strategic approach could be a pathway leading to an improved trading style.
