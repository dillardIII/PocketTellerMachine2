Subject: Trading Strategy Note 

Objective: 
Our main objective is to maximize returns, minimize risk and ensure a diverse and balanced portfolio. 

Strategy: 

1. Enhanced Fundamental Analysis: Thoroughly analyze both from macro and micro perspective i.e. financial, political, and economical sectors in order to make educated trading decisions. 

2. Diversify Portfolios: Spread investments across a wide variety of assets - stocks, commodities, bonds, ETFs, etc. This will help minimize potential losses if one investment is damaged due to macroeconomic or sector-specific downturns.

3. Emphasizing on Risk Management: All trades should adhere to the principle of risk-return trade off. Implement stop-loss measures and always calculate the downside risk before placing any trades.

4. Adapt to Market Volatility: Volatility is not always bad. Use it to advantage by investing in distressed assets, short term trading, and asset allocation revision.

5. Implement Dollar-Cost Averaging: Continual investing in a particular asset, regardless of the fluctuation in price at which the asset trades, will over time, reduce the average pay-per-share, allowing us to achieve a lower average cost per share.

6. Regularly Monitor and Rebalance Portfolio: Regularly revise the allocation of assets in the portfolio, and rebalance them to ensure they still comply with their initially targeted strategic asset allocation.

Action plan: 

1. Back-test trading strategies using historical data
2. Identify market trends and viable investment opportunities through quantitative research 
3. Stay updated on market news and adjust trading strategies accordingly 
4. Weekly review and rebalance of portfolio 

Overall, our approach should remain strategic, proactive and flexible, changing according to market conditions with a keen eye on risk. This strategy is intended to preserve capital while achieving a steady growth in investment returns.
