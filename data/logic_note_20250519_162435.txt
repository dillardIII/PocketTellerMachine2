Subject: Logic Trading Strategy 

Dear Team,

In order for us to strive for maximum profitability and limited risks while trading, our logic trading strategy will focus on the following key areas:

1. Diversification: To successfully manage risk, we'll diversify our portfolio across various asset classes such as stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies from different industries and geographic locations. 

2. Fundamental Analysis: We'll rely on fundamental analysis in all our operations. That means analyzing financial statements, industry trends, GDP levels, inflation rates, interest rates and other macroeconomic factors to arrive at a stockâ€™s intrinsic value.

3. Technical Analysis: Besides fundamental factors, we'll also use technical analysing tools like moving averages, trend lines, support and resistance levels, to evaluate future price movements.

4. Sentiment Analysis: Monitoring market sentiment, including investor psychology and trader sentiment, will be crucial to our approach.

5. Risk Management: We'll use stop-loss orders and take-profit orders to manage our risk and ensure we're not adversely affected by significant market movements. Additionally, we will only risk a small percentage of our capital on a single trade.

6. Regular Reviews: We'll review our portfolio on an ongoing basis. This proactive approach will allow us to take advantage of emerging opportunities and guard against potential vulnerabilities.

7. Continuous Learning: Education will be a backbone to our strategy. We'll continue to learn about new trading techniques, economic indicators, and insights to stay relevant and informed about the developments in the market.

In conclusion, our logical trading strategy will be a combination of objective analysis, disciplined risk management, continuous learning and agile response to market changes. With this strategy, we aim to ensure our trading provides positive returns and aligns with our larger business goals.

Thank you,

[Your Name]
