Title: Comprehensive Strategy for Effective Trading

1. **Identifying Goals**: Defining our trading objectives is the first step in formulating our strategy. The goals should be both achievable and measurable so we can track our progress. 

2. **Developing Risk Management Plans**: Trading involves significant risks. It's crucial for us to set our risk tolerance level and incorporate it into our strategy. This could involve setting stop losses, diversifying the portfolio, hedging, etc.

3. **Research & Analysis**: This involves studying the market trends, keeping ourselves updated with global economic events that may influence the market, and performing regular technical and fundamental analysis to forecast price movements. 

4. **Selecting Appropriate Trading Instruments**: It's crucial to choose the right trading tools that align with our objectives. Whether its forex, commodities, indices, or equities- we must have a clear understanding of their workings.

5. **Asset Allocation & Diversification**: Spreading out investments across different asset classes can significantly reduce risks and increase chances of returns. 

6. **Regular Monitoring & Reviewing**: Keep track of market trends, news events and regularly review our trading strategy based on these. The market is dynamic, our trading strategy should be too.

7. **Self-discipline**: Patience, objectivity and consistency are key to successful trading. Emotional trading often leads to hasty decisions. 

This strategic approach supports us to meet our trading objectives efficiently while effectively managing trading risks. Remember, the objective is not to win every trade, but to have a net positive outcome through consistent gains and effective management of losses.
