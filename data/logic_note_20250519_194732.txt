Subject: Logic Trading Strategy Note

Dear Cole, 

In our pursuit for consistent and profitable trading, I have outlined a logical, data-driven strategy that we should consider:

1. **Market Analysis**: Understand and analyse the broad market trends before we make any trade. Our trading decisions should mirror the sentiments of the market. 

2. **Asset Selection**: Diversification is key. We should opt for a mix of assets â€“ stocks, bonds, commodities, and forex. This way, any unfavourable activity in a particular asset class could be counterbalanced by the performance of another.

3. **Price Movement Identification**: Use technical analysis tools to gather information from historical price and volume data. Identify key price levels and potential market direction to guide our trading execution.

4. **Risk Management**: Strict risk management techniques should be applied to each trade. Limit losses through stop orders and define risk levels with risk/reward ratios. We ensure we have predefined exit points before entering any trade.

5. **Trading Discipline**: Maintain discipline by sticking to this strategy regardless of market fluctuations. It could be tempting to depart from the strategy during market highs or lows, but doing so will most likely turn back on us.

6. **Performance Review**: Regularly review the performance of our trades. Understand what is working, what isn't, and make necessary modifications. This will help us refine our strategy and improve decision-making.

Remember, the market is unpredictable and even the best trading strategies can go awry. The key is to stay consistent, patient, and strictly adhere to our trading plan. 

Looking forward to your thoughts on this.

Best,
