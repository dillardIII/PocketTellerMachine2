Subject: Enhancement of Trading Strategy: Preserving Capital & Maximising Returns 

Dear Team,

In order for us to continually manage Cole's trading activities effectively, it is vital that we adapt and apply an appropriate trading strategy. We recognize the need for a comprehensive approach that suits our current objectives and as such, I am putting forth logic strategies tailored to ensure sustainably healthy returns on our investments. Here are emphasized strategies pivoting around risk management, diversification, and capital optimization.

1. **Smart-Risk Management**: This approach focuses on the importance of managing risks judiciously to secure the worth of our capital. The implementation of stop-loss orders should be mandatory in each of our trading operations. Stop-loss orders safeguard our capital from potential drastic downturns.

2. **Consistent Diversification**: A diversified portfolio is an efficient method to decrease market risk. Our investment should not be concentrated in one or two areas, rather we should be spread across various sectors and asset classes. The asset allocation should be periodically reviewed and reset to its original mix when they begin to drift away from their target.

3. **Capital Optimization**: Investing in growth-oriented avenues can be productive. At the same time, we should also emphasize value investing, balancing our portfolio with a blend of both. High dividend-yielding stocks can also be considered for steady income and reinvestment opportunities. 

4. **Thorough Research & Analysis**: Each trading decision should be backed by diligent research and technical analysis. Favor assets with high profitability, low leverage, and consistent operational efficiency. Use data-driven insights for making informed decisions. 

5. **Long-Term Perspective**: While short-term fluctuations and timing the market can be compelling, investing from a long-term perspective often yields more consistent, profitable results. Maintain a balance between short-term and long-term investments.

6. **Emotional Discipline**: Maintain composure during volatile market situations. Trading decisions should never be dictated by fear or greed, but rather by careful analysis and sound reasoning.

Adherence to these strategies will require discipline and consistency. An effective trading strategy is not just about making profitable trades, but more importantly, it's about safeguarding and incrementally increasing our capital base. Let's incorporate these logic strategies into our everyday trading routine and work towards achieving sustained growth for Cole's trading outcomes.

Best Regards,
