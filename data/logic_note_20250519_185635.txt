Subject: Comprehensive Logic Strategy for Effective Trading

Dear Team,

Increased market volatility brings about new opportunities, but with these opportunities, come heightened risks. It is important to establish a trade strategy grounded in logic and objectivity as a disciplined approach will navigate us through unpredictable market scenarios. 

1. Diversify Portfolio: We should diversify our assets to spread and limit risk in a volatile market. Diffusing trades among different asset types like equities, bonds, and commodities can provide a buffer against losses. 

2. Research: Continuous market research is imperative. Stay updated on global news, economic indicators, scenarios affecting particular sectors, etc. The more knowledgeable we are about market conditions, the better prepared we'll be to configure our trading strategy.

3. Set Realistic Goals: The setting of realistic profit targets and risk/reward ratios should be a part of our strategy. Always aim for trades that can potentially yield more profit than loss.

4. Risk Management: We must acknowledge our risk tolerance and act accordingly, never risking more than a predetermined percentage of our portfolio on any single trade.

5. Analysis: Use fundamental and technical analysis for decision-making. Fundamental analysis can help us identify long-term value, while technical analysis can assist in recognizing trends and setting up entry/exit points.

6. Regular Monitoring: Stay vigilant with open trades. Markets can rapidly shift due to external factors, thus, regularly review and adjust positions as needed helps in mitigating losses. 

7. Contingency Plan: Establish stop and limit orders to automatically close trades at predetermined price levels. Such a tool serves as an effective strategy in mitigating potential loss.

8. Performance Tracking: Frequently analyse our trading performance. Identify strategies that work and those that don't. If a strategy is consistently failing, we must be ready to accept, learn, and adapt.

9. Emotional Restraint: Do not let emotions guide trading decisions. Stick to our plan, avoid impulsive decisions based on fear or greed.

10. Stay Informed: Engage in continuous learning. Attend webinars, workshops, and online courses to stay updated on new tools and strategies. 

Implementing logic-based strategies will assist us in reaching our trading goals, boosting our performance, and reducing inherent risks. Let's evaluate each trade logically, acting wisely rather than impulsively.

Kind Regards,
