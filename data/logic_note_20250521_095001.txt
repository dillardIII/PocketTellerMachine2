Subject: Logic Strategy for the Coming Trading Quarter

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. As we journey into a new trading quarter, it's essential that we adhere specifically to pre-devised logic strategies that will pioneer our investments, limit risks and increase liquidity.

1. Quality over quantity:
While it may be enticing to delve into multiple trades, we should focus more on the quality of trades rather than quantity. Concentrate on trades standing the best chance of success based on our meticulous analysis.

2. Regular Market Analysis: 
We need exhaustive intelligence on market trends. Keeping the focus on macroeconomic indicators, and geopolitical events will provide an understanding of the market's direction. Gathering information on a regular basis will keep us knowledgeable and ready for any market swings.

3. Risk Management:
No trade should risk more than 1% of our portfolio. By sticking to this principle, losses can be handled gracefully without majorly impacting the portfolio.

4. Diversification:
Donâ€™t focus on one particular asset; instead, spread the investment across different assets. This will distribute the risk and increase opportunities for returns.

5. Stick to Plans:
We use carefully conceived, data-backed plans for a reason. They reduce the chances of loss due to emotional or impulsive decisions. Stick to the plan unless there is a very compelling reason not to.

6. Continuous Learning: 
The trading market is constantly evolving; hence we must stay adaptable and remaining open to learning. Attending seminars, webinars, and training can hone our trading skills.

7. Use Technology:
Technology can make trading quicker, easier, and more reliable. Algorithmic trading, for instance, can help to automate trades, save time, and can execute the trade at the best possible price.

Remember, the market will always have its highs and lows. It's our strategy and logic that will dictate the course we sail and the rewards we reap.

Here's to a profitable quarter!

Regards,

[Your Name]
