Subject: Logic Strategy Development 

Dear Cole, 

For effective and profitable trading, it's important to have a clear logic strategy in place. Here are few strategies that could help:

1. **Discipline and Consistence**: Execute trades in a disciplined manner and maintain consistency in terms of trade times, position sizes and forecasting methods.

2. **Risk Management**: Identify the risk associated with every trade. It's advisable to risk no more than 2-5% of the total trading capital on any single trade.

3. **Art of Patience**: Wait for the right opportunities. Every trade won't be profitable, but with patience, we can capitalize on the profitable ones.

4. **Keep Emotions in Check**: Do not let a winning or losing trade affect decision-making process for the next trade.

5. **Research and Continuous Learning**: Develop a habit of learning by keeping track of market volatilities, economic factors and stay updated with latest trading strategies.

6. **Frequent Review**: Regularly review trade performances, aiming to learn from both profits and losses.

7. **Adapt and Modify**: Market conditions change frequently. Therefore, having a flexible strategy that can be modified as per changes is crucial.

8. **Diversification**: Diversification helps to spread the risk across different commodity types, sectors, or market trends.

9. **Stop Loss and Take Profit**: Predefine the stop loss and Take Profits level to minimize risk and protect profits.

10. **Different Market Condition**: Be ready with multiple strategies for different market conditions like bull market, bear market, wild market etc.

Remember, the idea is not to win every trade, but to make the winning trades profitable enough to cover the losses from the losing trades.
