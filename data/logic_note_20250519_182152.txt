Subject: Strategic Trading Plan Outline 

Dear Cole,

Given the evolving local and global economic climate, meticulous planning and shrewd decision-making have become vital. To that effect, I have devised a rough sketch of a few logical trading strategies that could benefit us in the forthcoming trades:

1. Diversification:
This will be our number one rule. We must diversify our portfolios across a range of assets, industries, and geographical locations to mitigate risk.

2. Regular Re-Balancing:
It is essential to regularly evaluate and adjust our portfolio to maintain our intended asset allocation. Rising stocks may be sold, and weaker ones may be bought - this is a way to ensure resistant investments.

3. Long-Term Goals:
Our strategy should emphasize long-term and achievable goals rather than rapid-fire trading based on market fluctuations. We should avoid knee-jerk reactions and stay committed to our goals.

4. Risk Management:
We must quantify and manage our accepted risk levels. We'll not focus solely on profit-making trades but also on protective trades to limit potential losses.

5. Liquidity Management:
Maintain a certain portion of the portfolio in liquid assets. This not only provides us with a safety net but also ensures that we have the necessary cash on hand for any opportunistic investments.

6. Technological Adaptation:
Embrace innovative trading technologies. This helps in faster and more accurate analysis of market trends thus enabling us to make data-driven decisions.

7. Constant Education:
We should educate ourselves continuously about market sentiment, geopolitical issues, and global economy which can directly or indirectly affect our trading decisions.

I'm confident that by embracing this logical trading strategy we will be better prepared to face the challenges of today's unpredictable trading environment. However, these are mere guidelines from which we can develop a more tailored plan that aligns with your specific investment goals.

Looking forward to discussing this in further detail.

Best Regards,
