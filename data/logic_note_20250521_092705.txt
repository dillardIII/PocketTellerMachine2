Subject: Strategic Plan for Trading and Investments for Cole 

Dear Cole,

Given our recent discussion, I have outlined a brief trading strategic note for your perusal. 

1. Kill Switch: When daily losses reach a certain, pre-specified level, our trading halts for the day to protect capital. This is our safety net to prevent excessive exposure due to downward spiraling.

2. Portfolio Diversification: Instead of piling up stocks from the same sector, we will diversify your portfolio across different sectors. This ensures a lower risk profile by mitigating sector-specific risks. 

3. Position Sizing: To ensure no single trade impacts the portfolio greatly, it's prudent to limit the maximum amount risked per trade to a small percentage of total capital.

4. Trend Adoption: Aiming to identify and follow the market trend. This could be done by analyzing economic indicators and company's financial health, instead of judging based on mere herd mentality.

5. Regular Rebalance: Regularly rebalancing your portfolio is crucial to maintain your desired level of risk. If one asset class outperforms others and becomes a higher percentage of portfolio than intended, we will sell it off and purchase assets in other sectors to rebalance.

6. Risk Management: Using stop losses and similar tools to minimize exposure to unexpected market shifts. This automation helps to escape the traps of emotional decision-making.

7. Fundamental Analysis: Continual research on each individual stock's inherent value is pivotal based on its financial health, industry position, and economic factors. This assists to make right decisions on what to add or remove from your portfolio.

8. Profit Booking Strategy: Setting Price targets for each investment to ensure we book profits regularly. A trailing stop order could be beneficial to lock the profit while letting it run as long as it's trending favorably.

9. Long-term Investments: Locating and investing in stocks that have potential for long-term success. Patience is beneficial in a market that oftentimes overvalues short-term gain.

10. Continuous Learning: Markets are volatile, so continuous learning and keeping up-to-date with world news and market changes is mandatory.

11. Tax Implications: Considering the tax efficiency of investment decisions remains a crucial part of the strategy. Implementing tools for tax-loss harvesting when applicable.

12. Regular Review Meetings: Semi-annual or quarterly reviews about your investment performance, rebalancing your portfolio and discussing your financial goals for the upcoming term. 

This proposed comprehensive strategy tries to balance between risk management and maximizing returns. Your feedback and any specific objectives or restrictions you might have can be incorporated to fine-tune the strategy.

Best,
