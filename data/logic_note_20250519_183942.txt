Subject: Logic Strategy in Trading

Dear Cole,

We have to ensure embodying a logic strategy in our market engagements to maximise profit and minimise risk. Below are the key points our strategy will focus on:

1. Planned Trades: We should predefine everything about our trades. This includes the where, when, and how. This way, we will be less inclined to make impulse decisions that could potentially lead to losses.

2. Risk Management: Always decide your potential loss before entering a trade. This should be a percentage of your total account balance. Ideally, we should only risk 1-2% of the entire portfolio on a single trade.

3. Market Analysis: Regularly inspect both fundamental and technical aspects of the market. These metrics will provide us with an insight into how the market is behaving, enabling us to plan our trades wisely.

4. Discipline: Our success lies in how well we stick to the plan. We should avoid emotion-driven decisions at all costs.

5. Continual Learning: The market is ever-changing and so should our strategies be. Let's dedicate a few hours each week to learn new market trends and tactics.

6. Portfolio Diversification: We must create a mixed portfolio with different types of investments. This way, even if one sector suffers, others might improve, bringing a balance to our portfolio.

Lastly, regular health-checks of our trading strategy must be conducted to ensure it is still profitable. If it isn't, it should be evaluated for what isn't working and updated accordingly.

Kind Regards,
