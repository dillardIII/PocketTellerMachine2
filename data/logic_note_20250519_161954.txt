Subject: Logic Strategy Note 

Dear Team,

As a consistent fuel to our trading approach, here is the logic strategy we will follow:

1. Establish Clear Goals: Know what we want from the trade. Understand our financial goals, time duration, and risk appetite. Make our decision-making process sharper.

2. Follow the Market Trend: Always align our actions with the market trend. Trend analysis will give us a good vision of market signals and hone our trading decisions.

3. Diversify: Don't put all our eggs in one basket. Spread our investments across different products to lessen the risk.

4. Regular Monitor: Review our investment portfolio regularly. Adapt our strategy with changing market scenarios. Be proactive in forecasting future trends.

5. Emphasis on Risk Management: Maintain a balance of risk and reward. Set stop-loss orders in place to limit prospective losses, without letting emotions control our decisions.

6. Fear and Greed: These two emotions are the biggest enemies of an investor. Do not let them guide our trading strategies. Make decisions based on the logic of statistics, data, and probabilistic reasoning.

7. Learning: Continuous learning and staying updated with market happenings is the key. Invest in gaining knowledge and understanding of market trends and strategies.

8. Be Patience: The stock market requires a surreal level of patience. Never rush. The market will always provide plenty of opportunities, but wait for an accurate moment to strike. Sometimes holding money is better than holding securities.

9. Entry and Exit: Have a clear plan for when to enter and when to exit. This helps to avoid making impulsive trades in panic situations. 

10. Discipline: Adherence to our trading strategy and discipline is critical. Following a systematic investment plan is crucial, without making exceptions unless absolutely necessary.

Let's keep these points in mind when we make our next trading decision.

Best,
[Your Name]
