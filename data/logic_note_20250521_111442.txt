Subject: Trading Strategy Note

Dear Cole,

In response to our recent discussions regarding the reconsideration of our trading approach, the following are strategic proposals intended to increase the effectiveness of our trading activities:

1. Risk Management: To lower potential losses, let's never risk more than 1-2% of our account balance on a single trade. This approach will sustain our account even in unforeseen market downturns.

2. Diversification: Spreading our investments across a variety of assets can minimize the impact if one asset performs unexceptionally poor. Diversity in portfolio can include different types of equities, fixed income securities, and commodities. 

3. Continuous Market Analysis: Engaging with both fundamental and technical analysis can drive us to make better trading decisions. Fundamental analysis includes evaluating a companyâ€™s financials, industry position, and market conditions, whereas technical analysis involves statistical analysis based on trading activities.

4. Emotional Control: Avoiding impulsive decisions that are based on fear or hype is crucial. We need to ensure every decision is rooted in our calculated strategy and not swayed by market fluctuations or trends.

5. Regular portfolio review: Regular inspection of our portfolio ensures that it stays aligned with our investment goals. As the market changes, we might require to reassess the asset allocation and make necessary adjustments.

6. Take Profit and Stop Loss Orders: Setting these orders helps in securing earnings and restricting losses. It's an automatic mechanism to hold us on our planned strategy and prevents potential emotional reactions.

7. Participate in Reliable Trading Platforms: Avoid newly introduced platforms which may have not been tested adequately. Trading through a reliable platform minimizes the risk of technical failure and provides appropriate customer support when necessary.

8. Stay Updated: Information is key to trading. Knowing about global market trends, economic indicators, policy changes, important meetings, etc. can help us predict market directions and make timely decisions.

I would appreciate your thoughts on this proposed strategy to enhance our trading performance. Looking forward to discussing it further with you.
