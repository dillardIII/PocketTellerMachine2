Subject: Logic Strategy Note

Dear [Recipient],

I trust this note finds you well. As Cole's trading assistant, I have compiled a logic strategy to guide our trading activities in the foreseeable future. This strategy incorporates a keen analysis of market trends, diversification logic, and patience for significant market movements.

1. Market Analysis: We will approach trading logically by staying updated with market trends on the news, analyzing past data, and gauging investor sentiment. This will inform our buy or sell decisions rather than relying merely on speculation.

2. Diversification: To increase the likelihood of gains and decrease the risk of loss, we will ensure that our portfolio is well diversified across different stocks and asset classes. Moreover, we will maintain a healthy balance of long-term and short-term holdings to leverage quick market shifts and potential long-term growth respectively.

3. Patience: With a logic-based trading strategy, we will resist the urge to make impulsive trades based on brief market fluctuations. Instead, we'll follow our logically designed trading plan, which will more likely result in successful long-term outcomes. 

4. Consistent Evaluation: It is crucial to evaluate our trading strategy regularly to tweak it as per the changing market scenarios. This will cultivate a habit of learning from our successes and failures, making us a more efficient trading entity.

5. Risk Management: Our strategy will also practice discipline and risk management, meaning we will only invest money that we can afford to lose. We will also set stop-loss orders to prevent significant losses, and take profit orders to secure profits when trades reach our target prices.

In conclusion, our trading strategy will rely on logical and informed decisions rather than on emotions. By sticking to this plan, we will cultivate patience, discipline, and adaptability, which are essential traits for successful trading.

Warm Regards,

[Your Name]
Assistant to Cole
