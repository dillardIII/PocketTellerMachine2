Subject: Cole's Trading Strategy Note 

1. Objectives: Ensure that investment decisions align with financial goals and risk tolerance. The primary focus is on earning consistent returns with medium-risk level assets and prioritizing long-term growth.

2. Risk Management: Allocate funds into diverse investment channels to reduce exposure to any single asset. Consider both systematic and unsystematic risks affecting portfolio performance and rebalance the portfolio periodically to maintain its risk-reward profile.

3. Fundamental Analysis: Identify value assets using financial and economic indicators including P/E ratio, P/B ratio, debt level, net income, and GDP growth rate among others. Invest in assets that appear undervalued as per these indicators, ensuring they align with the overall risk-profile of the portfolio.

4. Technical Analysis: Use technical indicators and charts for timing the entries and exits effectively. Consider trends, patterns, momentum indicators, volume among other things to optimize the trade.

5. Market Analysis: Stay informed about the market sentiments, news, trends and regulatory policies that can affect the asset prices. 

6. Review: Regularly review the portfolio for rebalancing and ditching underperforming assets. 

7. Sellers & Buyers: Understand when others are selling and buying. Usually, when others are fearful and selling, it could be a good time to buy, provided our analysis supports it.

8. Exit Strategy: Have a clear exit plan for each investment before entering the trade. 

9. Patience: Investment gains are typically realized over the long term, so patience is key. Resist the urge to jump into trending investments unless they align with our strategy and goals. 

10. Continuous Learning: Investing is an ongoing learning process. Keep updating our strategies as per changing market dynamics and personal learning.

11. Ethical Considerations: Prioritize investments in companies that adhere to socially responsible and sustainable practices.

Remember, regular review and adjustment of the strategy is crucial to make sure we stay on track with our financial objectives and market dynamics. Always maintain a disciplined approach while executing the strategy, even during volatile times.
