Subject: Logic Strategy Note: Enhancing Trading Performance

Dear Cole,

The world of trading is challenging, and to increase our returns, it’s important that we operate consciously and strategically. Here’s an outline of our new strategy, centered around logical and informed decision-making.

1. Market Research: It’s crucial we conduct thorough and ongoing research about market trends, economic indicators, company profiles, and geopolitical events. We should utilize analytical tools to predict future directions and make decisions based on factual data.

2. Risk Management: Define the tolerable loss before investing to avoid exposing our portfolio to unnecessary risk. The use of stop-loss orders can provide a higher level of control over potential losses. Diversification, too, can help to mitigate risk.

3. Emotion Control: Trading decisions must be devoid of emotions like fear or greed. We must make decisions based on analytical findings rather than impulses. A calm, disciplined attitude will help us stay on course.

4. Consistent Review: We should constantly monitor and review our trading strategy’s effectiveness, making necessary adjustments based on economic climates and current market conditions.

5. Patience: Expecting quick gains often leads to rush decisions, so it's important to remember that trading is a long-term commitment. Waiting for the right opportunity and selling at the opportune moment is key.

6. Reinforce Learning: We should continually educate ourselves on new techniques, evolving market trends, and learn from successful traders. This would ensure our strategies remain up-to-date and competitive.

7. Regulation Compliance: We must always operate within legal boundaries and comply with established financial regulations. The consequences of non-compliance are severe and detrimental to our trading career.

8. Continual Testing: Implementing a strategy requires continuous back testing on historical data and tweaking based on results. This can help us build successful models and make better-informed decisions.

By remaining methodical, patient, and focused, I am confident we can increase our trading success. We will make decisions based on clarity and critical analysis, negating the influence of unfounded speculation.
