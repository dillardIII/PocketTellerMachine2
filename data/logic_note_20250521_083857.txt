Subject: Logic Strategy Note

Dear Team,

Successful trading relies on a robust and logical approach that minimizes impulsive decisions and focuses on meticulous evaluation of opportunities in the market landscape. Here's a strategy note to guide our future operations.

1. **Research & Knowledge:** Thorough understanding about the assets/commodities we are dealing in is crucial. Ensure you are well versed with all current market practices and trends.

2. **Risk Management:** Establish a clear parameter of the risk you're willing to take for each trade. Always remember that it's not about the number of trades we win, but the profit we make when we win.

3. **Diversification:** Do not place all your eggs in one basket. Portfolio diversification is essential to minimize losses in case a sector of the market crashes.

4. **Tactical Analysis:** Use technical analysis tools to determine potential investment opportunities. Also, consider economic factors and global events that can impact the market.

5. **Clear Buy/Sell Strategy:** Set clear rules for when to buy or sell assets. This removes the emotional aspect of trading, helping to minimize losses.

6. **Consistency:** Do not change your strategy based on short-term market fluctuations. Stick to your logic strategy for the long-term.

7. **Stop Loss and Take Profit Points:** Always set your stop loss and take profit points before entering a trade. This will limit your loss, if the market moves against you, and will lock in your profit once your desired level is reached.

8. **Continuous Learning and Improvement:** The market is continuously changing. Learning never stops, always be ready to update your knowledge base and improve your strategy accordingly.

9. **Evaluation and Record Keeping:** Keep detailed records of all trades to analyze any flaws or weaknesses in the logic strategy. Regular evaluation is key to overall improvement.

Remember, a logical strategy minimizes bias and emotion, promoting sound trading decisions even in turbulent markets. The focus remains on data, trends, and other market indicators to make calculated and strategic choices.
