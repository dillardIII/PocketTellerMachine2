Subject: Logic Strategy Note for Maximized Trading Efficiency

Dear Team,

In line with our continuous effort to enhance our trading efficiency, we have developed a strategy based upon strict logic principals. Herein, we detail out the protocols and measures to be considered while navigating our trading terrain.

1. **Regular Market Analysis**: Constantly review our positions in the market using logic-based tools and techniques. Automated data analysis should help identify patterns beneficial for future trades.

2. **Risk Management**: Implement logic-based risk management measures. Heavy emphasis on stop-loss, take-profit orders, and not investing more than a certain percentage of our portfolio in one trade.

3. **Volatility Measurement**: Use computing algorithms to judge market volatility. High volatility often couples with high risk but could potentially result in high rewards. 

4. **Continious Learning**: Never conclusively assume you know the market completely. Our algorithm-based learning should continuously acquire new knowledge to make better trading decisions. 

5. **Disciplined Trading**: Using logically derived algorithms, we stick to our objective of disciplined trading. This trading includes not being led by emotions but making decisions based on data, trends, and market analysis. 

6. **Strategy Evaluation**: Periodic logic-based evaluation of our trading strategies is crucial in current market environments. Using our back-testing systems, we can logically verify the effectiveness of our approach.

The adherence to this outlined logic strategy will give us an edge in our trading activities. Refined with constant engagements, it will help us to navigate the nuances of different markets effectively.

Let's put our shoulders to the wheel for the successful implementation of our logic strategy.

Best Regards,

[Your name]
