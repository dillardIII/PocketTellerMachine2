Subject: Strategy Note: Trading Logic and Current Market Approach 

Dear Team,

As we navigate the ever-changing landscape of the financial markets, we need to implement a strategic approach towards our trading operations. This Note is to shed light on our current trading logic strategy that prioritizes long-term profitability, risk management, and sustainability.

1. **Fundamental Analysis**: Focusing on fundamental indicators, such as economic health, event impact, and company financial statements should form the backbone of our decision-making processes. It gives us an understanding of the overall picture.

2. **Technical Analysis**: This is also crucial in predicting price trends and patterns. It should involve a thorough study of historical market data, including price and volume.

3. **Risk Management**: A critical element to safeguard our portfolio is the use of stop loss orders and taking profits at designated levels. Each trade should only expose a small percentage of our total portfolio to mitigate risk.

4. **Diversification**: Spreading trades across a variety of assets is vital to mitigate risk. We should balance our portfolio between high-risk, high-return assets and low-risk, low-return ones.

5. **Emotion Control**: Our trading decisions should be based on logic and strategy rather than emotions. It is imperative that we treat trading as a business with strict discipline and not get swayed by market sentiments.

6. **Continual Learning**: Markets are dynamic and constantly evolving. We should continually learn, adapt, and adjust our strategies based on market trends, price patterns, market news, and other essential factors.

7. **Automated Trading**: Implementing automated trading systems can be beneficial in eliminating emotional response who adhere strictly to pre-determined parameters.

8. **Leverage**: While leverage can magnify profits, it can also lead to substantial losses. Hence, it should be applied judiciously and with proper risk management strategies in place.

It is important to reiterate that there is no 'one-size-fits-all' trading strategy. We must remain patient, disciplined, and flexible, continually studying market shifts and adjusting our strategies accordingly.
