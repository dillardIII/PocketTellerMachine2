Subject: Cole's Trading Logic Strategy Note

Dear Team,

This note aims to guide us all through our current trading strategy, which is built upon a firm logic foundation. This involves a systematic, evidence-based approach to derive maximum profits and to ensure risk mitigation. 

1. Fundamental Analysis: Our trading starts with an in-depth understanding of macroeconomic indicators and company-specific financials. We believe in the vitality of micro and macro components in determining a company's actual worth. Therefore, thorough analysis and due diligence on every potential investment is critical.

2. Technical Analysis: We use analytical tools and chart patterns to predict future price movements. Technical analysis will provide us with data on optimal entry and exit levels. This should complement our fundamental perspective and not replace it. 

3. Diversify Portfolios: This is a cornerstone of our trading strategy. A diverse portfolio reduces the impact of any single stock's performance on the overall portfolio. The portfolio should be periodically rebalanced to maintain the desired level of diversification.

4. Risk Management: This involves setting realistic profit targets and maximum acceptable loss levels. We adhere strictly to Stop Loss triggers and maintain a healthy risk to reward ratio in all trades.

5. Continuous Learning: We aim to learn from each trade, whether profit or loss. The market is dynamic, and continuous learning is the only way we can adapt to these changes.

6. Patience and Discipline: Emotions can strongly influence trading decisions. Thus, it is essential to remain patient, disciplined, and stick to our trading plan.

7. Regular Market Monitoring: Keep abreast of market news and updates. Understanding the effect of these elements will help us make informed trading decisions.

8. Consistent Evaluation and Adjustment: The market evolves continuously, and so should our strategy.

We believe in this strategic approach, which is based on a blend of solid research, technical analysis, and disciplined execution. Please review and incorporate this guidance into your daily trading routine.

Best,

[Your Name]
