Title: Logic Strategy Note

Dear Cole,

As we set forth in the trading world, it is imperative to employ well-defined logic strategies to ensure the best possible profits, reduce risks and avoid irrational trading decisions. Here's a draft of our logic trading strategy:

1. Objectivity and Discipline: We will base all decisions on an objective measure of market direction, guided by precise guidelines and not influenced by emotional biases. 

2. Well-Researched Decisions: Prior to making any trade, comprehensive research will be done to understand market trends, fundamentals and potentials.

3. Risk Management: Under no circumstance should we risk more than 1-2% on a single trade. We must place stop-loss orders to prevent potential losses from wiping out our capital.

4. Diversification: Splitting the investment across different assets will help us to mitigate risk significantly and seize various market opportunities. 

5. Regular Assessment: Consistent evaluation of our trades is essential to learn from our past wins and losses. This will help us to improve our strategies over time.

6. Reliable Brokers: We must trade with a trusted, licensed, and regulated brokerage firm that offers reasonable trading conditions.

7. Never Overtrade: All trades will be based on thorough analysis and not on instincts, hunch, or attempting to make up for previous losses.

8. Adaptability: We should be ready to adapt our strategy as per the situation in the fast-changing trading world.

Remember, the key is not to make money quickly, but rather to make it consistently over a long period. Consistency brings compounding, which ultimately translates to significant gains.

Best,
[Your Name]
