Subject: Logic Strategy Note for Optimizing Trades 

I. Overview
This logic strategy note has been created to optimize our trading strategy and make our decision-making process more efficient. The ultimate goal is to maximize profitability while minimizing the risk associated with each trade.

II. Market Analysis 
Begin with a thorough analysis of the market. Understand the current trends, developments, and pedestrian sentiments. Analyze historical patterns, and set a logical basis for our decisions.

III. Set Clear Objectives 
Clearly outline the objectives of each trade: what are the predicted profits, what is the acceptable loss, and what is the timeframe for keeping the position open. These objectives should align with Cole's overall investment goals.

IV. Risk Management 
Implement a robust risk management strategy for every trade. For every potential gain, we must be aware of the potential risks associated. Investments should have a favorable risk-reward ratio. We should also diversify our trading to avoid substantial loss in one area.

V. Utilize the Stop-Loss Order 
Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses from trades. It's a suitable method to cap an unacceptable level of loss on a trade and mitigate risk. Inputs regarding stop-loss orders need to be logical and strategic to avoid too-early sale of stocks.

VI. Stay Updated 
Ensure up-to-date knowledge on the companies of our trades by continually following up on significant news, earnings reports, and market trends related to them. 

VII. Regular Performance Review 
This will help us gauge the performance of our trading processes and amend them accordingly. It provides insights on what works and what doesn't and can help redefine the trading strategies based on market volatility.

VIII. Adaptable Approach 
Our approach must change in response to market behavior. It is essential to regularly modify our methods based on market dynamics, industry trends, and economic indicators.

IX. Patience 
Exercise patience in the trading process. Avoid rushed decisions based on temporary market sentiments. We need to logically invest time to observe trends and patterns.

X. Emotional Control 
Trading decisions should not be influenced by emotions, but rather cold hard facts and figures. Fear and greed should be kept at bay while making trading choices. 

To conclude, the logic in trading comes from a mix of detailed market analysis, clear goal setting, risk management, stay updated, and maintaining patience and emotional composure. The application of these strategies combined will lead to optimal trading performance.
