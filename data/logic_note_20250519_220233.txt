Title: Cole's Trading Logic Strategy Note

1. Portfolio Diversification: It is paramount to spread investments across a diverse range of assets. This strategy aids in minimizing risks and providing a buffer against market volatility. 

2. Accurate Research: Ensuring thorough and precise research into organizations we think about investing in, including their financial strength, management teams, ethics, the relevance of their products and services, and their marketplace position. 

3. Monitoring Market Trends: Staying informed and updated on general economic conditions, geopolitics, and market patterns would guide us to make astute decisions and identify opportunities faster.

4. Risk Management: Establish a calculated amount of risk that is acceptable for each trading deal. A cogent stop loss strategy to limit potential losses is an absolute essential.

5. Avoid Emotional Trading: Develop an objective approach towards trading. Avoid decisions driven by fear, greed, or other emotions. 

6. Regular Portfolio Evaluation: Conduct regular assessments of our portfolio to ensure it aligns with our financial goals. 

7. Patience: Sometimes it's better to wait and watch rather than rush. Not every fluctuation in the market should prompt a sudden reaction.

8. Clear Goals: Set clear, realistic, and time-based monetary goals. This would aid in establishing a meaningful and structured trading journey. 

9. Market Entry and Exit Strategy: Have a well-defined strategy about when to enter and exit a trade. Stick to it unless there's objective data indicating a need to modify the approach.

10. Continuous Learning: The market is dynamic and change is the only constant factor. We should keep learning and upgrading our skills to meet new advancements and trends. 

Remember, intelligent trading is less about the frequency of trades made and more about the quality and strategic planning involved.
