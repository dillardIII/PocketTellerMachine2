Subject: Logic Trading Strategy 

Dear Team, 

Hope you're all doing well. I want to take this moment to share some strategy points that could potentially help increase our overall trading productivity and effectiveness. 

1. Data Driven Decisions: We need to ensure that all our trading decisions are backed by solid data. This means looking beyond the surface level number to conduct thorough research to understand the entire picture. 

2. Risk Management: It's crucial that we implement strict risk management procedures to protect our portfolio. This includes setting stop loss and take profit levels, as well as constantly monitoring and adjusting our positions based on market conditions. 

3. Diversify: Investment diversification can help us to balance the risk. It is not wise to put all eggs in one basket. Therefore, a diversified portfolio across various sectors and asset classes will help us reduce potential losses. 

4. Continuous Learning: The financial markets are constantly evolving, hence we need to stay informed about the latest news, market trends, and investment strategies. Continuous learning and training should be a key element of our strategy.

5. Emotional Control: This is of utmost importance in trading. We must make our decisions based on logic and data, not on emotions. 

6. Regular Review: Regular review of our strategies and performance is essential to make necessary amendments on time. We need to evaluate what is working and what needs improvement. 

7. Long term vision: Although day trading can be profitable, we must consider long term investments which although slower can ensure steady profits. 

Remember, our trading decisions could make or break us. Our goal should always be to minimize losses and maximize profits while staying true to our risk tolerance. Always aim for a disciplined and methodical approach to trading. 

All the best, 

[Your Name]
