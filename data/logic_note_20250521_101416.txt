Subject: Cole's Trading Logic Strategy

Dear Team, 

Trading in financial markets is a complex task which should be undertaken carefully taking into account several important factors. It is thus paramount that we follow a comprehensive set of logics to ensure that we achieve our desired objectives and minimize risk to the best of our abilities. Here are some strategies we propose to adopt:

1. Understanding the Markets: Understanding the market is the bedrock of any successful trading strategy. Collect data from multiple credible sources, including economic news, earnings reports, political climate, and market indicators, and study regular pattern and trends.

2. Risk Management: Risk management is key in trading. Our guideline will be to never risk more than 2% of our entire portfolio on any single trade. If a trade is not going as planned, we revise our strategy or completely pull out to protect capital.

3. Diversification: Diversify our portfolio to mitigate risk as well as take advantage of multiple markets. Also, knowing when to hold and when to sell is part of this strategy. 

4. Emotional Discipline: The markets can be unpredictable, and emotions can often lead to poor decisions. It is important to remain disciplined, sticking to our pre-determined strategy even when things are not going as expected.

5. Continuous learning and Adaptability: The dynamics of financial markets change rapidly. We must be open to learning always and ready to adapt our strategy as per the changing scenarios.

It's important to remember that while these strategies can help guide our trading, there is no foolproof system for guaranteed success. It will require continual review and adjustment, but these principles provide a solid starting point.

Should you have any questions or need further clarifications, feel free to reach out.
