Subject: Logic Strategy Note 

Dear Team,

Moving forward, it's integral that we structure our trading strategy to not only align with our financial goals but also to embrace the volatilities of the market. As such, here's a logical strategic plan for our trading activities:

1. Trade Selection: Let's focus on the trades that we understand the best. While diversification is important, a more logical approach is to limit trading to the industries and sectors with which we're most familiar. 

2. Risk Management: Before initiating any trades, identify the level of risk involved. Each trade should have a preset risk parameter to ensure we aren't exposing ourselves too much in one area.

3. Long and Short-Term Goals: Establish both long and short-term goals for our trades. Short term goals offer quick returns for immediate strategies whilst long term goals focus on prolonged yield of higher returns.

4. Entry and Exit Strategy: Establish a calculated 'entry' and 'exit' strategy for every trade. Knowing when to get in and get out helps provide a level of control over the unpredictability of the market.

5. Diversification: While we should focus on areas we understand, itâ€™s important to have a diverse portfolio to cushion the impact should a particular sector or market drop sharply. 

6. Consistent Analysis and Adjustment: The market is dynamic and continually changing. Ensure regular analysis of both the market and our own trading performance. Based on this analysis, adjust trading strategies as needed.

Remember, the core of our strategy is the logical and informed decision-making process.
