Subject: Logic Strategy Note for Trading

Dear Team,

As we venture further into the trading market, it is essential that we adapt a structured approach in our daily operations. Here is our proposed logic strategy to guide us along:

1. Fundamental Analysis: Ensure we fully understand the asset we are considering for trade. This includes the analysis of all data relevant to the asset - such as financial reports, industry trends, and economic indicators.

2. Risk Management: Always determine the acceptable level of risk before entering a trade. We need to establish a risk-reward ratio that we are comfortable with and make it a point to adhere to it.

3. Diversification: Do not put 'all the eggs' in one basket. To minimise risk, split the investment across different assets and sectors.

4. Constant Monitoring: Keep a close eye on the market moves, news and other external events that might impact the asset prices.

5. Emotional Control: Crucially, always maintain our emotions in check. Decision-making should be based on analysis and strategy, not driven by fear or greed.

6. Performance Evaluation: Regularly assess the performance of our trades to identify any mistakes and continually refine our strategy. 

7. Continuous Learning: The market is always evolving, thus we should remain open to learning and adapting our strategies accordingly.

By adhering to this trading strategy, we can limit losses, maximize gains, and navigate the unpredictable waters of the trading market successfully. Remember, the key to successful trading is not to win every trade, but to come out with a positive balance over time.

Best,
