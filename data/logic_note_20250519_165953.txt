Subject: Logic Strategy for Trading Plan

Dear Team,

The trading market requires a solid strategy backed up by logical reasoning and analysis. After extensive consideration, here are some strategic points we need to endorse in our trading methods.

1. Thorough Research: Each trade should be preceded by a comprehensive analysis of the market landscape, the entity in question, and global economic conditions. 

2. Risk Management: Limit potential losses by determining a stop-loss limit for every position we take. Not all trades will be profitable, but minimizing losses is critical to long-term success.

3. Diversification: Invest in a balanced mix of stocks, commodities, and other financial instruments. This will dispense risk and maximize the potential for sustainable profits.

4. Be Patient: Trading isn't just about making immediate profits; it's about making consistent profits over the long term. Let's allow the market to confirm our assumptions before taking actions.

5. Profit-Booking: It's essential not to let greed drive our trading decisions. We should always book profits periodically even if the market is in favor. Holding our positions for too high expectations can turn profitable trades into losses.

6. Ignore Market Noise: It's vital to making decisions based on facts, data, and logical analysis rather than reacting to every market rumor or news.

7. Regular Review and Learning: Let's review our trades and strategies regularly to learn from our successes and mistakes. This will help us refine and improve our trading logic over time.

All the above strategies are based on logic and disciplined trading methods. As we strive for continuous growth and improvement in our trading practices, these strategies will guide us in making calculated decisions, mitigating risks, and maximising profits. 

Best,
[Your name]
