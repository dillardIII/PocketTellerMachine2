Subject: Cole's Trading Strategy 

Dear Team,

After meticulously assessing the current market trends, coupled with our investment goals, I propose the following progressive trading strategy which should provide us with a beneficial path moving forward.

1. Diversification: We shouldn't put all our eggs in one basket. Therefore, our investments should be diversified across different asset classes such as equities, commodities, bonds, etc. 

2. Informed Decisions: Prioritize comprehensive research on every potential trading opportunity before making any decision. Reviewing annual reports, news, market trends, and financial metrics will aid us in making smart choices.

3. Risk Management: Setting a stop-loss order for each trade will minimize our potential losses in volatile conditions. Always trade in accordance to our risk tolerance.

4. Regular Monitoring: Constant evaluation of the market will help us adjust our strategy readily. Daily review of our portfolio is necessary to understand the gains or losses and act accordingly.

5. Long-term Perspective: Despite short-term volatility, we need to make trades considering a long-term view. Remember that trading is not about getting rich quick, but about growing wealth over time.

6. Patience: It takes time to master the psychology of trading. Patience is crucial, both for learning and waiting for the perfect opportunity to trade.

7. Continuous Learning: The financial market environment is fluid and alterations are bound to happen. We should continually acquire knowledge about financial markets and trading. 

Please remember, this strategic approach serves as a guide and like all strategies, it may need to be tweaked based on market volatility or changes in our goals. I encourage all to stay informed, optimistic, and most importantly, patient as we navigate these financial waters together. 

Best,
