Subject: Logic Strategy Note

Dear Cole,

Having analyzed the current market situation, it's time to set out our trading strategy built on logic and reasoning. The following guidelines aim to make our trading process efficient, risk-controlled, and most importantly, profitable. 

1. Trend Analysis: Trends are our friends. We should follow the market trends instead of always trying to predict. It's pertinent to recognize the trends - upwards, downwards, or sideways and strategically trade accordingly.

2. Diversification: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. We should allocate our investments across various financial instruments, sectors, and other classifications to mitigate risk. 

3. Stop-Loss Orders: It's essential to set stop-loss orders for every trade we place. This default 'safety net' will limit the possible losses and keep us disciplined.

4. Risk Management: Control the risk by limiting trades to a certain percentage of our overall portfolio. Not more than 5% should be invested in a single trade, leaving room for error and preventing crippling losses.

5. Regular Monitoring: Constantly monitor the market and our trading positions. Not just daily closing prices, but intra-day price updates and volume patterns should be examined thoroughly.

6. Fundamental and Technical Analysis: We should aim to make informed decisions based on the real value of the asset using fundamental analysis and chart patterns, price trends, or market behaviours using technical analysis.

7. Patience and Discipline: Do not rush the trades, rather let them come organically. Patience, consistency, and discipline are the principles to profitable trading. 

8. Emotional Control: Keep emotions at bay when dealing with trades. Greed and fear often lead to mistakes. Never trade more than what we can afford to lose.

9. Periodical Profit and Loss Assessment: Monitor our overall performance regularly to recognize improvements or areas needing adjustments. It's essential to learn from both our successful and non-successful trades.

10. Continuous Learning: Always be open for new insights, strategies, and keep updated with global and domestic economic indicators.

We will review this strategy periodically and make improvements where necessary to enhance our trading performance. The key is to maintain a balance between risk and reward and stay committed to our trading strategy.
