Subject: Logic Strategy

Dear Team, 

In order to maximize our returns in this volatile market, I would like to set forth a set of strategic principles that are founded in logic and probability. Here are some key facets of our trading strategy:

1. Trend Following: Historically, it has been proved that trends provide immense trading opportunities. Our prime focus should be to identify these trends - both short-term and long-term - and make investments accordingly. 

2. Diversification: To mitigate the risk associated with our investments, it is crucial to diversify our portfolio. It spreads the risk across various investment sectors, hence, reducing the risk associated with the total portfolio.

3. Stop Losses: Setting up stop losses will safeguard us from significant potential losses. When a trade does not go as per our prediction and hits the set stop loss point, our position will automatically close to prevent further losses. 

4. Continual Market Research: It is of utmost importance to stay updated with market news, financial developments, and economic events as they have a strong influence on the price movements.

5. Regular Review: Lastly, we must make it a point to review and rebalance our portfolio to accommodate changes in market trends and our risk tolerance.

This strategy is by no means conclusive and should continuously be adapted according to the market scenarios and risk appetite. The key here is to make informed decisions and leverage the power of logic and mathematics in our favor. Should there be any doubts or queries regarding the same, please do not hesitate to get in touch. 

Kindly consider this as a basic framework that we will build on together. 

Best Regards,
