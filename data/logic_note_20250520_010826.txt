Title: Effective Trading Strategy Conceptualization 

Dear Team,

It is paramount to establish a solid and realistic trading strategy that will guide our trading decisions. Here are some ideas and action plans to optimize our trading structure:

1. Comprehensive Market Analysis
Before any trading agreement, we should conduct extensive market research that involves both technical and fundamental analysis. Use key indicators such as price trend, volume change, and market sentiment to determine promising opportunities.

2. Risk Management Strategy
Risk is inherent in trading. But, we can significantly minimize it by setting stop-loss orders, predefining the risk per trade, and never risking more than a specific percent of our portfolio on one trade.

3. Set Profit Targets
Establish a clear profit taking strategy. It is generally advised to have a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2. This ratio will ensure that, even if we are wrong about half the trades we execute, we’ll still generate a profit.

4. Diversification
We can’t emphasize enough on the need to have a diversified portfolio. Diversification could potentially lead to overall portfolio risk reduction.

5. Regularly Evaluate Performance
Schedule periodic reviews to evaluate our trading strategy’s performance. This evaluation could allow us to identify any potential area of improvement.

6. Learning and Adaptability
The trading market is dynamic and unpredictable. Hence, constant learning and adaptability should be an integral part of our trading strategy. Be open and ready to adapt to new knowledge, techniques, and trading tools that could enhance our trading performance.

7. Leverage technology 
Effective utilization of trading software and AI can simplify our trade selection and analysis process. They offer precise calculations and eliminate human error.

Remember, we are trading in a market sphere that operates on the uncertain future. Being patient and disciplined throughout our trading journey, combined with a meticulous strategy, sets us on track to a successful trading experience.

Stay focussed and trade well.

Kind regards,
