Subject: Comprehensive Trading Logic Strategy 

Dear Cole, 

I am writing to provide a trading strategy that will help guide your investment decisions and optimize your trading performance based on current and future market tides. This strategy is built on rigorous logic to allow for minimizing risk while maximizing potential gain.

1. **Asset Diversification:** Diversify your trading portfolio across different types of instruments such as stocks, commodities, forex, ETFs and potentially bonds. The aim is not to over-concentrate in a single asset or market.

2. **Market research:** Continuously follow relevant financial news, market trends, government policies and geopolitical events. Also, monitor industry-specific updates to stay ahead of the curve.

3. **Technical Analysis:** Use statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume, and apply indicators and patterns to predict future movement.

4. **Fundamental Analysis:** Evaluate a securityâ€™s intrinsic value by focusing on variables that could impact the business's future prospects.

5. **Risk management:** Always set a stop-loss limit on all trades to minimize potential losses.

6. **Timing:** Base decisions not just on market analysis, but also on market timing. Consider both entry and exit points carefully, and avoid impulsive decisions.

7. **Patience and Discipline:** Keep emotions in check and adhere to the planned strategy. Tendency to over-trade should be avoided.

8. **Continuous Learning:** Markets are unpredictable. Hence, never stop learning and adapting the approach based on new knowledge or changes in the market.

9. **Record Keeping:** Keep track of your past trades, including the reasoning for the trade, the strategy used, and its outcome to learn from both successes and failures.

10. **Performance Assessment:** Regularly review your trading performance and refine your strategies as necessary. 

This logical trading strategy is designed to meet your goals and risk tolerance. However, it's important to remember that all investments involve risks, including potential loss of principal. Trading strategies should never be considered as guarantees or predictions of future results.
