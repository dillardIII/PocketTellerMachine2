Subject: Logic Strategy for Effective Trading 

Dear Team,

The purpose of this note is to discuss a logical strategy for successful trading. The strategy revolves around three key principles:

1. Formulate a plan: Start by outlining clear goals for your trades. This includes what you aim to invest, the expected returns, the cut-off point for losses, and the market situations suitable for your investments. A well laid-out plan adds an analytical and logical perspective to trading.

2. Market Analysis: Stay updated with market trends, economic data, and significant geopolitical events. Make use of technical analysis along with fundamental one. The logic here is to understand the sentiment of the traders in the market and base your trades on sound research rather than speculation or emotions. 

3.Effective Risk Management: Always remember to maintain diversity in your portfolio to distribute and limit potential risks. Setting stop-loss points can also help limit downside risk. Furthermore, it's wise to reinvest profits rather than staking them in newer, riskier trades. 

4. Regular Review: Keep a track of your trades, review them at regular intervals to learn from both profits and losses. Recognize the patterns that work for your advantage and those that don't. The more you learn from your past trades, the more logically you can plan future ones.

5. Patience: Any trading operation is a matter of time. Rushing or impulsive decisions can ruin the effort we have put in. It is important to know that sometimes not operating is the best operation.

6. Avoid emotional trading: Never let fear and greed drive your trading decisions. Emotion-driven decisions could lead to irrational trading actions, impulsive decision-making, and subsequently heavy financial losses.

I hope these points provide you with a logical structure around which you can base your trading decisions and actions, with a strong emphasis on analysis, risk management, and learning.
