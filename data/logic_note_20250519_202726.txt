Subject: Logic Based Trading Strategy 

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. As Cole's trading assistant, I am writing today to establish a distinct logic-based trading strategy to be used to further optimize our trading decisions and maximize the profits. 

1. **Technical Analysis:** Utilize chart patterns and technical indicators to predict future price movements. Keep consistent track of trends, volumes, resistances and supports.

2. **Fundamental Analysis:** Investigate a company’s financials, industry position, and market condition before getting into a trade. This includes analyzing the earnings report, balance sheet, cash flow statement, and crucial economic indicators.

3. **Risk Management:** This is perhaps the core of our trading strategy. Limit the capital expenditure on each trade to a certain percentage of the total account value (1-2%). Diversification of the portfolio is also essential to reduce risk.

4. **Psychological Discipline:** Don’t let fear and greed drive your trading decisions. Stick to the plan and avoid impulsive trades. 

5. **Regularity Monitoring:** Review our strategy on a regular basis looking at all trades, both profitable and unprofitable, to understand any change in the market trend or our investment inclinations.

6. **Flexibility:** Keep the strategy flexible for adjusting with the evolving market scenario. Keep analyzing the performance and changing when required.

7. **Stop losses:** Every trade should have a stop loss which is not just about limiting losses, but also about protecting profits.

8. **News Alerts:** Examine impactful business news, world events, fiscal policy changes to seize short-term trading opportunities. 

Feel free to suggest or add any points that I may have overlooked. We are aiming to make our trades smart, which should not rely solely on instinct, but rely primarily on systematic, disciplined, and logical steps.

Have a profitable day, and for any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Best Regards,
