Subject: Logic Strategy Note for Effective Trading

1. **Adherence to The Trading Plan**: Before entering any trade, a plan encompassing entry level, exit point, and money management should be established. Adhering unswervingly to this plan can help offset impulsive trading decisions motivated by fear or greed.

2. **Risk Management**: Balance the potential profit against the risk involved in every trade. Ideally, opt for trades where the potential gain is twice the possible loss. This ensures steady profitability while minimizing the impact of inevitable losing trades.

3. **Trend Identification**: Traders should identify the 'bigger picture' trends and tailor their trades to fit within the broad market movement. This significantly reduces the risk and increases profit potential.

4. **Emotional Discipline**: Emotional stability is critical for long-term trading success. Never act on spur-of-the-moment feelings; rather base actions on established trading plans and strategies.

5. **Continuous Learning**: Constant education and staying updated with market trends is essential. This helps in understanding global market events that influence trades.

6. **Diversification**: This is key to long-term trading sustainability. Spread trades across a variety of securities to spread risk - don't 'put all eggs in one basket'.

7. **Stop-Loss Orders**: Use stop-loss orders to automatically cut losses at the predefined level. This helps in protecting the trading capital from significant damages.

8. **Performance Analysis**: Regularly analyzing trading strategies and learning from both successful and unsuccessful trades is crucial. Use past performance data to make modifications for increased effectiveness.

Please note that trading in financial instruments always carries an element of risk and it's important to only risk capital that you are prepared to lose. Implementing logical trading strategies will ensure sustainable trading in the long run.
