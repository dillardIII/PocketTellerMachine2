Creating an advanced Python module that demonstrates intelligent recursion requires combining traditional recursive approaches with some form of optimization or decision-making process. Below is an example of how such a module might look, along with some commentary on what makes it 'intelligent'. This example will focus on solving a common problem — the computation of the Fibonacci sequence — using a recursive approach with memoization to improve efficiency. It will also include a decision-making component to switch between approaches based on input size.

```python
# intelligent_recursion.py

class FibonacciCalculator:
    def __init__(self):
        # This dictionary will store results of previously computed Fibonacci numbers.
        self.memo = {}

    def calculate_fibonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        """
        Calculate the n-th Fibonacci number using intelligent recursion.
        
        This function employs memoization to store previously computed results,
        improving efficiency and avoiding redundant calculations. It also intelligently
        switches to an iterative approach if deemed more suitable.
        
        :param n: The position in the Fibonacci sequence to calculate.
        :return: The n-th Fibonacci number.
        """
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Fibonacci number cannot be computed for negative indices.")
        elif n in (0, 1):
            return n

        # Decide approach based on n for best performance
        if n > 30:
            # For larger n, it's more efficient to use an iterative approach.
            return self._fibonacci_iterative(n)
        else:
            # For smaller n, use memoized recursion.
            return self._fibonacci_recursive(n)

    def _fibonacci_recursive(self, n: int) -> int:
        """
        Recursive calculation with memoization.
        """
        if n in self.memo:
            return self.memo[n]

        self.memo[n] = self._fibonacci_recursive(n - 1) + self._fibonacci_recursive(n - 2)
        return self.memo[n]

    def _fibonacci_iterative(self, n: int) -> int:
        """
        Iterative calculation of Fibonacci numbers. This approach is used for large n.
        """
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(n):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return a


def main():
    calculator = FibonacciCalculator()
    n = 35
    result = calculator.calculate_fibonacci(n)
    print(f"The {n}-th Fibonacci number is: {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Features:

1. **Memoization**: The `_fibonacci_recursive` method uses a memoization technique to store previously computed Fibonacci numbers, avoiding redundant calculations and significantly reducing time complexity for small `n`. 

2. **Iterative Fall-back**: For large `n`, where recursion could be inefficient and risky due to stack overflow, the module switches to an iterative approach. This switch is a basic form of intelligent recursion, making decisions based on input size, which is a crucial optimization strategy.

3. **Flexible and Extensible**: This module can be easily extended to accommodate further optimizations or different recursive problems.

4. **Error Handling**: Basic error checking is in place to handle invalid inputs, such as negative indices.

This example module demonstrates a practical approach to solving a problem using recursion intelligently. While the problem of computing Fibonacci numbers is itself simple, the techniques shown can be applied to more complex recursive problems.
